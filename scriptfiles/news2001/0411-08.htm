- April 11 - Today students on five continents 

          and in some 80

          cities worldwide took to the streets to protest Citibank's (Citi) 

          leading

          role in funding environmentally and socially destructive activities. 

          From

          New York to Germany to India, students launched an international boycott

          against Citi credit cards with protests at bank branches, teach-ins 

          at

          colleges and universities, and "Cut up Your Citi Card" ceremonies. 

          Today

          also marks the second international day of protest against Citi in the 

          last

          six month, as the campaign against the banking giant gains momentum.

        

<p>"Citi is living richly off of environmental destruction," 

          commented Ilyse

          Hogue of the Rainforest Action Network "Students are outraged, 

          and are

          standing up to say, "Not With My Money!"</p>

<p>At demonstrations around the globe, concerned citizens and Citi customers

          drew attention to the company's backing of egregious projects, 

          such as the

          controversial Chad-Cameroon rainforest oil pipeline, China's Three 

          Gorges

          Dam, and expanding palm plantations in Indonesia that destroy critical

          rainforest habitat for endangered orangutans. Students also highlighted

          Citigroup's policies of sub-prime or &#145;predatory lending' 

          in urban areas that

          disproportionately affect people with lower incomes and communities 

          of

          color, as well as the corporation's sale of World Bank Bonds that 

          strap

          developing nations with increasing debt.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the WTO protests in Seattle, students, environmentalists,

          human rights activists and economic justice advocates are now turning 

          their

          attention towards the corporate financial sector, in particular Citi.

          Consumers today are increasingly demanding social and environmental

          responsibility from their banks.</p>

<p>"Student consumers are the bread and butter of Citibank's 

          credit card

          business, as the company counts on them to become long-time customers," 

          said

          Hogue. "Building on a tradition of student activism from the 60's 

          to

          Apartheid to sweatshops, the growing ranks of student activists are 

          standing

          up to hold Citi accountable."</p>

<p>The campaign's goal is to transform Citi's funding practices. 

          Citigroup is

          America's largest financial institution, yet the industry leader 

          uses

          virtually no social or environmental criteria in its investment

          decision-making.</p>

<p>Today's events are also sponsored by Student Environmental Action 

          Coalition,

          Free the Planet and Just Act.
