- February 17 - Responding to President Bush&#146;s issuance today of fourexecutive orders changing federal labor policy, Wellstone strongly criticized

the decision for the harsh  impact it will have on American workers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush&#146;s executive action  today  is a direct assault on American

workers and their families.  It is meant to have a chilling effect on the

ability of working men and women to organize and bargain collectively for decent

wages and benefits, and basic job security &#150; all central to the well-being of

working families,&#148; Wellstone said.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If this is the opening shot in a long-haul effort to roll back workers rights

and protections,  President Bush will find stiff resistance in Congress and

among working Americans across our country.  Following on the heels of his

proposal to give big tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, but not to working

families, today&#146;s executive orders reversing good protections of American

workers sends a terrible message.  This is no way to set the tone for

bipartisanship,&#148; Wellstone added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush executive orders today will:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                   Require federal contractors to post a notice telling workers

they have a

                      right under a 1988 Supreme Court ruling not to pay

portions of their dues

                      that sponsor political activities. Unions are a prime

source of money and

                      grass-roots organizing for Democrats.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                    Revoke the ''project labor agreement,'' which requires

contractors in

                      many federally financed projects to be unionized. The

provision, employed

                      at the discretion of states, is an issue in an expensive

proposal to replace

                      the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on heavily traveled Interstate

95 between

                      Virginia and Maryland.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                    Dissolve the National Partnership Council, a Clinton

organization that

                      sought to get government agencies and unions to resolve

their differences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                    Revoke a Clinton policy of job protection for employees of

contractors at

                      federal buildings when the project is awarded to another

contractor.</font></p>
