<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BURLINGTON, VT - October 2 -  For more than half a century, Dave Dellinger has been a nonviolent warrior 

for peace and social justice. From his refusal to register for the draft at 

the outbreak of World War II, through the repressive 1950s and tumultuous 

60s, and onward until today, Dave has enlivened progressive movements with 

his indomitable spirit and genius for using protest as a way to express love 

-- even for his most intractable opponents.   </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 20, Dave's inspiring life and continuing work will be honored at a 

gala celebration at Memorial Auditorium Annex in Burlington, Vermont. Organized by 

friends and political comrades, the festivities will include a dinner and 

program of music, presentation on Dave's career, and testimonials by many of 

those who have struggled with him and his partner Elizabeth Peterson over the 

years. The event begins at 6 p.m. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The host committee for the Saturday gala includes historian Howard Zinn, 

Chicago 8 co-defendants such as Tom Hayden and John Froines, Grace Paley, Bob Nichols, Jay Craven, Robin Lloyd, Greg Guma, and Doreen Kraft. On the 

following morning, a related discussion on politics, history and film will be 

held during the Vermont International Film Festival, a sponsor of the 

celebration. Moderated by Craven, the invited panelists include Hayden, Zinn, 

and film expert Peter Biskend, among others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The weekend festivities are also sponsored by <a href="http://www.towardfreedom.com/" target="_new">Toward Freedom</a>, a progressive 

world affairs magazine, whose board of directors Dave has co-chaired for the 

past 15 years. TF is currently celebrating 50 years of continuous 

publication, and, in conjunction with ongoing work by Dave and Elizabeth, has 

just launched a new prison rights project.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond honoring Dave and Elizabeth, a major goal of celebration is to create 

a retirement/project fund for them. Among other things, it will help to 

provide them with necessary personal assistance and support their visits with 

prisoners. More details on the fund and related projects will be available 

during the weekend.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To reserve a seat or make a contribution to the Dellinger Fund, make checks 

payable to Toward Freedom, and write &quot;Dellinger Celebration Fund&quot; in the memo 

line.  Seating for the dinner and program costs $25 per ticket. For the 

program only, the price is $10 per ticket. Due to limited seating, early 

reservations are recommended. Write to Dellinger Celebration, c/o Robin 

Lloyd, 300 Maple St., Burlington, VT 05401, or call (802) 862-4929 for 

further information.</font></p>
