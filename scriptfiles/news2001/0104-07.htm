- January 4 - Ford and Firestone company officials ignored crucial information

when deciding which Firestone tires to recall last year, and as a result, potentially

dangerous tires are still on the road and should be recalled immediately, according to <a href="http://www.citizen.org/fireweb/firereport.htm">a report released today by Public Citizen

and Safetyforum.com</a>.

<p>Now a top Ford official has admitted in a deposition that the Wilderness AT tires are

not &quot;robust,&quot; meaning that they are not as strong and durable as they should be,

and that they are susceptible to failure with variations in inflation pressure, operating

conditions, load and speed.</p>



<p>Last year&#146;s recall focused on ATX and ATX II tires and only some Wilderness AT

tires -- specifically those 15-inch Wilderness AT tires made in Decatur, Ill. But

Wilderness AT tires made elsewhere for the Ford Explorer have the same flawed design that

could cause the tread to separate, the report concludes.</p>



<p>In deciding which tires to recall, Ford analyzed only one narrow database and ignored

information about tire failures that spawned major litigation claims, consumer complaints

and adjustment records that show replacement of equipment under warranty, the report says.</p>



<p>&quot;Ford and Firestone officials are focused on protecting their bottom line instead

of the people whose lives are literally riding on these tires,&quot; said Public Citizen

President Joan Claybrook. &quot;For the sake of highway travelers everywhere, all

Firestone Wilderness tires that were made for the Ford Explorer should be recalled from

the market, not just those made in Decatur. These tires on Ford Explorers cause

catastrophic crashes resulting in horrible injuries and death.&quot;</p>



<p>The recall should be expanded to include all Wilderness AT P235/75R15 and P255/70R16,

the two groups concluded. If the companies refuse to do it, the National Highway Traffic

Safety Administration (NHTSA) should require it, they said.</p>



<p>&quot;Company officials have no foundation in fact to be claiming that last year&#146;s

recall has solved the problem and that everything is fine now,&quot; said Ralph Hoar,

director of Safetyforum.com. &quot;It&#146;s not. There are seriously deficient tires

still on the road.&quot;</p>



<p>As of December 2000, NHTSA&#146;s database had consumer reports of 4,308 Firestone tire

tread separations or other tire failures. Of the incidents where enough information was

available to make a distinction, 1,060 -- or 97 percent of -- incidents of failure

involved non-recalled Wilderness tires, and 34 incidents involved recalled tires.

&quot;Predictably, that number will increase as Wilderness tires accumulate the exposure

that produced the epidemic of ATX and ATX II failures, injuries and deaths,&quot; Hoar

said. </p>



<p>In a Dec. 21 deposition, Tom Baughman, engineering director for Ford&#146;s truck

operations, stated that the 15-inch Wilderness AT tires &quot;are not robust against

variations and inflation pressure and in operating condition, load and speed.&quot;</p>



<p>According to NHTSA, tread separations involving Firestone tires have resulted in 148

deaths and more than 500 injuries. In December, Firestone issued a report citing a variety

of reasons for the tread separations, including the design of the Explorer, Ford&#146;s

recommendation for a relatively low inflation pressure of 26 pounds per square inch,

manufacturing problems in Decatur, the tire&#146;s design and customer misuse of the

tires. </p>



<p>Ford, meanwhile, concluded that the tire&#146;s design created stresses in certain

areas, and that manufacturing processes in Decatur compounded the problem, allowing cracks

to form between the steel belts. </p>



<p>Today&#146;s report also notes that the companies narrowed the scope of the recall even

before determining the cause for the tread separations. </p>



<p>&quot;It seems odd that Ford and Firestone could be so sure that the problem with

Wilderness AT tires was limited to those made in Decatur, when company officials still

weren&#146;t sure what was causing the problem,&quot; Claybrook said.</p>



<p>Although Ford has conceded that non-recalled Wilderness AT tires are susceptible to

failure in hot climates, the company has defended the decision to keep the tires on the

market.</p>



<p>The report notes that the Wilderness AT tire recall in the U.S. was limited to 15-inch

tires, even though NHTSA data show significant failures in 16-inch Wilderness tires, and

even though the company recalled 16-inch Wilderness tires in other countries, such as

Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador<b>.</b></p>
