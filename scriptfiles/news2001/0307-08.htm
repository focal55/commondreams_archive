- March 7 - City parks departments 

  used at least 75,000 pounds of pesticides in Texas public parks in 1998, almost 

  one-third of which classify as moderately or highly toxic under Environmental 

  Protection Agency standards, a study released today by the Texas Pesticide Information 

  Network shows.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Texas Pesticide Information Network, 

  an Austin-based nonprofit organization, surveyed the 25 largest metropolitan 

  areas in Texas to determine the magnitude, frequency and potential health risks 

  of toxic chemical use in parks. The results are analyzed in a report, Play at 

  Your Own Risk: the Hidden Dangers of Pesticide Use in Texas' City Parks, and 

  accompanying Web site, <a href="http://www.txpin.org/parks">http://www.txpin.org/parks</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the cities surveyed, Midland ranked 

  first both in pesticide use per acre and percentage of toxic pesticide applications, 

  with 74 percent of its pesticides bearing the EPA's DANGER label (second only 

  to the agency's POISON/DANGER distinction.) Odessa and Brownsville ranked next 

  in toxicity, while Garland, Wichita Falls, Irving and Tyler followed Midland 

  in pesticide use per acre. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cities with the lowest pesticide 

  use indices included Corpus Christi, El Paso, College Station, San Antonio and 

  Lubbock.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Contrary to popular conception, 

  pesticides are not safe, particularly for children,&quot; said Reggie James, 

  director of CU's Southwest Regional Office. &quot;When even seemingly benign 

  pest-killers are linked to cancer, it's time to examine the potential dangers 

  we're exposed to every day in the name of pretty grass and ant-free picnics.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 25 metropolitan areas surveyed 

  include a combined population of 8.8 million people and 2,922 city parks occupying 

  more than 76,000 acres. In addition to the 75,000 pounds of pesticides applied, 

  the cities reported using at least 100,000 pounds of &quot;weed-and-feed&quot; 

  fertilizers often laced with pesticides. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While communities in other states, 

  including California and New York, have begun to phase out toxic pesticide practices, 

  a law passed in Texas in 1993 actually prohibits cities from regulating pesticide 

  sales and use. Texas also lags behind states that require city parks departments 

  to report their pesticide practices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since Texas does not require 

  cities to report even basic details about pesticide use, as some states now 

  do, it is difficult to make a comprehensive assessment of the potential effects 

  of pesticide use in city parks,&quot; said Mary Kelly, director of the Texas 

  Center for Policy Studies. &quot;Furthermore, without a reporting requirement, 

  there is little public oversight or accountability for pesticide use in parks 

  and incentives for using healthier alternatives to pesticides may be reduced.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The golf courses surveyed in the 

  study used four times more pesticides per acre than other types of parks on 

  average. They also tended to use more toxic pesticides.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herbicide use accounted for a whopping 

  75 percent of the cities' total pesticide applications, while insecticides represented 

  19 percent of applications. Particularly troubling is the widespread use of 

  the herbicide glyphosphate, sold in stores as Roundup, Rodeo and Kleen-Up, which 

  has been linked to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in animals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twelve cities out of 26 said they 

  used the insecticide Dursban and similar insecticides containing the active 

  ingredient chlorpyrifos - banned by the EPA in June 2000 because of its potential 

  adverse effects on children's nervous system and brain development. Dursban 

  accounted for more than one-quarter of overall insecticide applications in parks. 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA ruling allows Dursban to 

  remain on retail shelves through December 2001. Professional applicators may 

  continue using existing stock of Dursban after its sale is banned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This study has two broad implications,&quot; 

  James of Consumers Union said. &quot;One, it's time for Texas to institute a 

  reporting requirement to better track pesticide use. Two, the state Legislature 

  should give communities back the power to regulate pesticides and explore healthier 

  alternatives. Why does it make sense to deprive a municipality of the right 

  to control pesticide use within its jurisdiction, when safer parks demand it?&quot; 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Key policy recommendations in the 

  CU report include:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Keep local pesticide use 

    information in a central location, preferably computerized in a format easily 

    accessible to the public, government officials and pest control professionals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Require cities over a 

    certain size to report annual pesticide use information to the Texas Structural 

    Pest Control Board for analysis and examination.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Repeal the state law that 

    prohibits any city, county or other local body from regulating its own pesticide 

    use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Post visible, informative 

    and easy-to-understand notice before and after pesticide application in public 

    parks.</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Require that local governments 

    adopt an &quot;integrated pest management&quot; policy in public parks that 

    reduces pesticide use wherever possible and uses the least toxic treatments 

    available when pesticide use is unavoidable. Texas' public school districts 

    have already implemented IPM policies.
