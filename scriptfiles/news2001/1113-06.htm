- November 13 - Heeding the recent calls of national and international aid 

  organizations, the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center today urged Coloradans, 

  and U.S. citizens in general, to press for a halt to the bombing of Afghanistan 

  that would allow desperately needed food and medical supplies to get through.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Numerous relief agencies (including the United Nations' World 

  Food Program, the International Red Cross, Oxfam, Christian Aid and Doctors 

  Without Borders) have issued pleas to the U.S. government to help avert what 

  the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization website calls &quot;the threat of 

  an impending mass starvation in the country [of Afghanistan].&quot; Continuous 

  bombing has created a situation so unstable that in October, despite their best 

  efforts, these organizations were only able to deliver one quarter of the food 

  necessary to stave off the impending starvation of 7.5 million. With a matter 

  of days remaining before Afghanistan's extraordinarily harsh winter makes many 

  roads impassable, social justice organizations are attempting to galvanize Americans 

  to action regionally and nationally. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The RMPJC's information (<a href="http://www.rmpjc.org/2001/FAST.html" target="_new">see 

  website</a>) asks citizens to call or e-mail their senators and President Bush 

  on Friday, November 16th, to demand a cessation of bombing that would allow 

  neutral agencies to truck in food and medical supplies while roads are still 

  navigable. Also planned are a 24-hour solidarity fast with meditation and prayer, 

  from 1 p.m. on November 16th to 1 p.m. on November 17th, and silent vigils in 

  Boulder, Denver and Fort Collins from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on November 17th. The 

  RMPJC will hold a peaceful demonstration at Senators Allard and Campbell's offices 

  early next week to further emphasize the urgency of the crisis. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;We believe that the people of the United States, no 

  matter what their position on the war, don't want millions of people to die 

  of starvation,&quot; said Judith Molling of Boulder's RMPJC. &quot;I don't think 

  most people in this country know how dire the situation is in parts of Afghanistan,&quot; 

  added Danielle Short of Denver's American Friends Service Committee office. 

  &quot;If trucks [carrying food] can't get through within the next couple of 

  weeks, it will be too late for millions of people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Colorado volunteers have been working to share their concern 

  with schools, churches and social justice organizations across the U.S. Said 

  volunteer Mark Sweitzer &quot;It's almost Thanksgiving, and we have so much. 

  I keep thinking of how little many people in Afghanistan have to be thankful 

  for.&quot; </font></p>
