- January 18 - As thousands gather for George W. Bush's inauguration,

Billionaires for Bush and More, a coalition of the super-rich,

will come together Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C., to celebrate

their successful purchase of a president and to remind the

incoming administration of the payback they expect.

<p>To celebrate, Billionaires for Bush and More will hold their

own inaugural gala and rally Saturday at 9:30 a.m. in Dupont

Circle, outside of the north entrance to the Metro Station.

After the rally, they will begin their Donor's March to the

inaugural parade route.

<p>At the Republican and Democratic conventions in Philadelphia

and LA, the Billionaires were out in full force, holding Million

Billionaire Marches to demonstrate their influence over the

candidates. They were featured in the Washington Post, LA Times,

the BBC, Time Magazine, CNN, CBS Evening News, Fox News, and the

Associated Press.

<p>"We're thrilled to be here today to install a president who

will serve the interests of the outrageously wealthy, said

Robert Baron, co-chair of Billionaires for Bush and More. "This

election proved that people don't vote, money does!"

<p>"But we are not only in town to celebrate," added co-chair

Millie O'Nair. "The President is simply an investment, and now

it's time to cash in. We see vast opportunities for profit and

increased inequality over the next four years. We are the

Billionaires for Bush and More: more tax cuts for the rich, more

corporate welfare, more deregulation, more power!"

<p>She added, "Our first priority is to abolish the estate tax.

How can we cultivate a sense of entitlement in our children if

we can't promise them massive untaxed inheritances?"

<p>Representatives of Billionaires for Bush and More are

available for interviews. There will be many humorous photo

opportunities at the rally. More information about the

organization is available at the website,

<p><i>Billionaires for Bush and More is a non-partisan spoof

created by <a href="http://www.ufenet.org/">United for a Fair Economy</a> to draw attention to the

connection between the campaign finance system and growing

economic inequality. </i>
