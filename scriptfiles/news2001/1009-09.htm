- October 9 - On Thursday, October 18, the Worldwatch Institute will release its new study, Unnatural Disasters, by Senior Researcher, Janet Abramovitz.

James Lee Witt, former Director of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management

Agency, will join in the press briefing for this study.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More people worldwide are now displaced by natural disasters than by

conflict.  In the 1990s, natural catastrophes like hurricanes, floods,

and fires affected more than two billion people and caused in excess of

$608 billion in economic losses worldwide-a loss greater than during the

previous four decades combined.  But more and more of the devastation

wrought by such natural disasters is &quot;unnatural&quot; in origin, caused by

ecologically destructive practices and an increasing number of people

living in harm's way,  finds a new study by the Worldwatch Institute, a

Washington, D.C.-based environmental research organization. </font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By degrading forests, engineering rivers, filling in wetlands, and

destabilizing the climate, we are unraveling the strands of a complex

ecological safety net,&quot; said Janet Abramovitz , Senior Researcher and

author of  Worldwatch Paper 158, Unnatural Disasters. &quot;We have altered

so many natural systems so dramatically, their ability to protect us

from disturbances is greatly diminished.&quot;   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also contributing to the rising toll of disasters is the enormous

expansion of the human population and the built environment, which put

more people and more economic activities in harm's way. One in three

people-some 2 billion total-now live within 100 kilometers of a

coastline. Thirteen of the world's 19 megacities (with over 10 million

inhabitants) are in coastal zones.  The projected effects of global

warming, such as more extreme weather events and sea level rise, will

only magnify potential losses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">QUICK FACTS:  Worldwatch Paper 158 Unnatural Disasters</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 20th Century, 10 million people died as a result of natural

catastrophes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UN named the 1990s the International Decade for Natural Disaster

Reduction.  Instead it may go down as the Decade of Disasters:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Natural disasters in the 1990s caused over US $608 billion in economic

losses-five times the figure in the 1970s, and 15 times the total in the

1950s (p.12).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The 1990s saw 86 great disasters (major natural catastrophes requiring

outside assistance due to extensive deaths or losses).  The 1950s saw

20, the 1970s 47. (p.8)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Between 1985 and 1999 more than 560,000 people died in natural

disasters.  Only four percent were in industrial countries. (p.8) (See

also: Deaths by Region p.10 and Deaths by Disaster Type p.11)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asia has been hardest hit by natural disasters. (p.9)  Asia's tally

between 1985 and 1999:<br>

* 90 percent of all people affected by disasters  <br>

* 77 percent of deaths from disasters<br>

* 45 percent of recorded economic losses from disasters</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

COST OF DISASTERS 1985 - 1999 (Figure 4, p. 13)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Global economic losses = US $918.7 billion.<br>

Regional breakdown:<br>

Region    	 Cost (US$)     Share (%)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asia        	 $409.8 billion        45%<br>

North America    $304.4 billion         33%<br>

Europe              $112.4 billion         12%<br>

Caribbean          $30.0 billion            3%<br>

Central America  $22.3 billion           2%<br>

Oceania             $16.5 billion           2%<br>

South America    $16.4 billion           2%<br>

Africa                  $6.8 billion            1%</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Between 1985 and 1999, the world's wealthiest countries sustained 57.3

percent of the measured economic losses to disasters, representing 2.5

percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the same years the world's

poorest countries endured 24.4 percent of the economic toll of

disasters, representing 13.4 percent of their GDP (Figure 5, p.14).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

THE ADDED THREAT -- CLIMATE CHANGE</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* During the 20th century global average sea level rose by 10 - 20

centimeters.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects

that sea levels will rise another 9-88 centimeters by 2100. (p.38).

Among other impacts, some 75-200 million more people will be flooded by

storm surges each year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Projected disaster-related impacts of climate change:  See Figure 6

(p.32 Map) and Table 1 (p.39) Potential land loss and population exposed

by sea level rise in selected countries.</font></p>
