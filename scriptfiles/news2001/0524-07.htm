- May 24 - &quot;Senator Jim Jeffords&#146; decision to switch from the Republican Party to

an Independent designation bodes well for what I believe is a growing

sentiment for independent and third party efforts.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fact that the Senate is closely divided enough to make Senator

Jeffords&#146; switch significant is, in part, the result of the new

progressive voters that the Green Party attracted to the polls in the

last election.  In some states, new voters and progressive voters&#150;who

otherwise might have stayed home--came to the polls because of the

Green Party.  In the state of Washington, for example, Green Party

voters, who gave the Nader/LaDuke ticket over 100,000 votes, cast

ballots in heavy numbers for the Democratic candidate&#150;Maria Cantwell.

She defeated the incumbent Republican Senator Slade Gorton by less

than 2,400 votes (There was no Green Party Candidate for the Senate).

This was a key race in producing the 50-50 tie in the Senate which

made Senator Jeffords&#146; party switch decisive in placing control of the

Senate in the hands of the Democrats.  Now the public will be able to

see just how much lasting difference there is under the Democratic

Chairs of Senate Committees in a body that just witnessed 12

Democratic senators support President Bush&#146;s tax reduction for the

wealthy which sets the stage for future deficits and/or critical

cutbacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Similarly in other races for both the House and Senate, the Green

Party brought new voters to the polls for progressive candidates, a

fact that has been publicly noted by progressive Democrats like

Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Representative Cynthia McKinney

of Georgia.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAVVY DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING TO NADER</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By JOHN NICHOLS</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader, one of the most frequent and well?received visitors to

Madison over the past 40 years, returns tonight to deliver a

distinguished lecture at the University of Wisconsin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader arrives as the same man who spoke in Madison in the '70s, '80s,

'90s and during the 2000 presidential campaign, and he will deliver

the same message about the need for citizens to organize at the grass

roots in opposition to the threats to democracy  and liberty posed by

corporate monopolies and cowering politicians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But there is no question that Nader is now viewed differently. As the

Bush presidency unfolds, with the new president and his misguided

minions pushing the ideological envelope further and further to the

right, the anger over Nader's Green Party candidacy of last year has,

if anything, mounted. Old friends now dismiss him as &quot;arrogant&quot; and

&quot;delusional&quot; because he continues to suggest that the Democratic and

Republican parties are, at least at the upper levels, bought by the

same special interests. Local Democrats who once hailed Nader as a

visionary figure now reject him as a threat to his own achievements

or, worse yet, as a political eccentric who ought to be consigned to

the scrapheap of history.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But here's an amusing twist on the Nader bashing that is so much in

vogue this spring:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among some of the most powerful Democrats in Washington, Nader is

viewed in a far friendlier light. Yes, there is a measure of anger at

him for having maintained a candidacy that hurt Al Gore in key states.

But there is, as well, a grudging acknowledgment that Nader drew

progressive voters to the polls. Those progressive voters almost

certainly provided the narrow margins of victory for Democratic Senate

challengers Maria Cantwell in Washington state and Debbie Stabenow in

Michigan ?? giving the Democrats a 50?50 split in the Senate ?? and

for several Democratic House candidates, including San Diego's Susan

Davis and Madison's own Tammy Baldwin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps that is why genuinely progressive Democrats, such as U.S. Sen.

Russ Feingold, D?Wis., and U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney, D?Ga., have

suggested that Nader's campaign had at least some positive impact ??

most particularly when it came to mobilizing young people. As McKinney

said recently, &quot;My ability to get elected has always relied on

nontraditional people ?? bringing new</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">people, new supporters (into) the process ?? so every new voter the

Green Party attracts is a potential new voter for me. The whole idea

of progressives, I thought, was to have more people participating, not

fewer.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Nader visited Capitol Hill in February, at the invitation of Rep.

Richard Gephardt, D?Mo., the Democratic minority leader complimented

Nader for running &quot;a terrific campaign.&quot; They spoke at length about

the success of Nader's super rallies, where thousands of people ??

most of them young ?? packed arenas and paid as much as $20 to hear

Nader talk about &quot;deep democracy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nobody is paying to hear (mainstream Democrats) talk about policy,&quot;

Gephardt is reported to have told Nader. Part of the appeal, Nader

told Gephardt, was that &quot;the Greens actually have a more legitimate

platform for the old Democratic Party than the  Democratic Party

does.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gephardt ?? who disagreed with the Clinton?Gore line on trade policy,

welfare reform, farm aid and a host of other key issues ??  no doubt

agreed with that last point. As he prepares his own presidential

candidacy in 2004, Gephardt will attempt to avoid the

mistakes that Gore made in 2000 ?? the most significant of which was

the assumption that Ralph Nader would bend to the political winds of

the moment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Nader remains an uncompromising force in American public life. For

Democrats who have bent so far that they would not recognize Franklin

Delano Roosevelt, Nader looks dangerous. For Democrats such as

Gephardt, McKinney and Feingold, however, Nader poses far less of a

threat. Rather, he is a necessary reminder that Democrats can and

should pursue more progressive politics.</font></p>
