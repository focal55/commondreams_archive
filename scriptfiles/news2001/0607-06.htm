<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - June 7 - Today marked the launch of a high profile, 

          summer advertisement campaign targeting the logging behemoth Boise Cascade. 

          A full- page ad running in the <i>New York Times</i> today called on 

          the timber giant to &quot;catch up to modern values and stop destroying 

          our nation's last ancient forests.&quot; [<a href="http://www.ran.org/ran_campaigns/old_growth/BoiseCascadeAd.pdf">View 

          a PDF version of the ad.</a>]

        

<p>The national ad campaign begins as Boise Cascade finds itself under 

          increasing public scrutiny for its recent role in gutting the popular 

          U.S. Roadless Initiative as well as its efforts to log old growth forests 

          in southern Oregon against the will of local residents. The town of 

          <a href="http://www.ran.org/ran_campaigns/old_growth/news/williams_010518.html">Williams, 

          Oregon is up in arms</a> over a Boise Cascade proposal to log and use 

          herbicides in a pristine, old growth watershed. The Town Council passed 

          a unanimous resolution to buy the land from the logging company. Boise 

          Cascade has refused and is negotiating with the local Sheriff's Department 

          to provide security at the logging site. </p>

        <p>Today's advertisement, sponsored by Rainforest Action Network, draws 

          attention to the widespread public support for protecting old growth 

          forests. According to a recent Los Angeles Times poll, 9 out of 10 Americans 

          say it is important to protect wilderness areas. The ad also notes that 

          hundreds of leading companies-including Kinko's, Home Depot, and Lowe's-have 

          all responded to public concern for forests and pledged to stop selling 

          products made from endangered forests. </p>

        

<p>Despite the fact that the U.S. has already lost 95 percent of its old 

          growth forests, Boise Cascade continues to log the country's last, ancient 

          forests. In addition to the controversy in Williams, Boise Cascade has 

          also come under fire in other areas of Oregon for its old growth logging 

          in the Umpqua National Forest, home to spotted owls, eagles, falcons, 

          lynx, and wolverines. Boise Cascade also sells wood products from endangered 

          forests in South America, Southeast Asia and around the world. </p>
