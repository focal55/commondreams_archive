- April 5 - Greenpeace today gave the top 100 U.S. companies one week to

declare their opposition to President Bush's rejection of the Kyoto

Protocol, the international agreement on global warming, or face the

consequences from concerned consumers, institutions and organizations around the

world.

<P>Greenpeace wrote to the CEOs of the top 100 American companies on the newly

published <A HREF="http://www.Fortune.com" TARGET="_parent">Fortune 500 list</A>, which is now led by Exxon/Mobil.

Exxon/Mobil and other American oil and coal companies are seen globally as the

chief architects behind the Bush administration’s policy on global warming,

pushing the U.S. President to reverse his campaign promise to limit carbon

dioxide emissions from power plants, as well as to walk away from the Kyoto

Protocol.</P>



<P>"President Bush has completely broken his trust with the American people

simply to pay back his oil industry campaign contributors. It is time to

determine just which companies will choose to go down with Bush and suffer

the global outrage for undermining efforts to stop global warming," said

John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace. "Greenpeace aims to

help citizens around the world find out whose side these companies are on," he

continued.</P>



<P>The letter, <A HREF="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/features/kyotonoletter.htm" TARGET="_parent">available on-line</A>, asked the

companies:



<UL>

  

<LI> Does your company support the ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol?</li>

<br>

<br>

  

<LI> Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to this Protocol?</li>

<br>

<br>

  

<LI> Will your company support or oppose the efforts of other countries to bring the Kyoto Protocol into force without the United States?</li>

<br>

<br>

  

<LI>Does your company accept the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as the scientific basis for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and gas?</li>

<br>

</UL>

<P>"A wide range of national governments have already condemned the Bush

administration for caving in to oil, coal and gas interests and from the

deluge of mail and phone calls we’ve been receiving, we know we need to help an

outraged public," said Passacantando.</P>



<P>Greenpeace believes that the ratification and implementation of the Kyoto

Protocol is an essential, but minimal, first step toward the prevention of

dangerous climate change. The world community is aiming to get the Kyoto

Protocol ratified and in force by the Rio+10 Earth Summit in September 2002 in

Johannesburg, South Africa.
