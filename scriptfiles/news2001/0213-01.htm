- February 13 - The international environmental

organization

Greenpeace announced today that its flag ship, the SV <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>,

has

set sail from Auckland, New Zealand to the Pacific test site for the

Bush

Administration's National Missile Defense system, also known as "Star

Wars."

Greenpeace is also marking its 30th year of "raising hell to protect the

planet", with plans to challenge the Bush administration and polluting

industries across the globe to take steps to protect the environment.

<p>"The Star Wars testing program poses real and present threats to the

planet.

Greenpeace began in 1971 protesting nuclear testing and today we are

continuing our commitment to a nuclear free future by protesting the

Star

Wars project," said Greenpeace USA Executive Director John

Passacantando.

"And we'll be out in force this year to make clear our 30 year commitment

to

protecting the planet."</p>



<p>The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> is sailing to the U.S. Army Missile Testing Range at

Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands where the launch site for the so

called "kill vehicle"  - a missile intended to intercept a simulated

enemy

missile fired from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base– is located.

As

the next test of the Star Wars system is scheduled for sometime between

March and June, the <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> will be on site in the Marshall

Islands

by mid-March. Upon arrival, Greenpeace is seeking meetings with

Marshallese

leaders and the Kwajalein Missile Range commander and will hold open

boat

days to discuss the Greenpeace campaign to stop the Star Wars program

and

the threat it poses to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons with

the

people of the Marshall Islands.</p>



<p>Sending the <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> to the Star Wars test site comes in the midst

of

the Administration’s "National Security Week" and at a critical point in

deciding the future course of the system. Lead by Defense Secretary

Donald

Rumsfeld, an urgent review of the program is underway and is expected to

report to the President in late March. It also comes at a time when the

Bush

administration is engaged in a diplomatic offensive to persuade European

allies to accept its plans.</p>



<p>At a security conference in Munich two weeks ago where the German

Foreign

Minister, Joschka Fischer, warned that, "missile defense must not come

at

the expense of arms control." Other U.S. allies have also expressed

major

concern such as the French President, Jacques Chirac, who recently

cautioned

that Star Wars plans would "relaunch the arms race in the world," a

point

that is backed up the U.S. government’s own intelligence reports that

warn

both Russia and China will probably expand and modernize their nuclear

arsenals to counter a missile shield.</p>



<p>"The only thing this system will shoot down is the international nuclear

disarmament process. If Bush really wants to protect our national

security

he should scrap Star Wars now," said Passacantando.</p>



<p>In addition, to the work planned around Star Wars, in March the

Greenpeace

<i>Arctic Sunrise</i> ship will enter U.S. waters for a two-week tour of the

polluted Louisiana coastline and waterways and the organization is

gearing

up to block FDA approval of genetically engineered fish.  Efforts on

oceans,

ancient forests and global warming will also be high priority.</p>



<p>"Greenpeace is poised to make a tremendous impact on environmental

issues

within the U.S. and across the globe this year," said Passacantando. 

"We're

sending a message to the Bush administration and polluting industries

that

we're watching them and that we are prepared to take action should they

continue to threaten the environment."
