- September 4 - In what is becoming a growing threat to democratic

governance and state sovereignty, corporations are using new rights and

privileges granted under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

to challenge a variety of national, state and local policies and

decisions, a new report has found.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, &quot;NAFTA Investor-to-State Cases: Bankrupting Democracy,&quot;

documents the track record of cases brought under NAFTA's investment

chapter, which granted expansive new rights and privileges to foreign

investors operating in the three NAFTA signatory nations: Mexico, Canada

and the United States. State lawmakers joined Public Citizen in

releasing the report today in Sacramento.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since NAFTA was implemented in 1994, corporate investors in all three

countries have used these new investor rights to challenge a variety of

national, state and local policies and decisions. Corporations claim

that these governmental regulatory policies are &quot;tantamount to&quot; an

expropriation of private property and therefore they deserve

compensation from the taxpayers of the country in which they are

investing. Of the 15 cases reviewed in the report, companies have

claimed more than $13 billion in compensation for actions that many

consider to be normal regulatory activity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue is particularly timely because in the spring of 2001,

President Bush asked Congress to delegate to him six years of

constitutional authority over international trade through a process

called Fast Track.  Bush seeks Fast Track trade authority to expand

NAFTA rules to an additional 31 Latin American nations by 2005 through

the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). As a battle over Fast Track

looms in Congress, analysis of the impacts of seven years of NAFTA is

urgently needed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These nefarious provisions of NAFTA undermine the basic principles of

our federal system of government, where states are permitted to

establish their own protections for their citizens,&quot; said U.S. Rep.

George Miller (D-Martinez). &quot;Under NAFTA Chapter 11, the U.S. government

is forced to place the interests of foreign corporations over the

interests of individual states in our union.&quot;	</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study shows how a variety of government policies and actions have

been challenged by corporations as NAFTA violations, including

environmental and public health policies, a state judicial decision

upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, a jury verdict in a civil suit, a U.S.

federal procurement law and even a government's provision of postal

services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The study documents a number of extraordinary attacks on normal

government activities that are part of operating the civil justice

system or legislative work establishing environmental or public health

regulation,&quot; said California State Sen. Sheila Kuehl.  &quot;State

legislators need to be aware that under NAFTA, the U.S. could be

required to compensate any foreign corporation that feels that a state

measure is negatively impacting its investment. Protecting the interests

of the citizens of their state is a legislator's first job, not

protecting the investment rights of foreign corporations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study also found that under NAFTA, foreign corporations are granted

legal rights and privileges that are not available to U.S. companies or

citizens on U.S. soil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;U.S. law does not allow companies to seek compensation for the cost of

complying with government health and environmental regulations,&quot; said

Mike Dolan, Deputy Director, of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch.

&quot;U.S. companies can't appeal jury verdicts, state or U.S. Supreme Court

decisions to a secret trade tribunal to escape liability. There is no

U.S. law providing corporations with legal powers to attack public

services to garner a larger share of the market, but that is what

foreign corporations are doing under NAFTA.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the best-known NAFTA cases involves the state of California.

Methanex Corporation of Canada has filed a NAFTA case for $1 billion

over California's decision to phase out the gasoline additive MTBE.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Methanex company is attempting to hold taxpayers hostage to the tune of

nearly $1 billion, or 1.2 percent of our state budget, because we had

the nerve to ban a product that was contaminating water supplies all

over the state,&quot; said Martin Wagner of Earthjustice, who has attempted

to intervene in this NAFTA suit on behalf of California

environmentalists. &quot;This is not what California was promised when NAFTA

passed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other key findings include:</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Foreign Investors Granted Greater Rights Than U.S. Corporations or U.S.

Citizens:</b> The cases analyzed in this report show how NAFTA's investor

protections are being used by foreign investors to demand payment not

for &quot;expropriations&quot; or seizure of property, but more commonly for any

government action that impacts an investor's expected future profits.

Yet this notion of &quot;regulatory takings&quot; does not exist in U.S. law.

Given that it would eviscerate basic government policymaking, it has

been rejected by Congress and the courts. Attempts to legislate a

broader definition of property rights through regulatory takings

legislation has been repeatedly rejected by Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Private Corporate Enforcement of NAFTA Privileges:</b> NAFTA provides

foreign investors the ability to privately enforce the new rights and

privileges granted by NAFTA in trade tribunals. Called

&quot;investor-to-state&quot; dispute resolution, this extraordinary mechanism

empowers private investors and corporations to sue NAFTA signatory

governments for an unlimited amount of taxpayer dollars, behind closed

doors and outside the nation's judicial system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Foreign Investors Could Evade Legal Liability:</b> NAFTA's investor-to-state

tribunals provide an avenue for foreign litigants to escape liability

and seek government compensation for damages ordered by U.S. courts. One

Canadian corporation is seeking $725 million from U.S. taxpayers because

of an adverse jury verdict in a private breach-of-contract case in a

Mississippi court. This special right of &quot;appeal&quot; is a privilege enjoyed

only by foreign investors; domestic companies must abide by the

decisions of domestic courts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Principle of Sovereign Immunity Attacked:</b> In addition to the

implications for state sovereignty when governmental decisions are

second-guessed and undermined by NAFTA panels, the long-standing common

law legal principle of sovereign immunity itself has been attacked in a

NAFTA case. A Canadian corporation involved in a contract dispute with

the city of Boston is challenging a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling

(upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court) that the city agency involved in the

dispute was immune from liability due to sovereign immunity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chilling Effect on Public Interest Policy:</b>  In the first NAFTA corporate

case, the U.S. Ethyl corporation filed a suit challenging a Canadian

environmental and public health measure restricting a gasoline additive

it developed as the ban was being debated in parliament.  The Canadian

government caved into pressure, revoked its law and compensated the

corporation $13 million, demonstrating that the potential to bully even

governments of wealthy developed countries under Chapter 11 is enormous.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<b>NAFTA Environmental Protections Meaningless:</b>  In the NAFTA corporate

investor challenges decided to date, NAFTA text language purporting to

protect the environment has been given such short shrift by NAFTA

tribunals as to render these so-called protections meaningless. In one

case involving the construction of a toxic waste treatment facility in

Mexico, the environmental and health concerns of the community were

given little to no consideration by the NAFTA tribunal that ruled in the

company's favor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Governments Subject to Endless Second-Guessing by NAFTA Tribunals:</b> A

tribunal in one case found that Canada's temporary ban of PCB exports

based on environmental concerns was reasonable. However, the tribunal

also ruled that Canada's actions were a NAFTA violation and the company

deserved compensation because the manner in which Canada sought to

implement its environmental goal was not in the least trade restrictive

manner possible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Potential Cost to the Taxpayers in the Billions:</b> In the end, it is the

taxpayers of the challenged country who must pay the compensation to a

corporation if it succeeds in its NAFTA suit. In the first seven years

of NAFTA, with only a small number of cases filed, an astonishing $13

billion has been claimed by corporations in their initial filings: $1.8

billion from U.S. taxpayers, $294 million from Mexican taxpayers and a

whopping $11.3 billion from Canadian taxpayers.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>From Defense to Offense:</b> Although the NAFTA provisions on expropriation

or actions &quot;tantamount to&quot; expropriation were originally supposed to

protect investors against nationalization or state seizure of property,

a number of corporations using NAFTA's private enforcement are not

attempting to claim expropriation of their property when initiating

NAFTA Chapter 11 cases. Rather, they are relying on other provisions of

NAFTA to bring a private trade case in an effort to improve their

strategic position in the marketplace.</font></p>
