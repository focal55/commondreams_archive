- January 25 - As part of the effort to ensure that globalization

includes protections of human rights and the environment, the Sierra Club

and Amnesty International USA are bringing 200 students from around the

country to Washington, DC to participate in workshops and meet with their

members of Congress.   The Youth Summit on Globalization will culminate

with a rally at the U.S. Capitol on Monday morning before the students go

to meetings with their representatives.

<p>

In the past year, there have been several protests regarding the threats

that unrestrained free trade can have on the environment and human rights.

The Youth Summit on Globalization aims to focus the energy of this movement

and give youth the tools they need to really go about making change.

<p>

<p>

WHAT:  Rally at the US Capitol to wrap up Youth Summit with students from

around the country.

<p>

WHO:    Speakers from Amnesty International and Sierra Club and 200 student

activists

<p>

WHEN:    10:30 AM

       Monday, January 29, 2001

<p>

WHERE: House Triangle, southeast corner of the U.S. Capitol building

<p>

Beginning Friday, January 26, the students will meet at the joint Sierra

Club/Amnesty International Youth Summit in Washington, DC to plan the

defense of the environment and environmental defenders in the face of

globalization.

<p>

As governments worldwide continue to negotiate trade agreements that ignore

environmental and human rights concerns and set their foreign policy in

line with the dictates of global corporations rather than human values, the

Youth Summit will help build the movement to protect human rights and the

environment.

<p>

The full youth summit will be taking place January 26-29 at the National

4-H Center, 7100 Connecticut Avenue, Chevy Chase, Maryland.  For more

information, call David Willett at 202-675-6698 or Alistair Hodgett at

202-544-0200.
