<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 22 - A dissatisfied former customer of a California company that

specializes in cosmetic surgery for baldness has a right to set up a Web site critical of

the company and use the company&#146;s name in his domain name, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/bosley.htm" target="_new">Public Citizen has told a

federal court</a>.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Michael Kremer, a self-employed resident of California, set up the site after becoming

dissatisfied with hair restoration services he paid Bosley Medical to provide to him in

1991. Kremer had seen several accounts in the media regarding other complaints about

Bosley, including a piece on &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and an article in U.S. News and

World Report, and based the information on his site on these and other accounts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Jan. 7, 2000, Kremer registered a Web address, &quot;<a href="http://www.bosleymedical.com" target="_new">www.bosleymedical.com</a>,&quot; then wrote to the

company, notifying them of his plans and giving them the opportunity to make any

objections in advance. The only response from the company was a complaint for arbitration

filed with World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a group in Switzerland that is

typically favorable to companies when ruling on Internet trademark issues. Meanwhile,

Kremer refrained from posting any material on his site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the WIPO arbitrator ruled in Kremer&#146;s favor and reprimanded Bosley for

attempting to stifle critical speech, Kremer registered the domain name &quot;<a href="http://www.bosleymedicalviolations.com" target="_new">www.bosleymedicalviolations.com</a>,&quot;

on which he posted complaints against the company. He registered a second domain name

because he had experienced technical difficulties using the first name. Both sites are now

functional.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the arbitration, the company filed suit against Kremer in the United States

District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, accusing him of libel and trademark

infringement. The company has asked the federal court to force Kremer to take down both

his Web sites and remove all commentary critical of the company. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bosley Medical&#146;s intent is clear in this case. It wants to stifle critical

consumer commentary,&quot; said Paul Alan Levy, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation

Group, who represents Kremer. &quot;Bosley&#146;s lawsuit amounts to cyber-bullying, an

attempt to intimidate Mr. Kremer into silencing himself.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Kremer&#146;s affidavit indicates, Bosley has never denied the factual accuracy of

the media and law enforcement reports upon which Kremer based his Web sites. Further, the

company has been disciplined in the past for a variety of practices. It was fined $644,724

in 1996 over its medical and advertising practices, and its medical license was suspended

then placed on probation for five years<b> </b>by the California medical board in 1999.

Bosley also has faced discipline charges in 20 other states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Bosley asserts that Kremer&#146;s sites represent a trademark infringement,

Levy says that Kremer&#146;s sites are purely informational and that Kremer receives no

income from them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These sites are constructed and worded in a way that no visitor could possibly

mistake them as Bosley&#146;s own,&quot; Levy added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen, which has long had an interest in free speech issues on the Internet,

agreed to intervene in the case on Kremer&#146;s behalf and today filed a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/bosley.htm" target="_new">motion to dismiss the suit</a>.

&nbsp; The group has previously been involved with several other cases involving the First

Amendment and the Internet, including one involving critics of the corporate takeover in

Pacifica Radio in May.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Lawsuits should not be used as intimidation tactics to chill free speech on the

Internet,&quot; Levy said. &quot;It seems that recent court precedent hasn&#146;t taught

companies the lesson that if they bring these lawsuits, they will lose.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.citizen.org/press/bosleysites.htm" target="_new">Bosley Medical operates</a> in Arizona, California, Colorado,

Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,

Missouri, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,

Texas, Tennessee, Washington, and the District of Columbia</font></p>
