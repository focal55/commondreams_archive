- January 16 - World Wildlife Fund (WWF) today condemned an unexpected decision by the Norwegian Government to re-open international trade in whale products in defiance of a global whaling moratorium. The decision allows Norway to resume export of an unlimited amount of meat and blubber from minke whales, to Japan, Iceland, Peru and other nations.

<P>

Norway's decision was condemned by World Wildlife Fund as damaging to Norway's reputation as an environmentally friendly nation and as a move that could provoke the collapse of global protections for all whales. "Norway's reckless bid to re-open trade in whale products puts international protections for all whale species at risk," said Richard N. Mott, vice president at WWF.

<P>

Norway's change in policy was announced this afternoon jointly by representatives of its fisheries and foreign ministries. While observers viewed the decision as a domestic political move by the ruling Labor Party to reposition itself in advance of elections later this year, the timing of the announcement also raised questions of a link to the U.S. presidential transition.

<P>

Norway has had an understanding with the Clinton administration since 1993 under which the U.S. would not act to punish Norwegian coastal whaling if sales of the meat were restricted to domestic markets. Norway's decision today suggests it believes it has less to fear from the incoming Bush administration.

<P>

WWF called on President-elect George W. Bush to hold the line on whaling. "The incoming Bush administration should make it clear that U.S. opposition to commercial whaling has not wavered. Norway, and other aspiring whaling nations, must not misinterpret the U.S. election as a license to do whatever they want on whaling." Mott said.

<P>

A global moratorium on commercial whaling has been in force since 1986, negotiated by the International Whaling Commission, the sole body authorized to manage the great whales. Whales are also protected under the 1972 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which forbids international trade in whale products. Norway, a CITES member, tried unsuccessfully last April to lift trade restrictions on minke whales but was defeated by larger than expected margins.

<P>

"Having tried and failed to weaken international protections for whales, Norway has now chosen to ignore them altogether," said Mott.

<P>

Annually, Norway has hunted minke whales in the North Atlantic using a "self-awarded" quota. In 1999, for example, Norway set the quota at 753 minke whales, then the highest number since the moratorium on commercial whaling came into force in 1986. Norwegian domestic demand for whale meat is modest; the real prospect of high profits for Norway's whalers lies in re-opening trade with Japan, by far the world's largest consumer of cetacean products.

<P>

Norway's decision today adds to the growing list of threats to the whale during the last six months. In July last year, Japan escalated its whaling activities, expanding its annual "scientific" hunt of 450 minke whales to include two new species - an additional 50 Bryde's and 10 sperm whales. Japan's action came just three weeks after the annual meeting the International Whaling Commission (IWC).
