- July 12 - The Bush Administration's announcement today that it will rush ahead with

deployment of a missile defense system and expects to violate the 1972 ABM

Treaty within months was met with skepticism and scorn by the Council for a

Livable World, the oldest and most established arms control organization.



	<p>"This plan flunks the smell test in any number of ways," said John Isaacs,

president of the Council. "First, they are rushing to failure. There is no

missile defense system even close to being ready to deploy.  Second, it's a

huge blunder to walk away from the ABM Treaty.  Third, this is a political

gambit rather than a military plan."



	<p>The missile defense system the administration hopes to deploy failed its

last two tests. Another test takes place Saturday. "According to the

Pentagon's own schedule, they must conduct 17 more tests of the land-based

system.  There is no reason to deploy a system until it has proven

consistently effective in real-world conditions," Isaacs said.



	<p>The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of the arms control regime that has been

in place since the Nixon Administration. "If we abrogate the treaty, we are

abdicating our leadership on nuclear weapons policy and giving the green

light for a new arms race," said Chris Madison, director of the missile

defense campaign at the Council for a Livable World Education Fund. "The

treaty is not a relic, it is a legal obligation we should not abandon

lightly. No one but the Bush Administration believes this is the right road

to go down now."



	<p>Isaacs suggested the Administration was opting for unilateralism once

again, despite its rhetoric about consulting with other countries.  "The

Administration's list of unilateral steps gets longer:  They have backed

out of the Kyoto Global Warming agreement, refused to ratify the

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, cut nuclear non-proliferation funding,

opposed the U.N. draft accord on the international sale of small arms,

opted out of the International Court of Justice and now will abrogate the

ABM Treaty.



	<p>"The administration seems intent on going it alone internationally and

fortifying its conservative base at home.



<p>"There is no reason to rush the deployment of missile defense. We should

continue testing as long as necessary, and meanwhile take other steps to

reduce the danger from nuclear weapons. We should talk to the Russians

about reducing our weapons stockpiles, not about violating the ABM treaty.

We should talk to the Koreans about ending their missile program, not

rushing to build a system to shoot down their missiles."
