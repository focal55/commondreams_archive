- June 14 - While US President George W. Bush meets European Union leaders in Gothenburg to discuss the Kyoto protocol, 15 Greenpeace activists protested the arrival of the super tanker &quot;Patris&quot;, which is loading Norwegian oil for export to the United States. Greenpeace demands that both Norway and the EU make it clear to Bush that they will ratify the Kyoto Protocol with or without him, and that no other alternatives will be accepted. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Norway must support the Kyoto Protocol, together with the rest of Europe. Oil exports to the US, which is trying to wreck Kyoto, only undermines Norwegian policy. Kyoto must be ratified and enter into force before 2002, with or without Bush&quot;, said Truls Gulowsen, Greenpeace campaigner. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Greek tanker &quot;Patris&quot; is on its way to the Norwegian oil company Statoil's oil terminal at Mongstad, Norway, and will take on 300,000 tonnes of oil bound for the USA. The tanker was met by five Greenpeace inflatables with banners saying &quot;Stop Bush - Ratify Kyoto&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norway is currently the eighth largest oil exporter to the US. Norwegian exports in February amounted to more than 355 thousand barrels a day, or one tanker the size of the &quot;Patris&quot; per week. The Norwegian state-owned Statoil, soon to be privatised, supplies ten percent of the oil consumed on the US east coast. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Though it is a first small step towards safeguarding the Earth's climate, the Kyoto Protocol, is the ONLY global legal instrument available to start tackling the problem. Oil exports to the US will only lead to continued unregulated CO2 emissions by the US, a country which is trying to destroy the Kyoto Protocol&quot;, said Gulowsen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, twenty activists occupied oil tanker &quot;Cosmic&quot; for ten hours, preventing it from leaving the Mongstad oil terminal. The tanker was loaded with 150,000 tonnes of crude oil was also bound for the US. This followed Sunday's action where Greenpeace activists occupied a tanker carrying US oil into Le Havre, France. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This action is part of Greenpeace's global campaign to pressure corporate America and George W Bush to work with the rest of the world to save the climate.</font></p>
