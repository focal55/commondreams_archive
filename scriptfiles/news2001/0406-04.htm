- April 6 - The Green Party endorses a mass

rally and march in support of Palestinian refugee

rights to be held in NYC on Saturday, April 7. By

co-sponsoring this event, the Green Party reaffirms

its unwavering commitment to human rights and the

observance of international law as the basis for a

just and enduring peace between Israelis and

Palestinians. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Association of State Green Parties (ASGP)

Steering Committee co-chair, Tom Sevigny of CT, &quot;Our

support for the Palestinian right to return to their

homes is consistent with the Green Party's view that

impartial respect for human rights is the foundation

of emerging democracies and peaceful international

relations. Since 1948, Palestinian refugees have been

denied their inalienable right to return to their

native land while non-native Jews continue to

immigrate to the same land under the Israeli 'Law of

Return.' This double standard constitutes an ongoing

violation of human rights as guaranteed by

international law including Article 13 of the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Geneva

Conventions, and UN General Assembly Resolution 194.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While recognizing that the right to return home is

inalienable, the Greens also emphasize that feasible

solutions have been proposed that would allow

Palestinians to act on their right without appreciable

dislocation of current Jewish residents within Israel.

Mr. Sevigny said, &quot;Honoring this human right is a

matter of political will of the international community, especially the US which provides Israel

with billions of dollars in aid annually.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The long-standing plight of Palestinian refugees

resonates with the more recent experience of refugees

and internally displaced persons whose numbers have

grown as a result of the proliferation of ethnic

conflict worldwide in places like Kosovo, Rwanda, and

East Timor. As ASGP International Committee member,

Justine McCabe, said, &quot;The Green Party calls attention

to the fact that in the absence of uniform protections for refugee rights, including the right to return

home, the possibility for non-violent conflict

resolution and the promotion of peace greatly

diminishes.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The upcoming rally in NYC has been organized by

Al-Awda, the Palestinian Right of Return Coalition. It

is a repeat of events held in September, 2000, in

which thousands rallied in Washington, D.C., London

and Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied territories. In endorsing this event,

the Green Party is joined by over 100 peace and human

rights organizations such as Amnesty International,

Global Exchange, and Jews Against the Occupation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party continues to be the only American

political party to unequivocally support Palestinian

human rights including the right to repatriation and

restitution as the unconditional premise on which

peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians must be based. </font></p>
