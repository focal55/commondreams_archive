- April 24 - Today at a news conference called by the Coalition Against Religious Discrimination, the Rev. Arnold Howard joined religious leaders from across the country and the theological spectrum in voicing opposition to the Bush administration’s plan to fund religion with tax dollars. Rev. Howard, who called the plan "bad for government, and worse for religion," is vice chair of People For the American Way Foundation’s African American Ministers Leadership Council and the pastor of Enon Baptist Church in Baltimore.

    <P>

      At the news conference, a petition to the president and Congress bearing the signatures of hundreds of faith leaders opposing the administration’s plan was unveiled. Rev. Howard commented that African Americans have a particular interest in opposing government’s funding of religion, because such a plan "would weaken the African American church’s voice and moral power as a force for social justice." Citing the African American churches’ historic role, Rev. Howard added, "When we go to the government, it must not be with our hands out, but with our heads high and our voices unrestrained."

    </P>

    <P>

      Agreeing with the concerns of the nearly one thousand colleagues of his who signed the petition, Rev. Howard said the petition’s claim that "injecting dollars and bureaucratic oversight directly into houses of worship" would pose "numerous dangers to both religion and government" was on the mark. "The lure of money is not worth the loss of our independence and our history," he said.

    </P>

    <P>

      Rev. Howard also criticized the proposal for fostering an unhealthy competition between religions and between secular and religiously affiliated social service providers. "With no new money to provide social services," he said, "a battle for scarce resources would ensue." He also stated his concern "that some politically unpopular faiths would not receive funds, no matter how good their programs are."

    </P>

    <P>

      "If people of faith are to make a difference in this society, let us do it with our voice strong, and with our integrity uncompromised by a government that is not always on our side," he concluded.
