Author of <I>Volunteer Slavery: My Authentic Negro

Experience</I> and a columnist for MSNBC, Nelson said today: "What we

can do is demand leadership. Not the leadership of politicians angling for pet

projects like missile defense shields or casting about for somewhere to lay the

blame and someone to wage war upon. We certainly don't need the leadership of

America's corporations and Oiltocracy, the defense contractors who stand to

profit from military activity or the independent profiteers who are

capitalizing on our fears by gouging gas prices. It's up to the American people

to take the high road and demand that our leaders join us. Revenge will not

resolve the magnitude of this tragedy. Nothing does. We owe the dead and those

who mourn them the tribute of our true, loving, compassionate selves, not the

violent and vengeful other.

Author of the international bestseller <I>No Logo: Taking

Aim at the Brand Bullies</I> -- called "a movement bible" by the

<I>New York Times</I> -- and a leading voice against corporate globalization, Klein

said today: "Americans don't get daily coverage on CNN of the ongoing

bombings in Iraq, nor are they treated to human-interest stories on the

devastating effects of economic sanctions on that country's children. After the

1998 bombing of a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan (apparently mistaken for a

chemical weapons facility) there weren't too many follow-up reports about what

the loss of vaccine manufacturing did to disease prevention. When NATO bombed

civilian targets in Yugoslavia -- including markets, hospitals, refugee

convoys, passenger trains, and a TV station -- major media didn't do 'streeter'

interviews with survivors about how shocked they were by the indiscriminate

destruction. The U.S. has become expert in the art of sanitizing and

dehumanizing acts of war committed elsewhere. This is one of the country's many

paradoxes: though the engine of globalization around the world, the nation has

never been more inward looking, less worldly. The U.S. is a country that

believed itself not just at peace but war-proof, a self-perception that would

come as quite a surprise to most Iraqis, Palestinians and Colombians. The era

of the video game war in which the U.S. is always at the controls has produced

a blinding rage in many parts of the world, a rage at the persistent asymmetry

of suffering. This is the context in which twisted revenge seekers make no

other demand than that American citizens share their pain."

Niva, who wrote the article "Between Clash and

Cooptation: U.S. Foreign Policy and Islamic Movements," is professor of

international politics at Evergreen State College in Washington and an

associate with the Middle East Research and Information Project. He said today:

"The present U.S. strategy for ending the threat of terrorism through the

use of military force will only exacerbate the problem. Terrorism is a

phenomenon that can be defeated only by amelioration of the conditions that

inspire it. These attacks have been attributed to Islamic radicals based in the

Middle East and Central Asia. While only a fringe element has seized upon

violence as their solution, many of the world's 1.2 billion Muslim people are

understandably aggrieved by double standards. When innocent U.S. citizens are

killed or harmed the U.S. government expects expressions of outrage and grief

over brutal terrorism. But when U.S. cruise missiles kill and maim innocent

Iraqis, Sudanese, Afghanis, and Pakistanis, the U.S. calls it 'collateral

damage.'"
