- November 14 - Mounting evidence of a 

global network of sophisticated terrorists combined with potential 

black markets in plutonium, highly enriched uranium, and 

radioactive wastes boosts the likelihood of nuclear terrorism, 

according to <a href="http://www.ippnw.org/" target="_new">International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear 

War</a> (IPPNW). Speaking at a National Press Club news briefing, 

leaders of IPPNW and its U.S. affiliate Physicians for Social 

Responsibility (PSR), along with other experts, described four 

types of terrorist threats: crude nuclear weapons; radiological 

dispersion weapons; weapons bought or stolen from a nuclear state; 

and attacks on nuclear power plants or weapons production 

facilities. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An IPPNW book, &quot;Crude Nuclear Weapons: Proliferation and the 

Terrorist Threat,&quot; circulated at the briefing, concludes that a 

determined terrorist group could fabricate a simple nuclear device 

with 28 pounds of highly enriched uranium or as little as 18 pounds 

of plutonium. The breakup of the former Soviet Union and the 

proliferation of nuclear technology have made these materials more 

accessible, removing one of the greatest obstacles to terrorists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using the methodology contained in the study, IPPNW Co-President 

Mary-Wynne Ashford, M.D., said, &quot;If terrorists had attacked New 

York City with a Hiroshima-sized crude nuclear weapon, between 

60,000 and 300,000 people would have been killed, depending on the 

location of the explosion and time of day. Other effects would be 

devastating: panic would ensue; evacuations would be necessary; and 

ambulance, hospital and other medical services would be overwhelmed 

by the numbers of people with burns, injuries, and shock.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From a technical perspective, a radiological dispersion weapon 

would be the simplest nuclear device for terrorists to make and 

use. Such a weapon could spread plutonium or other radioactive 

materials over cities without a nuclear explosion. Bruce Blair, 

Ph.D., president of the Center for Defense Information (CDI), 

estimated that a casket-sized radiation dispersal weapon loaded 

with spent fuel from a nuclear power plant and detonated in New 

York City would cause 2,000 immediate deaths and injure thousands 

more. U.S. medical facilities are ill equipped to manage a large 

number of radiation-related casualties. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new PSR report, &quot;Projected U.S. Casualties and Destruction of 

U.S. Medical Services from Attacks by Russian Nuclear Forces,&quot; 

released at the briefing, demonstrates that there is no effective 

medical response to nuclear war. The report describes the medical 

impact of a nuclear confrontation between the U.S. and Russia at 

current force levels and if Russian strategic warheads are cut to 

around 500. Warhead retargetting by Russia to avoid proposed U.S. 

missile defenses could lead to far higher casualties. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ira Helfand, M.D., of PSR explained, &quot;This important medical 

study shows that no preparations could help the U.S. survive a 

nuclear attack, by accident or design. Presidents Bush and Putin 

need to go much further to make us safe from this ultimate 

catastrophe.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The physicians' groups believe that the Bush Administration has 

a responsibility to fully fund programs that can reduce and 

eliminate the threat posed by tons of inadequately safeguarded 

highly enriched uranium and plutonium that could be fashioned into 

instruments of nuclear terrorism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., chief executive officer of PSR, said, 

&quot;The threat of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation hangs 

over us all. We must invest far more in containing nuclear 

materials safely and in preventing the spread of these dreadful 

weapons. Disarmament is the only cure for this final epidemic.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jonathan Schell, author of &quot;The Fate of the Earth and the 

just-published book The Unfinished 20th Century,&quot; called on the 

United States to lead the international community in renouncing the 

use and threat of use of nuclear and other weapons of mass 

destruction. He urged the nuclear weapons states to begin 

negotiations on a treaty that will ban nuclear weapons. &quot;Unless we 

abolish nuclear weapons, the threat of nuclear annihilation will 

always loom over us,&quot; Schell concluded. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the speakers urged the Bush-Putin summit to address the 

overwhelming threat of nuclear weapons use, the strategic dangers 

of deploying a national missile defense (NMD), and the need for 

strict measures to reduce the risk of terrorist use of nuclear 

materials. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If our cities are to survive the 21st century, governments 

throughout the world must unite in an urgent global campaign to 

establish the tightest possible international control over all 

weapons-usable fissile materials,&quot; said Dr. Ashford. &quot;Unless 

radical steps are taken immediately, it will not be a question of 

whether terrorists can acquire or build a nuclear device, but 

when.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IPPNW, which was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1985, is 

a global federation of medical organizations in more than 60 

countries dedicated to research, education and advocacy relevant to 

the prevention of nuclear war. PSR is the U.S. affiliate of the 

federation. </font></p>
