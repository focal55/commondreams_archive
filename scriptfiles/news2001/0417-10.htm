- April 17 - ExxonMobil is going on the defensive today with a spate of editorials defending the company's position on global warming. The company's response appears to be the result of calls by Green parties worldwide for a boycott of the company as well as efforts by its own shareholders to make the company take responsibility for its role in global warming. Most of the company's revenue comes from overseas where many boycott supporters are potent political forces. The company's 2000 annual report states it earned $10.2 billion from overseas sales, while it earned $6.8 in the US. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, April 16th, participants at the Global Greens 2000 conference formally resolved to boycott ExxonMobil and other US corporations for their resistance to the Kyoto Protocol. The Protocol sets binding emissions reduction targets and was signed by 160 nations in 1997. Environmentalists view the US companies as instrumental in convincing President George W. Bush to abandon the protocol.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Investors ought to be concerned that ExxonMobil has positioned itself as the most important global environmental target on what many people see as the most important global environmental issue,&quot; said Peter Altman of Campaign ExxonMobil. Campaign ExxonMobil is a US based coalition of religious and environmental groups that has been working to convince ExxonMobil to take responsibility for global warming. &quot;Even a small change in buying habits could translate into tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil acknowledged its concerns about the boycott when it announced yesterday that it would launch a public relations blitz with advertisements placed in Tuesday's New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post.<br>

 <br>

The boycott efforts may give new leverage to Campaign ExxonMobil's efforts to change the company from the inside. The group is building support for two shareholder resolutions which call on the company to make a commitment to develop renewable energy and make it more responsive to environmental issues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This year's shareholder resolutions give investors a way to turn down the heat on ExxonMobil; they give investors a choice between losing money to a boycott or investing money in solutions,&quot; said Altman. Institutional investors that have difficulty accommodating the long-term concerns about global warming are more likely to recognize the short-term impacts a global boycott could have.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign ExxonMobil recently published investor briefings discussing the short and long-term arguments in favor of the two environmental resolutions. The briefings can be found at <a href="http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org">www.campaignexxonmobil.org</a>.<br>
