- July 19 - &quot;The Bush Administration is presently promoting its energy plan at public meetings across the nation, but its efforts are only 

compounding fears that the Administration will sacrifice the 

environment to energy-industry profits,&quot; said National Parks 

Conservation Association President Thomas Kiernan. &quot;One sign of 

this was Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton's recent appearance 

before the House Resources Committee, during which she said that 

the President proposes to apply the federal share of revenues from 

oil development at the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to promote 

renewable energy technology and to improve national parks and 

public lands. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has been 

leading the charge to increase funding for national parks. NPCA 

has worked with the National Park Service through its Business Plan 

Initiative to put national parks on a sound financial footing. 

NPCA also has developed a program to win stronger funding for 

national park upkeep and protection. But we do not support any 

plan that involves diminishing the public's pristine wild lands, 

like the Arctic refuge, in order to fund parks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The idea of molesting the Arctic refuge to fund protection of 

national parks and other public lands is a cynical ploy advanced by 

the Administration to split the environmental community, but we 

aren't falling for it. If the Bush Administration persists in this 

approach to park protection, the 'D' grade we recently gave the 

Administration for its national parks policies will slip even 

lower.&quot; </font></p>
