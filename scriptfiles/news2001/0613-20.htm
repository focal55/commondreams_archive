- June 13 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: <br>

Global-AIDS-Alliance, ACT UP, Jubilee USA Network, African 

Services Committee, the Health GAP Coalition, American Jewish World 

Service, Africa Action, and in cooperation with allies in the 

Global South. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of concerned people of conscience including AIDS 

activists, faith-based organizations, economic justice advocates, 

students, religious activists, health professionals, local African 

American congregations, working families and their unions, political leaders and others active in calling for action on global 

AIDS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN and WHERE: <br>

11 a.m. on Saturday, June 23, 2001. Marchers will gather at 

Washington Square Park, Manhattan and march (Noon) to Bryant Park 

for the Rally (1:30 - 3 p.m.) which will include music and 

speakers. Additional marchers will join the march beginning at GMHC 

on 24th Street, a halfway point for those who cannot walk the 

entire march route. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: <br>

A mass march and rally as part of A Global Day of Action under 

the theme, &quot;Stop Global AIDS Now!&quot; to demand action from the U.S. 

government and other wealthy nations. Organizers are calling for 

a peaceful, legal assembly without violence to people or property. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Rally speakers will include people living with HIV and 

activists from grassroots movements in the Global South issuing 

calls to action, from: South Africa, Thailand, Brazil, Nigeria, and 

the United States. Other speakers will be available for a press

conference including HIV/AIDS experts and activists from Kenya, 

Uganda and U.S.-based Africa policy and debt cancellation 

advocates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY: <br>

Marchers are responding to the upcoming UN General Assembly 

Special Session on HIV/AIDS (June 25-27) and the Group of Eight 

Summit in Genoa, Italy (July 20-23, 2001). With HIV transmission 

increasing exponentially, 13 million orphans and with over 30 

million people facing death from untreated HIV/AIDS, the richest 

countries must increase direct grant aid and implement complete 

debt cancellation for impoverished countries to support an expanded 

and comprehensive response. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demands:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States Government and economically-advantaged 

Group of Seven (G7) governments invest billions in grants to the 

Global AIDS Fund, to national AIDS plans, and to social 

infrastructure in impoverished countries.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States Government and the Group of Seven (G7) 

governments use their influence and voting power to call on the IMF 

and the World Bank to use their own resources to implement full 

cancellation of debts owed to them by all impoverished countries 

heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wealthy countries invest in treatment access strategies and 

health care infrastructure, including vaccine distribution systems. 

These strategies include parallel importing, generic production, 

and a system of global bulk drug procurement. </font></li>
