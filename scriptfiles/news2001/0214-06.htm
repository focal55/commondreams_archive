- February 14 - Senators Paul Wellstone (D-MN), Tim Hutchinson (R-AR),

Robert Torricelli (D-NJ),  Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms

(R-NC), Mark Dayton (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Robert Smith (R-NH) today

introduced a Senate resolution calling on the U.S. government to sponsor a

resolution to censure China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission

meeting in Geneva next month.  A companion resolution was also introduced in the

House of Representatives today.   At a  bipartisan press conference to announce

the campaign to promote the U.S. resolution, members of the House and Senate

emphasized that China&#146;s dismal record in the area of human rights deserves

international scrutiny. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Bush Administration is now considering whether to propose a resolution at

Geneva condemning China&#146;s human rights abuses.  We strongly urge it to do so,

and to work vigorously to enlist world support for the resolution.  A firm

statement from the Senate and the House will help the Administration to

establish human rights as a key priority in our international diplomacy and to

continue America&#146;s record of leadership at the U.N. Human Rights Commission,&#148;

said Wellstone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations Human Rights Commission, which meets annually in Geneva, is

the only international body responsible for monitoring and reporting on the

human rights conditions of all states.   Resolutions offered at the Commission

both highlight human rights violations and pressure governments to correct them.

 

 

&#147;China continues to crack down on any perceived threats to the Communist Party,

and  Chinese authorities have stepped up deplorable human rights abuses, 

attacking pro-democracy activists, ethnic minority groups, labor activists, and

others attempting to exercise free expression.  Minority religious groups

particularly have been targeted of late, with Chinese authorities destroying

places of worship and incarcerating people of faith.  The United States cannot

be silent, but must lead international condemnation of China&#146;s terrible abuse of

its citizens&#146; fundamental human rights,&#148; said Wellstone.
