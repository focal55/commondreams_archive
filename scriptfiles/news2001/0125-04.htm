- January 25 - The World Trade Organization has indicated that it will hold its next ministerial meeting at the beginning of November in Qatar. This has prompted objections from human rights groups and critics of the WTO 

concerned that Qatar will not allow protests. The WTO is expected to make 

its official selection within the next two weeks. The following people are 

available for comment:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">JOE STORK, <a href="mailto:storkj@hrw.org">storkj@hrw.org</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">http://www.hrw.org</a><br>

Washington director of the Middle East/North Africa Division of Human 

Rights Watch, Stork said today: &quot;Either Qatar must pledge that free 

assembly will be respected or the WTO ministers should find another 

location. Qatar's human rights record is blemished. Although the 

free-wheeling al-Jazeera satellite television station is based in Qatar, the government restricts freedom of assembly. Increasing public concern 

about the WTO's failure to incorporate respect for human rights, labor 

rights, the environment, and globalization's impact on the poor culminated 

in large-scale protests during the last ministerial meetings in Seattle in 

November 1999. Subsequent protests occurred at the spring and annual 

meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund that were held 

in Washington, D.C., and Prague, respectively.... WTO head Michael Moore 

has said that non-governmental organizations previously accredited by the WTO would have access to Qatar, although he made no pledge about the right 

to peaceful assembly.&quot;</font></p>

Co-author of &quot;Globalize This! The Battle Against the World Trade 

Organization and Corporate Rule,&quot; Danaher said today: &quot;The unity in the 

streets in Seattle created such disunity inside the WTO that they have yet 

to mend the cracks in their edifice. It is indicative of how beleaguered 

the WTO is and how anti-democratic their instincts are that the WTO is 

reduced to considering a place chosen for its political inaccessibility. Still, the WTO shouldn't think that this will prevent dissent.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAVID WASKOW, <a href="mailto:dwaskow@foe.org">dwaskow@foe.org</a>, <a href="http://www.foe.org">http://www.foe.org</a><br>

Trade and international policy coordinator for Friends of the Earth, Waskow 

said today: &quot;The WTO should not try to avoid public scrutiny simply by 

holding a meeting in a country that forbids public protest. Rather, such a 

move would simply send a clear message that current criticisms of the WTO's 

anti-democratic processes are if anything understated. Scheduling a WTO 

Ministerial in Qatar would be contrary to the WTO's stated plans to build 

public understanding and support for the WTO.&quot;</font></p>
