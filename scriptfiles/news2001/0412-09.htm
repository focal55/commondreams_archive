- April 12 - The Human Rights Campaign today decried a push by extreme, right-wing religious political groups to pressure the Bush administration to drop Scott H. Evertz as its selection to direct the Office of National AIDS Policy. The attacks underline the groups&#146; intentions to promote discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans, says HRC.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These far right religious political groups have sent a clear message that a person&#146;s sexual orientation ought to be a disqualifying factor in employment,&#148; said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. &#147;A person ought to be judged, not for who they are, but for their ability to honorably serve this country.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several religious political extremist groups reportedly are meeting at the Family Research Council&#146;s Washington headquarters today to strategize on ways to thwart the selection of Evertz. The leaders of several conservative groups have expressed outrage at the administration for hiring a qualified individual &#151; simply because he is gay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush may think the Log Cabin Republicans delivered him the election,&#148; American Renewal President Richard Lessner told the Washington Post. &#147;If that is the case, he is sorely deluded.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Evertz&#146;s whole approach is homosexuality is a viable life alternative ... that it&#146;s part of God&#146;s design in humanity,&#148; Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, told the newspaper. &#147;Bible-believing Christians don&#146;t believe that for one second.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is interesting that Sheldon is opposing Evertz for his religious beliefs,&#148; said Stachelberg. &#147;During the Ashcroft hearings, Sheldon said that to oppose a person based on religious beliefs is &#145;insulting and dangerous to religious freedom.&#146;&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Evertz, who was selected on Wednesday to head the AIDS policy office, is the president of the Wisconsin chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation&#146;s largest lesbian and gay Republican group. He was one of a dozen openly gay Republicans to meet with Bush in Austin during his presidential campaign last fall. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community. </font></p>
