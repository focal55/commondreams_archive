- May 24 - Senator Jim Jeffords is a champion for the environment, regardless of what

party label he wears.  For years, he has fought ardently for clean air and

water, battling against polluters, standing up to defend America's

beautiful landscapes, and staring down those who put profits ahead of our

families' health.  The Sierra Club has long admired Senator Jeffords'

courage and leadership on environmental issues.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

It is expected that Senator Jeffords's decision to become an Independent

will result in his chairing of the Environment and Public Works Committee

and Senator Daschle becoming Majority Leader.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

With Senator Jeffords heading the Senate's environment committee, the

safeguards protecting America's air, water and lands will be in good hands.

Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) becoming Majority Leader in the Senate will be a

positive step for the environment, both because of Senator Daschle's

dedication to clean air and water, and because Senator Trent Lott (R-MS)

has ignored environmental protection as a priority.  With an Administration

hostile to the environment, Senator Daschle's leadership will be crucial to

blocking attacks to our clean air, clean water, and public lands.

Senator Jeffords has long been a leader on a wide variety of environmental

issues.  A few of his environmental achievements include:</font>

</font>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Public Lands:</b> Senator Jeffords was one of two Republican cosponsors of

the Arctic Refuge Wilderness Act to protect the coastal plain of the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge from dangerous oil drilling.  Additionally he has

voted to protect our unique and beautiful national monuments.<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Renewable Energy:</b> Senator Jeffords has fought for funding for renewable

energy programs that help reduce our dependence on more polluting energy

sources.<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Clean Air:</b> In March, Senator Jeffords, along with Senator Joseph

Lieberman (D-CT), introduced the "Clean Power Act," which, if passed, will

dramatically cut power plant emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide,

mercury, and carbon dioxide by 2007.<br>

</font></li>

<li><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sprawl:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  Senator Jeffords set up the Senate Smart Growth Task Force,

which includes 24 Senators committed to curbing suburban sprawl. He has introduced the Post Office Community Partnership Act and is a cosponsor of

the High Speed Rail Investment Act, both of which will help reduce suburban

sprawl.  He supported the Dairy Compact which helps preserve family

farms and protects open space.<br>

</font></li>

<li><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Family Planning:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Senator Jeffords has been a leader on efforts to

eliminate the Global Gag rule which bans US funding for organizations in

other countries that use their own money to perform or educate about

abortion.

</font></li>
