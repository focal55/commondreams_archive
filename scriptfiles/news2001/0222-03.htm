- February 22 - A landmark report issued

today by three nuclear watchdog groups and the nation's largest

animal protection organization charges that the nuclear power

industry, contrary to its environmentally friendly public relations

image, has knowingly destroyed animals and delicate marine

ecosystems, and has routinely killed endangered species over the

past three decades due to the widespread use of an ecologically

harmful cooling technology.

<p>The report, "Licensed to Kill: How the Nuclear Power Industry

Destroys Endangered Marine Wildlife and Ocean Habitat to Save

Money," further documents a lack of oversight by governmental

regulatory agencies, particularly the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

(NRC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA), that may border on collusion.

<p>"Tragically, under the present regulatory system, the nuclear

power industry's needs almost always prevail over the interests of

marine life," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe

Energy Communication Council (SECC).

<p>"Instead of applying sanctions when a nuclear plant kills more

than its allotted quota of endangered species, NRC almost always

supports industry attempts to raise the limits on the number of

animals that can be killed or captured during reactor operation,"

Denman added.

<p>The Safe Energy Communication Council, Nuclear Information and

Resource Service (NIRS), Standing for Truth about Radiation (STAR),

and The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), are the four

groups issuing "Licensed to Kill."

<p>"The nuclear power industry is essentially licensed to kill by

the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accommodate company profit

margins. Regulators are constantly pressured by the nuclear

industry to stretch the rules and not enforce such laws as the

Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act," said Michael

Mariotte, NIRS executive director.

<p>The report documents the nuclear power industry's use of the

ecologically harmful, but relatively inexpensive once-through

cooling technology responsible for devastating marine ecosystems

from New England to California.

<p>Once-through cooling technology is used exclusively in 48

nuclear reactors with 11 additional reactors employing the

technology in conjunction with cooling towers and canals. These

reactors, situated on coastal waters, major rivers, and lakes can

draw in as much as a billion gallons of water per reactor unit a

day, nearly a million gallons a minute, in order to dissipate the

extraordinary amounts of waste heat generated in the fission

process.

<p>The initial devastation of marine life and ecosystems stems from

the powerful intake of water into the nuclear reactor. Marine

life, ranging from endangered sea turtles and manatees down to

delicate fish larvae and microscopic planktonic organisms vital to

the ocean ecosystem, is sucked irresistibly into the reactor

cooling system, a process known as entrainment. Some of these

animals are killed, either through impingement (animals are caught

and trapped against filters, grates, and other reactor structures),

or, in the case of air-breathing animals like turtles, seals, and

manatees, drown or suffocate.

<p>"Nuclear power stations are routinely allowed to destroy

alarming percentages of fish stocks and larvae entrained through

cooling water intakes," said Bob Alvarez, executive director of the

STAR Foundation, based on Long Island Sound. "In contrast, the

commercial fishing industry must submit to strict regulatory

standards including fines and license suspension for illegal

takes."

<p>The report notes that an equally huge volume of wastewater is

then discharged at temperatures up to 25 degrees F hotter than the

water into which it flows. Indigenous marine life suited to colder

temperatures is consequently eliminated or, in the case of endemic

fish, forced to move, disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.

<p>Moreover, the new, warmer ambient water temperatures often

encourage warm-water species to colonize the artificially

maintained warm-water zone. When the warm water flow is diminished

or halted because of maintenance, cleaning, or repair work on the

reactor, these species are often "cold-stunned;" many subsequently

die of hypothermia. Species affected include endangered sea

turtles, marine mammals, fish, and sea birds.

<p>In addition, the heated water is discharged with such force that

surrounding seabeds are often scoured to bare rock, leaving a

virtual marine desert bereft of life on the ocean floor.

<p>"Although responsible for enforcing compliance with intake and

discharge permits at reactors under the terms of the Clean Water

Act, the EPA has largely failed to establish national performance

standards," said Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Watchdog

Project at NIRS and a report author. "When faced with the

opportunity to enforce "best available technology" standards, the

EPA has buckled to industry pressure and left the marine

environment to pay the price."

<p>Similarly, state water and wildlife authorities fall prey to

nuclear industry pressure tactics and falsifications. In numerous

incidents, nuclear utilities have falsified data and concealed and

withheld information from environmental regulators that would have

revealed the true extent of the environmental damages wrought by

their reactor operations.

<p>In perhaps the most egregious example, the California utility,

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), for many years, provided state

water

authorities with skewed data that omitted known marine damage by

its Diablo Canyon reactors.

<p>PG&amp;E claimed that the plant's intake and discharge of billions

of gallons of seawater a day did little harm to the surrounding

marine community. In reality, the plant's operation had devastated

marine ecosystems for miles up and down the coast and was

responsible for the near obliteration of already threatened black

and red abalone populations in the area.

<p>Finally threatened with legal action by regulators, PG&amp;E

nevertheless managed to undermine the state's cease-and-desist

order by promising to outspend the authorities on legal appeals,

effectively tying up any lawsuit in litigation for years. State

authorities backed down from stopping the damaging thermal

discharge and agreed to a settlement that includes a cash amount of

just $4.5 million and other half-measures that will allow the PG&amp;E

and Diablo Canyon to continue its business-as-usual practices to

the detriment of the marine environment.

<p>"The nuclear industry plans to roll back environmental

protections to create a new bottom line," said Linda Gunter, SECC

Communications director, one of the report's authors. "The

industry cries poverty when asked to install less destructive

systems and again when told to mitigate the environmental damage,"

continued Gunter. "While nuclear utilities advertise themselves as

environmentally friendly, in reality they are sacrificing the

marine environment and its inhabitants on the altar of company

profits."

<p>The list of once-through nuclear reactors in the United States

includes the Diablo Canyon and San Onofre complexes in California,

which supply 20 percent of the total electricity to the strained

California power grid; Millstone in Waterford, CT; Crystal River

and the St. Lucie in Florida; Calvert Cliffs in Maryland; and

Seabrook in New Hampshire.
