<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - October 4 - Units of the Colombian military and police 

continue to work with and tolerate the illegal paramilitary groups 

responsible for the country's most serious human rights violations, 

Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, titled The 'Sixth Division': Military-Paramilitary Ties and 

U.S. Policy in Colombia, charges that Colombian military and police 

detachments continue to promote, work with, support, profit from, and 

tolerate paramilitary groups, treating them as a force allied to and 

compatible with their own. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Sixth Division' is a phrase Colombians use to refer to              

                                 paramilitary groups, seen to act as 

simply another part of the Colombian military. The Colombian Army has 

five divisions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At their most brazen, the relationships described in this report involve 

active coordination during military operations between government and 

paramilitary units; communication via radios, cellular telephones, and 

beepers; the sharing of intelligence, including the names of suspected 

guerrilla collaborators; the sharing of fighters, including active-duty 

soldiers serving in paramilitary units and paramilitary commanders 

lodging on military bases; the sharing of vehicles, including army 

trucks used to transport paramilitary fighters; coordination of army 

roadblocks, which routinely let heavily-armed paramilitary fighters 

pass; and payments made from paramilitaries to military officers for 

their support. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch urged the Colombian government to enforce effective 

measures to cut these ties and punish the officers responsible, after 

investigations carried out by civilian courts. President Andr&eacute;s Pastrana 

has publicly deplored paramilitary atrocities. But the armed forces have 

yet to take the critical steps necessary to prevent future killings by 

suspending high-ranking security force members suspected of supporting 

these abuses, Human Rights Watch said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Pastrana has recognized the problem, but the military has yet 

to take the appropriate measures to solve it,&quot; said Jos&eacute; Miguel Vivanco, 

Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. &quot;This has 

serious implications for Colombia's international military donors, 

especially the United States.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on months of investigation, including two missions to Colombia and 

interviews with victims, witnesses, and investigators, the report also 

addresses U.S. policy toward Colombia. Human Rights Watch contends that 

the U.S. has violated the spirit of its own laws and in some cases 

downplayed or ignored evidence of continuing ties between the Colombian 

military and paramilitary groups. Among the recipients of U.S. aid is a 

unit implicated in a serious abuse. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also analyzes the impact of President Bill Clinton's 

decision, in August 2000, to waive human rights conditions attached to 

the Colombia aid package. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When the United States waived the human rights conditions that applied 

to security assistance to Colombia, it sent a direct message to 

Colombia's military leaders that overshadowed any other related to human 

rights,&quot; Vivanco said. &quot;Put simply, the message was that as long as the 

Colombian military cooperated with the U.S. anti-drug strategy, American 

officials would skirt their own human rights laws.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the report, Human Rights Watch focuses on three Colombian Army 

brigades: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty-Fourth Brigade: Human Rights Watch has collected evidence showing 

that in 1999 and 2000 the Twenty-Fourth Brigade, based in the state 

(department) of Putumayo, actively coordinated operations with           

      paramilitaries, and some officers in charge of troops received 

regular payment from paramilitaries for their cooperation. This 

relationship persisted even as the U.S. planned and implemented its 

&quot;push into southern Colombia&quot; in the region under Twenty-Fourth Brigade 

control. The Colombian counter-narcotics battalions created with U.S. 

funds and trained by the U.S. military, actively coordinated with the 

Twenty-Fourth Brigade, using its facilities, intelligence, and 

logistical support during this effort. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third Brigade: Building on evidence set forth in previous reports, Human 

Rights Watch has collected new information that the Third Brigade, based 

in Cali, Valle, has continued to promote, coordinate with, and assist 

paramilitaries in southwestern Colombia. According to testimony that 

Human Rights Watch collected, Third Brigade officers maintained constant 

communication with paramilitaries in the field using cellular phones and 

radios. Soldiers also reportedly &quot;moonlighted&quot; as paramilitaries, and 

paramilitaries stayed on military bases and used military 

transportation. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that soldiers also 

threatened civilians by telling them that paramilitary forces would 

follow Colombian Army troops and carry out atrocities in their wake.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fifth Brigade: The area under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Brigade, 

based in Bucaramanga, Santander, was the scene of a recent and 

successful paramilitary offensive. Paramilitaries seized control of over 

a dozen towns along the Magdalena River, meeting virtually no resistance 

or even response from the Colombian security forces. Paramilitaries made 

their first-ever bid to conquer a major city, Barrancabermeja. Even as 

paramilitary fighters take over whole neighborhoods and issue threats, 

local military and police authorities remain largely passive, using 

excuses to elude responsibility for taking effective action. </font></p>
