- June 11 - The Sierra Club today expressed profound disappointment

with President Bush's latest refusal to take meaningful action to curb

global warming. This morning, the President called for more study into

global warming, despite the fact that the world's leading climate

scientists, including a National Academy of Sciences report released last

week, has concluded that global warming is real and that we must take

immediate action.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's approach to global warming is like commissioning a study

on fire while your house burns down,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of

the Sierra Club. &quot;The President should act now to cut global warming

pollution with cleaner cars and power plants, not more delay.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated that without

policy changes, U.S. emissions of global warming gases will rise 35 percent

by 2020.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush's approach of merely studying global warming is

irresponsible and will embarrass the United States in front of the rest of

world,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;We must take steps to curb global warming now,

since delaying action will only make the problem worse.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January of this year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

(IPCC) stated that human populations and the world's ecosystems are

threatened by worsening heat waves, floods, drought, extreme weather and

spreading infectious diseases caused by global warming. The IPCC projected

that the earth's temperature will rise as much as 10.4 degrees F this

century and concluded that human-made global warming pollution has

&quot;contributed substantially to the observed warming over the last 50 years.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a report

requested by the Bush administration which, &quot;confirmed again the broad

scientific consensus that has emerged over the last decade--that

human-caused climate change is underway and, if ignored could have severe

impacts on natural and managed ecosystems and human systems, such as health

and water resources.&quot; (NAS release) The NAS also stated their support for

the findings of the IPCC.  They &quot;strongly affirmed previous IPCC findings

and praised the IPCC for its comprehensive and balanced capture of the

problem.&quot; (NAS release)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States is the world's number one global warming polluter, with

23 percent of the world's global warming pollution yet only 4 percent of

the world's people. U.S. cars and light trucks alone emit more pollution

than all but four countries (U.S. China, Russia, Japan) . While other

countries must do their fair share to cut their emissions, the U.S. should

take the lead by using available technology to reduce our pollution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of these sensible cost effective solutions, the President is

proposing more study and voluntary measures. &quot;When it comes to cutting

global warming pollution voluntary measures don't cut it,&quot;  concluded Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunately there are simple, practical steps we can take right now to cut

global warming pollution.</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The single biggest step we can take to curb global warming is to raise

   automotive miles per gallon standards (mpg) to 40 mpg for cars, SUVs and

   other light trucks.  This would cut carbon dioxide pollution by 600

   million metric tons, and save consumers at least $45 billion each year

   at the gas pump by saving 3 million barrels of oil per day.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Replace old power plants with cleaner, efficient plants.  High

   efficiency combined-cycle gas-fired power plants are twice as efficient

   and can be 10 times cleaner than old gas plants.  Sited appropriately,

   these plants would dramatically reduce emissions.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increase use of renewable energy.  A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)

   in which 20% of all electricity sold would be derived from appropriately

   sited wind, solar, geothermal, or biomass energy by 2020 would greatly

   reduce our reliance on polluting fossil fuels.
