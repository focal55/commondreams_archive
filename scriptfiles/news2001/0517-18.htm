- May 17 - This week at the World Health Assembly, the delegation from 

the Bush Administration led by HHS head Tommy Thompson, a former 

governor with no global health experience has continued to work to 

block practical and pressing proposals to increase the availability 

of HIV/AIDS treatment, care and prevention worldwide, publicly

Last Friday, Bush announced a $200 million contribution to the new UN 

AIDS trust fund, a sum called paltry by advocates who note that $7 10 

billion is needed to begin to control the epidemic. At the annual 

WHA, which mandates the work of the World Health Organization, the US 

delegation has worked to undercut support for lifesaving AIDS 

medication and related goods and materials; persisted in opposition 

to a badly-needed database on sources of drugs and costs; and refused 

to support an expansion of the antiquated Essential Drugs List. They 

have also refused to talk about accepted HIV prevention methods, such 

as condoms, speaking only of abstinence.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Thompson has stated that AIDS requires the &quot;magnitude of the 

Marshall Plan,&quot; which brought substantial US financing to post-WWII 

Europe, his actions at the WHA have fallen far short of this 

pronouncement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, Thompson pledged allegiance to a group of representatives 

of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 

Associations, saying, &quot;I want you to understand I'm fighting your 

fight for you. The Brazilians, they want this drug database.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, IFPMA ejected Brazilian government representatives from a 

press conference where they sought to discredit the highly successful 

Brazilian program of AIDS medication production, importation and 

distribution, which has cut their AIDS death rate by over half. There 

was also a delay in distribution to two key resolutions on drugs 

access sponsored by Brazil, reportedly due to US interference, that 

left delegates from across the world scrambling for copies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The US is using a series of dirty tricks to do the bidding of 

industry,&quot; added Paul Davis of the Health GAP Coalition, &quot;Instead of 

fighting AIDS, they are fighting off sound public health measures in 

the face of an escalating global crisis.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While delegations from poorer nations consist of one or two 

officials, the US delegation headed by Thompson includes over 20 

members and advisors, including Jeanne Head, UN lobbyist of the 

International Right to Life Federation. Representatives from the 

American Public Health Association, the American Medical Association, 

and other key public health professionals who usually participate as 

part of the US delegation were told their services are not needed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; Is the Bush Administration working towards the cause of global 

health, or for the drug industry and pro-lifers? He acts as if 

limited charitable reductions in the prices of some drugs will solve 

a global epidemic. Regarding HIV prevention, Thompson at the WHA has 

only talked about abstinence - as if it is the only way to prevent 

HIV,&quot; said Asia Russell of the Health GAP Coalition, in reference to 

yesterday's speech by Thompson. &quot;These purposeful oversights and 

departure from public health wisdom cost lives.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">US AND THE FUND</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kofi Annan, the United Nation's Secretary General, called for the 

creation of a huge health fund with an annual commitment of US$7-10 

billion during a meeting in Nigeria last month. Former President 

Clinton and others have commented that the US can afford, and should, 

provide 25% of this amount. However, the first government 

contribution to the fund has been a US$200 million donation made by 

the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration's decision to give such a small amount has 

already threatened the life of the fund. Why are we sending Powell to 

feel the pain of Africa next week if we aren't also sending our fair 

share of resources,&quot; said Asia Russell of the Health GAP Coalition, 

referring to Powell's scheduled visit to African nations struggling 

to combat the escalating AIDS epidemic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At WHA, the Bush Administration has highlighted its stated intention 

to lobby for donations from corporations, in an effort to deflect 

overall attention from the paltry US contribution with an infusion of 

corporate charity. Already the lack of commitment from the Bush 

Administration to the UN Fund has had a chilling effect, as other G-8 

nations have de-emphasized their support of the fund, or have 

announced significant reductions in the amounts of earlier donation 

proposals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DELAY IN CIRCULATIONS OF RESOLUTIONS FROM BRAZIL AFTER U.S. COMPLAINTS</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Wednesday, there was an unprecedented delay in distribution of two 

resolutions from Brazil, regarding drug access, after the US vocally 

opposed the resolutions. This specifically violates WHA mandates, 

which state that all resolutions must be distributed with 24 hours 

notice to all delegates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first resolution, concerning the need for WHO to encourage member 

states to provide treatment for HIV,  the use of global fund for AIDS 

to include support for treatment, and the establishment of a drug 

database to assist countries in their efforts (see Drug Database, 

below).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second resolution addressed the WHO Revised Drug Strategy on the 

need for different prices for drugs, according to the resources and 

health needs of different nations</font></p>

<p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After the United States decried these resolutions, delegates had to 

fight to get a copy to even see them,&quot; explained Rob Weissman of 

Health GAP. &quot;It's no secret that the US is on a full offensive 

against Brazil, and the costs are open debate, full disclosure of 

information and, ultimately, lives.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DRUG DATABASE</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Delegation advisor William Steiger, special assistant to Thompson, 

has cited easily debunked concerns about price collusion and US 

anti-monopoly laws as reasons to deny this essential tool to the 

world community. In addition, the US has stated that it is not the 

role of the WHO to be a clearinghouse for price information, even 

though this proposal is a key component of efforts to extend 

life-saving medication to the 50% of world residents with virtually 

no access to medication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the second year that the US has worked against WHO's creation 

of an accessible database of worldwide drug prices, providing crucial 

data for cash-strapped countries. Last year, the US led and won the 

fight to weaken Brazil's initial amendment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This common-sense tool could offer poor countries significant buying 

power, but remains unacceptable to the multi-national pharmaceutical 

interests crawling the halls at the Assembly,&quot; said ACT UP's Paul 

Davis. &quot;A simple database, updated regularly, would expose shocking 

price differences between patented and generic AIDS drugs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  In many countries with generic competition, the price of patented 

drugs remains as much as 95% higher than the price of generic 

medicines. Much-touted price reduction offers from AIDS drug patent 

holders continue to place prices above generics and the vast majority 

of offers are extremely limited in geographical scope and only apply 

to government purchasing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  HEALTH GAP COALITION DEMANDS THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Immediately cease opposition to, and interference with, proposals 

from resource-poor and non-G8 nations to increase access to AIDS 

treatment, care, and prevention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Allocate $2 billion in new US money to the UN fund for AIDS 

treatment, care and prevention</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Establish parity in financial support for treatment and prevention</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Support global AIDS drug distribution and procurement at lowest 

prices, including access to generics, and the establishment by WHO of 

a full drug database</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Immediately call on the IMF and World Bank to use its own 

resources to cancel debt owed by the world's poorest countries; the 

US must also call on the World Bank to abandon its support for user 

fees for health care and education</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Immediately end the WTO dispute against Brazil over compulsory 

licensing and Brazil's domestic patent law</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Support the creation of health exceptions to trade agreements, 

such as the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual 

Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AIDS activist have called for public protest, focusing on the US 

stance on AIDS treatment, care, and prevention, on June 23, 2001, 

right before the opening of the UN General Assembly Special Session 

on HIV/AIDS.</font></p>
