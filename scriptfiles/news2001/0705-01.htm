- July 5 - In Maine, due to quickly 

rising premiums, both individuals and small employers are being 

crunched out of the health insurance market; consequently, one in 

three Mainers are either uninsured or underinsured. Governor Angus 

King and the state legislature recently created a commission 

charged with developing a plan for the implementation of a 

single-payer, universal health care system in Maine for 

presentation to the legislature in March 2002. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's 

largest, independent medical student organization, enthusiastically 

commends the people of Maine, the state legislature, and the 

Governor for taking the bold step needed toward ensuring that all 

Mainers have access to comprehensive, high-quality health care. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Maine has always demonstrated a pioneering spirit in health 

care, and this effort demonstrates Maine's commitment to making 

high-quality health care accessible to everyone,&quot; said Jaya 

Agrawal, AMSA national president and a fourth-year medical student 

at Brown University. &quot;In a single-payer system, money is dedicated 

to the provision of health care, not insurance companies' 

administrative costs, stock dividends, or CEO salaries,&quot; Agrawal 

continued. &quot;We know that with Maine's continued determination, they 

will not merely demonstrate this fact, but ignore the special 

interests and become the first, but certainly not the last state, 

to implement a system that provides health care coverage of the 

highest quality for all residents of their state.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA has supported a single payer health care system for more 

than 30 years. Just as medical students have been vocal proponents 

within the medical community of a &quot;Medicare-for-all&quot; system, Maine 

has led the nation in creating novel programs that serve as models 

for increased health care access. Recent studies in both 

Massachusetts and Maryland have shown that a single-payer system in 

those states would provide high quality health care for all 

citizens while saving millions of dollars. </font></p>
