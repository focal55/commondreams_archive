- May 18 - Opponents of a bill that would ban same-sex marriage in Massachusetts as well as prohibit domestic partner benefits for public employees greatly outnumbered proponents during a marathon, 11-and-a-half hour committee hearing in Boston Thursday. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H. 3375, also known as &quot;Super DOMA&quot; and the &quot;anti-gay, anti-family&quot; bill, would define marriage as between one man and one woman and would also forbid any legal recognition for same-gender couples and their families, including domestic partners and civil unions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Family diversity is a fact of life in Massachusetts,&quot; said Tim McFeeley, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. &quot;Through adoption proceedings and other measures, family courts in Massachusetts have been creating and protecting families headed by same-sex couples for many years. Super DOMA would put the courts against the legislature and endanger existing families in the state, as well as cast a shadow of doubt over the future of adoptions by same-sex couples.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 150 people attended a press conference opposing the bill, and then attended a hearing before the Joint Committee on the Judiciary. Opponents of the bill -- including representatives of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups, legal groups, adoption professionals, clergy and labor organizers -- greatly outnumbered a small handful of proponents. The hearing began at 1 p.m. and finally adjourned at 12:30 a.m. Friday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGLTF, in conjunction with groups such as the Freedom to Marry Coalition of Massachusetts and the LGBT Political Alliance of Western Massachusetts, organized opponents to attend the hearing. NGLTF sent direct mail to its members who live in the legislative districts of Judicial committee members, generated dozens of witnesses against the bill and hundreds of legislator contacts, and assembled an coalition that included People For the American Way, the Interfaith Alliance, the Japanese American Citizens League, SEIU Massachusetts State Council, the Massachusetts Libertarian Party, and others. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society.</i></font></p>
