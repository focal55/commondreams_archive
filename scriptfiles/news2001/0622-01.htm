- June 22 - While the Justice Department moves ahead to arrange settlement talks with major tobacco firms, critics are speaking out. The following tobacco policy advocates are available

for interviews:

Noltenius, executive director of the Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco, said today: “Too many people have died of tobacco-related diseases for the Justice Department not to put its

strongest case forward to recoup at least some of the health care costs. The

federal government should negotiate from a position of strength, not weakness.

This new administration has to be responsive to the needs of all communities --

specifically including Latino and other minority communities -- who feel

strongly that they have been targeted by the tobacco industry.”

<P>

<LI>STANTON GLANTZ, <A REF="mailto:glantz@medicine.ucsf.edu" href="mailto:glantz@medicine.ucsf.edu">

Glantz is professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and author of <I>The Cigarette Papers</I> and <I>Tobacco War</I>. He was responsible for unearthing large quantities of previously secret tobacco industry documents. Glantz said today: “The tobacco industry is now getting a ‘Get-out-of-jail-free’ card from the

Bush administration as a reward for the millions of dollars in campaign

contributions that the industry has given the Republican Party, including Bush

himself, in recent years. The actions of the administration are not surprising,

given that the administration is permeated from the top down with people with

close ties to the tobacco industry -- including Karl Rove, who is Bush’s top

political advisor; Ted Olson, the solicitor general, who sued the University of

California on behalf of a front group indirectly established by Philip Morris

in an effort to stop my research; and the people in the Federal Trade

Commission in charge of tobacco policies. For the Bush administration to claim

that the case is weak is to ignore the evidence that the Justice Department has

amassed to date, as well as the fact that the trial court judge ruled that the

racketeering part of the case could move forward. The racketeering part of the

case is the most serious aspect of the case, and the easiest to prove given

what we already know about the industry’s coordinated deceit over the past 50

years.”
