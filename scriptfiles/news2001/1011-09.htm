- October 11  - Greenpeace activists protested this morning in Santarem Harbour-a major exit point for Amazon timber to the European and U.S. markets-demanding an end to illegal and destructive logging in the region. The protest comes the day after an announcement that the organization's Amazon Campaign Coordinator, Paulo Adario, received a death threat. Greenpeace vowed to continue its campaign to protect the Amazon rainforest. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will not be silenced,&quot; said Greenpeace campaigner Marcelo Marquesini. &quot;Death threats will not stop us from exposing evidence that clearly shows the Amazon is being destroyed by those who will stop at nothing, until there is nothing left to destroy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activists painted the message &quot;Amazon Crime&quot; on stockpiles of timber that were being loaded onto the ocean freighter Illapel, destined for Portugal, Spain and The Netherlands. Another Greenpeace team painted the same message on the side of the Illapel, and two activists climbed the anchor chain of the ship unfurling a banner that also read &quot;Amazon Crime.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest marked the release of a Greenpeace report: &quot;The Santarem Five and Illegal logging: A Case Study,&quot; with data on five logging companies responsible for 72 percent of Santarem timber exports in 2000. Research by the international environmental organization concluded that these companies purchased timber of illegal origin. Greenpeace requested that the Brazilian Government carry out a complete investigation into the companies exposed in the report, and demanded the cancellation of Forest Management Plans (FMP) of logging companies that are known to be involved in illegal activities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;U.S. companies buy from several of the companies implicated in this report,&quot; said Greenpeace Ancient Forest Campaigner Scott Paul. &quot;Customers have the right to know whether or not they are buying products from illegal and destructive sources.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most of the timber produced in Santarem is exported, primarily to Europe and the U.S. One of the major international traders is the Danish company DLH/ Nordisk, which sells to Belgium, Denmark, China, United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United States. In some cases Forest Management Plans have been cancelled by IBAMA, (the Brazilian Government Environmental Agency) due to illegalities, but companies ignored the cancellations and continued to log illegally. </font></p>
