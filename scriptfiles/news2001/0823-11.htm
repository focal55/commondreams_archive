- August 23 - Progressive activists from Spanish speaking communities from 

across Southern California will gather to make plans to reclaim KPFK 90.7 

Pacifica Radio. KPFK management has dismantled most of the Spanish language 

programming and almost all public affairs programmers of color have been 

fired or purged in the last five years. Critics say KPFK management has been 

unwilling to tap into the resources and needs of the more than three million 

Latinos in their listening area.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KPFK was founded over 40 years ago with the mission of serving the 

information and cultural needs of the diverse communities within its signal 

area;  progressive activists built it, sustained it and helped it grow. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHO</b>: Juan Gonzalez, activist, former Pacifica Radio co-host of Democracy Now!,

 columnist NY Daily News, author Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in 

America  and founder of the Pacifica Campaign, will be the key note speaker. 

Music by: Son Real.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Community radio is one of the best ways through which we can reach a mass 

audience" said Arturo Lemus, a conference organizer. "Our diverse communities 

in Los Angeles and Southern California have a right to local community radio 

stations that serve their information and cultural needs. We must reclaim and 

transform KPFK into a truly democratic and progressive community radio 

station."







</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a Washington Post column yesterday "In Image Battle, Pacifica Takes 

Aggressive Action," Pacifica, CEO Bessie Wash was quoted as expressing 

concern about the lack of programming for Los Angeles' Latino communities on 

Pacifica station KPFK. What Wash didn't say is that the Pacifica regime that 

installed Wash in her current and previous positions is responsible for that 

lack of coverage.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the past five years, KPFK/Pacifica management has:</font>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forbidden news personnel to use Spanish pronunciations of Spanish words</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Removed the only Latino drive time talk show host in Los Angeles and 

replaced him with an Anglo</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shortened, then cancelled, "Radio Chicana" a bi-lingual program on Latino 

issues, culture and history</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Caused the resignation of young Latino programmers by criticizing the use 

of expressions like "peace and love" because it would "alienate"older 

listeners</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Severely reduced all Latino-oriented programming, and Latino-produced 

information programming in English or Spanish.



</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, Pacifica Radio co-host Juan Gonzalez dramatically resigned 

on-air in protest at the anti-democratic policies of the Pacifica national 

board. "The Pacifica board has been hijacked by a small clique that has more 

in common with corporate vultures than with working-class

Americans," he explained, vowing to lead a nationwide campaign to restore 

democratic accountability at the network.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Pacifica Campaign is a grass-roots organization representing listeners 

and staff alike fighting to preserve Pacifica's 50-year tradition of 

progressive, community-based radio and is co sponsoring this event with 

Aztlan Media Collective and Comite Pro-Democracia en Mexico.
