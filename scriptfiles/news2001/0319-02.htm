- March 19 - On Wednesday, March 21st, Bread for the World Institute will

release its annual report on world hunger, which concludes that for

a penny a day per American, the United States can lead an

international campaign to cut world hunger in half by the year

2015. Foreign Aid to End Hunger is Bread for the World Institute's

11th annual report on the state of world and U.S. hunger.

<p>The report recommends that Congress and President Bush start

with $1 billion a year in additional U.S. aid and debt relief for

sub-Saharan Africa, where hunger is most widespread and

intractable. This U.S. commitment, the report says, would prompt

other industrial nations to provide more aid.

<p>The Institute, a Washington education and research center, is a

partner organization of Bread for the World, a nationwide Christian

citizens movement against hunger.

<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, 291 million people live on less than $1

a day, and one person in three is chronically undernourished. The

region's problems have been exacerbated by civil wars, HIV/AIDS,

declining agriculture, huge foreign debts, inadequate education and

health care, and a lack of roads and other infrastructure.

<p>To overcome hunger and poverty, the report says, African

countries need to improve agriculture and food distribution, build

infrastructure, enroll more children in school, empower and educate

women, prevent and treat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and start new

businesses and microenterprises. Bread for the World Institute

recommends a long-term U.S. aid partnership to help African

countries make these investments.

<p><i>Bread for the World is a 45,000 member Christian citizens'

movement against hunger. Founded in 1974, Bread for the World's

members lobby Congress and the administration to bring about public

policy changes that address the root causes of hunger and poverty

in the United States and overseas. Bread for the World is a

nonpartisan organization supported by 45 denominations and many

theological perspectives. Please visit our Web site at
