Newman is chair of the Judicial Nominations Committee of the National Lawyers Guild. He said

today: "With the changeover in control of the Senate, there is now the

chance for a counterbalance to Bush's attempt to pack the federal courts with

right-wing appointees.... The loss by the Republicans of control of the

Judiciary Committee should give the Democrats a veto on such nominations, a

quite appropriate process in view of the closeness of the election, to assure

that only those judges moderate enough to be acceptable to the broadest range

of Americans will be confirmed."

Executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, an association of attorneys, legal workers, law students and jailhouse lawyers, Boghosian said today: "Given the Supreme

Court's interference in Bush's selection for the presidency last fall and given

the fact that a majority of the population voted against his election, it is

the Guild's position that Bush has no legitimacy to appoint judges and thereby

control the third branch of our government, the judiciary. We call on senators

to block all nominees until a nonpartisan process for selecting judicial

nominees is developed which reflects the majority view in this country in

support of civil rights, environmental regulations and protection of civil

liberties.&quot;

Roth is director of advocacy and public policy for the National Council on Independent Living. She said today: "People with disabilities from across the country are looking

to the Senate to signal its continued support for our civil rights law, the

Americans with Disabilities Act, by refusing to confirm Jeffrey Sutton to the

Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is critically important that the Senate act

to block his nomination."
