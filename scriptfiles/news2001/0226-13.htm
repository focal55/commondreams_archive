- February 26 - Democrats.com today exposed the deliberate distortion of the Miami-Dade 

recount story by the Miami Herald, USA Today, and the national news media. 

In addition, Democrats.com published an investigative report documenting 

the failure of election officials in eight counties to count &quot;write-in 

overvotes&quot;, as required by Florida law.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats.com co-founder Bob Fertik published an article entitled, &quot;Bush 

Propaganda Machine Distorts Miami-Dade Recount Story,&quot; which described the 

media's distortion as a continuation of a propaganda campaign by the Bush 

campaign that began on Election Day, when George W. Bush unexpectedly 

found himself trailing in Florida. Fertik's article is available here:

<a href="http://democrats.com/view.cfm?id=1604">http://democrats.com/view.cfm?id=1604</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's misleading headlines by the Miami Herald and USA Today are just 

another attempt to legitimize Bush's stolen presidency,&quot; said Bob Fertik, 

co-founder of Democrats.com.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following a recount of undervotes in Miami-Dade County, the Miami Herald 

and USA Today reported a net gain of 49 votes for Al Gore. This finding 

was interpreted to mean that Al Gore would not have gained enough votes to 

defeat George Bush during the initial recount that ended with Katherine 

Harris' certification of a 537-vote victory for George W. Bush on November 

27, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Herald's headline read:

DADE UNDERVOTES SUPPORT BUSH WIN

Review of ballots by Herald suggests Gore recount effort would have failed</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">USA Today's headline read:

Study: Gore would not have won on recount</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, these reports missed two key facts:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The Palm Beach Post completed a manual recount of undervotes in Palm 

Beach County on January 27, 2001 and reported a net gain of 682 votes for 

Al Gore. Along with the 49 votes found in Miami-Dade, Bush's 537-vote 

victory turns into a 194-vote defeat.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The 4-county recount requested by Al Gore was rejected by the Florida 

Supreme Court's ruling on December 8, 2000, which ordered a state-wide 

recount of 43,432 &quot;undervotes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats.com has been tracking the progress of the state-wide recounts by 

various news organizations at a special web site, 

<a href="http://gorewonflorida.org">http://gorewonflorida.org</a>. With the addition of 49 votes in Miami-Dade, Al 

Gore's lead in Florida now stands at 1,017. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats.com also published an exclusive investigative report documenting 

the failure of election officials in eight counties to count &quot;write-in 

overvotes&quot;, as required by Florida law. The article reveals for the first 

time that hundreds - possibly thousands - of Florida votes for Al Gore and 

George W. Bush were never counted because marks in the &quot;write-in&quot; section 

of the ballot caused these ballots to be incorrectly treated as 

&quot;overvotes,&quot; even though Florida law is crystal-clear that such votes 

should be counted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris certified more than 28,000 

overvotes from counties that violated Florida law by ignoring such votes. 

A recount of such votes in Lake County by the Orland Sentinel in December 

added 130 votes to Gore's total. Had these votes been properly counted in 

the eight counties identified, Al Gore may well have been declared the 

winner in Florida. The complete article by Paul Lukasiak is available 

here: 

<a href="http://democrats.com/view.cfm?id=1609">http://democrats.com/view.cfm?id=1609</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the state-wide media recount is completed, Democrats.com expects Al 

Gore to be declared the winner. At that point, the 51 million voters who 

voted for Al Gore will know that George W. Bush stole the Presidency with 

the help of the U.S. Supreme Court, which issued a narrow partisan ruling 

to stop the Florida recount in order to install Bush as President.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will not rest until the truth is known - and until the thieves who 

stole the Presidency are removed from office and brought to justice for 

their crimes,&quot; Fertik concluded.
