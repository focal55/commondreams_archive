- July 11 - Reform opponents in Congress may offer an amendment

to the Shays-Meehan bill which would strip the right of legal

permanent residents to contribute to federal candidates, in a

blatant attempt to drive Hispanic members of Congress off the 

bill.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of the pro-reform coalition delivered the following

letter to the House of Representatives urging that the defeat

of such an amendment: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

Dear Representative:<br>

	<br>

As a coalition representing millions of Americans, we strongly urge you to vote for H.R. 2356, the Shays-Meehan bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation, and vote against any amendment that would prohibit legal permanent residents from making campaign contributions to candidates.  Such an amendment would not only function as a &#147;poison-pill&#148; amendment by undermining the bipartisan coalition supporting meaningful campaign finance reform, but it is also misguided policy that should be refuted on the merits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legal permanent residents pay taxes and are required to defend this country in times of war; they are &#147;citizens in training,&#148; who have the right to express their political views in our democracy.  This amendment would take away their right to participate in the political process through campaign contributions and exclude them from future participation.  Legal permanent residents should not be denied their right to make federally legal contributions to those whose views they support. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a bipartisan coalition of organizations representing a wide variety of Americans, we firmly believe that effective campaign finance reform is necessary and immediately needed, and should protect the right and opportunity for legal permanent residents to participate in the political process.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge you to support Representatives Shays and Meehan in their efforts to pass bipartisan campaign finance reform.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
