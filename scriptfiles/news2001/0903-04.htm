decried the decision of the United States delegation to withdraw from 

the United Nations World Conference against Racism.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Conference presents a unique opportunity for the nations of the 

world to define, condemn, and remedy racism and racial discrimination,&quot; 

said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;The U.S. 

should be part of that process, and its departure is a deep 

disappointment to the victims of racism who have placed their hopes in 

this meeting.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secretary of State Colin Powell announced today that the U.S.            

                                   delegation was going home, saying 

that the conference was bound to                                         

     contain hateful language against Israel, and that negotiations 

would be futile. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch said that the U.S. should have stayed at the 

conference and worked to ensure that objectionable language on Israel 

that was proposed in the draft be removed. The group also emphasized 

that the question of Israel's treatment of Palestinians is only one of 

many before the conference. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. is squandering a unique opportunity to stand against 

intolerance, take pride in its own successes, and face up to the 

challenges in the long fight for equality at home and abroad,&quot; said 

Brody. &quot;This meeting is about the millions of refugees who are fleeing 

racism but who find intolerance, about the so-called untouchables of 

South Asia, about how HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects people of 

color, about the unique ways racism and sexism interact, and about 

racism in the application of the death penalty. These are issues that 

the United States wanted to avoid, but clearly it cannot.&quot;</font></p>
