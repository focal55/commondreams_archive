- January 3 - In advertisements running today in several national

newspapers, the Sierra Club called on President-elect George W. Bush to

rise above partisan politics and to act as "chief steward of America's

environment to protect our air, water and wild lands and wildlife."

<p>

"The overwhelming majority of Americans agree that we need to protect our

environment," said Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's executive director.  "We're

calling on President-elect Bush to recognize this mandate and to deliver on

his promise to unite Americans around the shared value we all place on

protecting our air, water and wild places."

<p>

Specifically, the Sierra Club ad asks Bush to:

- Rid the air of dangerous soot and smog;

- Clean-up toxic waste and other pollution that threatens our drinking

water;

- Protect pristine wild places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,

the Sequoia National Monument and the still-untouched areas our National

Forests;

- Pull the grizzly bear and salmon back from the brink of extinction;

- Act quickly to curb global warming;

- Ensure the environment is protected in an increasingly globalized

economy; and

- Restore faith in democracy by enacting campaign finance reform that makes

it harder for polluters to influence policy and politicians.

<p>

"President-elect Bush can shape an environmental agenda that gives

Americans what we want -- clean air to breathe, pure water to drink and

wild lands to explore and enjoy," Pope added.  "The Sierra Club will

trumpet every act of environmental courage by President-elect Bush, and we

will lay out for judgement every sideways glance at a campaign donor."

<p>

The advertisement is slated to run in The New York Times, The Washington

Post, the Austin-American Statesman, Roll Call and the Weekly Standard.

<p>

Text of the advertisement follows below:

<p>

President-Elect Bush:

As a politician, you will be judged by the voters in four years.  As a

President, you will be judged by generations to come. That's why we're

asking you to rise above partisan politics and work as President -- as the

chief steward of America's environment -- to protect our air and water,

wild lands and wildlife.

<p>

As President, you will decide what is in the air we breathe and the water

our children drink.  Work with us to protect our families from poisons and

pollution.  Help us rid the air of dangerous and asthma-triggering soot and

smog. Together, let us rid our water of health-threatening arsenic and

mercury and clean up the toxic waste that's put too many communities across

America at risk.

<p>

As President, you will shape the land we leave behind.  Understand that all

Americans share a love of our landscape. Unite us in an effort to stop the

development of our still-wild places -- places like the untouched areas of

out National Forests, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the

Everglades.  And recognize, as Americans, that we have welcomed and

rejoiced in the protection of our most beautiful places as parks and

monuments, including the newly-named Grand-Canyon Parashant and Sequoia

National Monuments.  We urge you to honor and increase our legacy of

protected wild lands.

<p>

Right now, we stand at a pivotal moment in our natural history.  Over the

next four years, you will have the opportunity to pull the salmon and

grizzly bear back from the brink of extinction, help dissolve the dark

shadow global warming casts over our children's future, ensure the

environment is protected in our increasingly globalized economy, and

restore faith in our democracy by enacting campaign finance reform that

makes it harder for polluters to influence policy and politicians.  We look

to you for leadership.

<p>

During your campaign, you said, "I know our prosperity will mean little if

we leave future generations a world of polluted air, toxic waste and

vanished wilderness and forests."  We agree.  And we ask you to act on this

promise to protect our nation's health and beauty, for our families, for

our future.

<p>

Paid for by the Sierra Club.
