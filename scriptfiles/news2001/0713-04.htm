- July 13 - Tomorrow's test of the Pentagon's national missile defense system is only

the fourth of 21 scheduled tests. Single test results provide only modest

indications about the future effectiveness of missile defense.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This missile defense test should be treated as one of a long series of

evaluations to determine if the system works; it should not be overblown,&quot;

said Dudley Herschbach, a Nobel laureate and professor of science at

Harvard University who serves as the chair of the Council for a Livable

World Education Fund. &quot;Tomorrow's results do not mean the U.S. can build an

effective defense.  We are a very long way from deploying even a white

elephant system,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herschbach added, &quot;This project has nothing to do with genuine defense, but

rather with defending a political stance.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If you look at the Administration's overall strategy, the test almost

seems irrelevant,&quot; said Jerome Grossman, chairman of the Council for a

Livable World.  &quot;The Administration is pushing ahead furiously to deploy a

missile defense system whether it works or not &#151;  despite questions about

cost, the technology, the nature of the threat, and the possibility of

violating the ABM Treaty.  It appears determined to proceed at any and all

costs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is much skepticism about missile defense in advance of this latest

test. The system now being developed has flunked two of the three tests in

which the performance of major components was evaluated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The limitations of the missile defense testing program have been noted by

Pentagon officials. Philip Coyle, formerly director of Operational Testing

and Evaluation for the Pentagon, said the tests lack &quot;operational

realism...While a successful intercept during any future flight test will

be a significant achievement,&quot; it should be viewed in the context of built

in &quot;limitations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among those limitations, Coyle said, is the reduction in the number of

decoys used in testing from nine to one. The use of decoys is intended to

make it difficult for the missile defense system sensors to identify the

actual war head.  Critics have accused the Pentagon of carefully scripting

the tests to increase the chances for a successful intercept.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coyle has pointed out that determining the effectiveness of a missile

defense system in real world conditions will take years, and deployment at

least a decade.
