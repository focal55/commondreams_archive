- November 8 - The Sierra Club this week is launching a series of newspaper

ads nationwide encouraging Americans to explore and enjoy the great

outdoors to relieve stress during these uncertain times. The ads guide

readers to an internet feature called &quot;A Special Place&quot; where Sierra Club

members share their favorite recreation spots to help people locate outdoor

treasures. That website is <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/specialplace" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/specialplace</a>.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since September 11 people have been trying to cope with the uncertainty of

terrorism, and Mother Nature can help us heal,&quot; said Sierra Club President

Jennifer Ferenstein.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ads, headlined &quot;America is on the mend, and nature can help us heal,&quot;

were inspired in part by the American Red Cross' advice for coping with

terrorism: &quot;Sit under a tree, look at a brook, lake, river or ocean.

Remember that you are still free and that there is still beauty in the

world.&quot; The ads will run in newspapers in 14 states and the District of

Columbia twice this week ? Wednesday in the front section and Friday in the

&quot;weekend&quot; section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a report released October 22 by the Outdoor Industry

Association, Americans view National Parks and mountain resorts as the

safest weekend and vacation destinations in the wake of the terrorist

attacks. Another survey released this week by outdoor retailer Recreational

Equipment, Inc. (REI) found that 93 percent of respondents say spending

leisure time outdoors is very or extremely important, and 70 percent plan

to spend time doing outdoor activities this holiday season.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In an effort to return to normalcy, Americans are looking to the outdoors

for comfort,&quot; Ferenstein said. &quot;They feel safe getting back to nature ?

back to hiking, hunting, fishing, and biking.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People can log on to the website to read about special places, share the

stories behind their special places, locate places near them to explore,

and identify areas that need protection. Some favorites include the urban

climbers' sanctuary of Rat Rock in New York City's Central Park,

off-the-beaten-path Ruby Lake in southern Colorado's Weminuche Wilderness

Area, Mammoth Cave along the Green River in Kentucky, and the rewarding

trek to Half Dome Summit in Yosemite.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Your special place can be as famous as a National Park or as ordinary as a

neighborhood pond. But whether it's a childhood favorite or a recent

discovery, it's a place that means something to you, and that's all that

matters when it comes to healing,&quot; Ferenstein said.
