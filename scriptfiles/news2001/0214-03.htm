- February 14 - The trial of the D.C. Democracy

Seven, arrested for protesting Congressional

oppression of the District of Columbia last summer,

concluded today in D.C. Superior Court with both the

government and defense resting their cases.  At 10:30

a.m. on Wednesday, February 14, Judge Anna

Blackburne-Rigsby will instruct the jury of D.C.

residents to deliberate as to each defendant's guilt

or innocence.   



<p>If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty

of six months in jail and/or a $500 fine. 



<p>The trial was the second resulting from an incident on

July 26, 2000, when Martin Thomas, Karen Szulgit,

Tanya Snyder, Queen Mother ShemaYah, Debby Hanrahan,

Bette Hoover and Steve Donkin were arrested in the

U.S. House of Representatives Visitors' Gallery for

allegedly chanting "D.C. Votes No! Free D.C.!" during

a Congressional vote on the District of Columbia

Appropriations Bill. 



<p>At the Seven's first trial last October, prosecutors

dismissed without explanation charges faced by Thomas.

The remaining six defendants went to trial and

received a hung jury, at which point the judge

declared a mistrial and government prosecutor Andrew

Lopez immediately asked for a new trial. 



<p>During the two days of testimony in the current trial,

the prosecutors called upon two U.S. Capitol Hill

police officers to testify and showed a C-SPAN video

tape of the alleged disruption to the jury.  



<p>Non-voting Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.)

testified for the defense that Congressional

proceedings were never disrupted by the "commotion" in

the Visitors' Gallery that day.  



<p>She also testified extensively about her role in

Congress as a non-voting delegate, particularly as it

applies to her inability to have any influence on the

process by which Congress annually approves D.C.'s

budget. 



<p>The D.C. Appropriations Bill enables Congress to

control the city's budget, the domain of municipal

authorities in all other U.S. cities, and also

includes riders that overturn locally passed

legislation. 



<p>These riders prohibited D.C. from enacting Initiative

59, passed overwhelmingly by D.C. voters in 1998,

which would allow use of medical marijuana by patients

with serious and terminal illnesses. 



<p>The riders also gutted D.C.'s locally funded needle

exchange program, designed to control the spread of

HIV; restricted use of local money to fund family

planning for low-income women; and prohibited use of

city funds to sue Congress for D.C. voting rights. 



<p>"This is the wrong trial, " said Anise Jenkins,

President of the Stand Up for Democracy in D.C.

Coalition.  "Congress is guilty of disrupting the

lives of D.C. residents." 



<p>Attorney Paul R. Hurst of Steptoe & Johnson, LLP, has

joined the defendants' legal team, which also includes

attorneys Reginald Williamson and Veta M. Carney, both

of whom represented defendants at the last trial. 



<p>After the verdict is rendered, defendants and defense

attorneys will be available for interviews.  More
