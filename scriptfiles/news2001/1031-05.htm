<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - October 31 - The record number of Green Party

candidates competing in the November election includes

more African-American candidates running for state and

local office than ever before, including city council

incumbents and a candidate running for Governor of New

Jersey.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Not only has the party's growth manifested itself in

a vastly increased number of candidates in 2001, but

it has included a growing presence in the nation's

urban cores and its largest cities, alongside an

increasing racial diversity among Green candidates,"

said Mike Feinstein, Mayor of Santa Monica,

California, who tracks the party's election campaigns.





</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current list of elected Greens includes Latinos in

some prominent city offices: Municipal Judge Fran

Gallegos and City Council Member Miguel Chavez in

Santa Fe, New Mexico; City Supervisor Matthew Gonzalez

and At-Large Board of Education Member Marc Sanchez in

San Francisco, California; and Social Development

Commission Member Robert Miranda in Milwaukee,

Wisconsin.  Elizabeth Horton Sheff (see below), who is

African-American, holds a City Council seat in

Hartford, Connecticut.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Originally cast in the late 1980s and early 1990s as

a rural, Anglo middle-class environmental party,

Greens are now showing an increasing presence in the

nation's urban areas, and are presenting an

increasingly diverse face in its candidates.  In 2001,

this is most apparent in the number of African

American candidates for the Greens, particularly in

the Northeast.  This may come as a surprise to those

who felt the Democrats had a lifetime 'lock' on some

constituencies.  But it has not been a surprise to

Greens who believe in the party's progressive agenda

and feel that it was only a matter of time (and hard

work) before increasing numbers of people from diverse

backgrounds would be attracted to it."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elizabeth Horton Sheff is running to hold on to her

seat in the City Council of Hartford, Connecticut. 

Ms. Horton Sheff became the first African American

Green elected to public office when she won her

Council seat running on an urban/inner city agenda in

1999.  This year she hopes to be joined in office by

several more African American Greens.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==> NEW JERSEY 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jerry Coleman is the Greens' "yes!" answer to the New

York Times question "Isn't it time for an

African-American candidate for governor in New

Jersey?"   A long-time urban activist, Coleman focuses

on environmental justice and racism, affordable

housing (especially for seniors), and a healthy urban

environment.  Coleman has been outspoken against

racial profiling and police brutality, and advocates

the establishment of civilian police review boards.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==> MINNESOTA 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Minneapolis, three African-American Green

candidates are running: three-term incumbent Annie

Young, seeking re-election to the Minneapolis Park and

Recreation Board, which controls the city's vast park

system; Brother Shane Price in Ward 3 member of City

Council; and Natalie Johnson Lee for Ward 5.  Both

Price and Johnson seek to serve some of the city's

poorest residents, focusing on education, local

economic development, housing, justice and the

environment.  The burden of maintaining some racial

diversity on the City Council there is falling mostly

on the Greens; unless Price, Lee, or the city's lone

Democratic African-American candidate are elected,

Minneapolis could end up with no African-Americans  on

council for the first time in 30 years.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brother Shane Price, a Green running for Minneapolis

City Council Ward 3, is a minister who once served

prison time and has since become the organizer of an

annual march for peace and justice through his

community.  Price calls himself a "recovering

Democrat."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Natalie Johnson Lee has drawn extensive press coverage

as an African-American woman taking on City Council

President Jackie Cherryholmes.  Lee has worked

extensively on provision of housing, racial profiling

and other community issues with the NAACP and other

community organizations.  She came in a close second

to the incumbent in the primary.  Cherryholmes has

raised nearly $40,000 from corporate interests in

order to hold her seat in exchange for some well-known

favors.  Minnesota Green activist David Strand said,

"The incumbent chose to skip several high profile

African-American community debates after her first

encounter in which Natalie confronted her and spoke

truth to power."  Ward 5 is approximately 60%

African-American but includes a portion of pricey

downtown condos that Jackie Cherryholmes helped get

city subsidies to build.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==> WASHINGTON



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Young Han, Green Party candidate for 21st District in

the State Legislature race in Washington State, made

the national news earlier this year when a Republican

political consultant tried to infiltrate his campaign

and contribute money, which Han returned.  Han is the

first Green Party candidate on the ballot for state

legislature in Washington State.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Han, at 18 the youngest among many young Greens

running for office, represents the growing popularity

of the Green Party among voters under 30, the age

group with the highest registration in the party.  If

Han wins, he'll join another elected Asian-American

Green, Shwaw Vang, Madison (Wisconsin) School Board 

member who defeated a Democrat in a head to head race.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"At the national level, there is no longer an

opposition party," said Young Han.  "There is only a

ruling coalition.  Here in Washington State, the major

parties are constantly trying to undermine democracy,

but are, thankfully, bickering with each other as to

how to do it.  My message of election reform, and

instant runoff voting in particular, has resonated not

only with average voters, but also with elected

legislators who don't appreciate what their party

bosses are trying to do.  The idea of getting to rank

candidates is quite catchy with just about everyone."
