- February 26 - Weakened environmental protections and &#147;wrong-headed&#148; energy policies are the cornerstones of the energy bill introduced today by Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK) charged a public interest advocacy group.  According to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the bill includes provisions to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling; roll back the Clean Air Act for certain power plants, and give away a host of new subsidies to the oil, coal and nuclear industries.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Arctic Refuge is one of America&#146;s last wild places.  It should not be ruined to extract less than six months worth of oil,&#148; said Athan Manuel, Director of the PIRG&#146;s Arctic Wilderness Campaign.  &#147;We need an energy policy that focuses on efficiency and renewables instead of drilling in America&#146;s Arctic. Raising miles per gallon standards for cars and light trucks would save us at least fifteen times the oil we&#146;d ever get from the Arctic Refuge and we&#146;d see those savings at the pump,&#148; he added.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Murkowski bill&#146;s so-called &#147;clean coal&#148; provisions create new subsidies and tax breaks for coal-fired power plants and an exemption from Clean Air Act requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;At a time when 132 million Americans live in places where the air is unsafe to breathe, the Murkowski bill gives big, coal burning power plants a free pass to pollute our air for ten years without worrying about enforcement of the Clean Air Act,&#148; said Becky Stanfield, a staff attorney.  &#147;This wrong-headed bill would allow companies to use taxpayer dollars to invest in their old coal plants, and gives these companies a 10-year exemption from clean air rules limiting toxic mercury, smog and soot pollution. It's a polluter&#146;s dream, but a nightmare for public health and the environment,&#148; she added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to expanding the so-called &#147;clean coal&#148; program, the new bill contains other extensions and expansions of several other &#147;polluter pork&#148; subsidies, such as nuclear research and development programs, and royalty reductions for oil companies.  These are programs targeted in the Green Scissors 2001 report.  This report, released by U.S. PIRG, Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense and environmental and fiscally conservative groups across the country, targets 74 programs that harm the environment and cost $55 billion.  The report is available at <a href="http://www.greenscissors.org">www.greenscissors.org</a>.</font></p>
