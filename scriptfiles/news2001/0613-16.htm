- June 13 - <i>&quot;If we are truly a compassionate nation, we must begin facing 

the reality that our economic policies do not address the widening 

gap between the haves and the have-nots.&quot; 

</i>-- Rev. Welton Gaddy </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the interest of justice and fairness, President George W. 

Bush and members of Congress have a moral obligation to increase 

the minimum wage to address the struggles of the working poor in 

our nation, according to The Interfaith Alliance (TIA). This 

afternoon, the nation's largest interfaith political advocacy 

organization joined a coalition of religious, civic and labor 

leaders calling for a $1.50 increase in the federal minimum wage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If we strive to be a fair and just society, then we have a 

moral obligation to address the appalling gap between the haves and 

have-nots in our nation,&quot; said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, 

executive director of TIA. &quot;Albeit modest, a $1.50 raise will 

begin addressing the crisis facing the working poor in our nation. 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I've heard our president speak about the compassion for the 

poor in terms of charity, but I wonder, is there a similar 

commitment to creating compassionate and just economic policies 

that close the gap between rich and poor?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition effort, organized by the National Campaign for 

Jobs and Income Support, released a letter to President Bush and 

members of Congress calling for &quot;a much-needed boost to 11 million 

hard-working Americans.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An excerpt from the letter states: &quot;The issue is one of basic 

human rights and economic fairness and should transcend party 

lines. However, we are gravely concerned by reports that some in 

Congress will propose an even smaller increase of only $1.00 over 

three years, as well as amendments that would compromise the 

40-hour work week and strip overtime pay from millions of workers. 

We are most disturbed by proposals that would effectively repeal 

the federal minimum wage law by allowing states to opt-out of any 

increase. We vigorously oppose these attacks on historic 

protections.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was signed by 26 national leaders including the Rev. 

Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of TIA; Rabbi David 

Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform 

Judaism; and the Rev. Robert W. Edgar, general secretary of the 

National Council of Churches. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1994, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan
