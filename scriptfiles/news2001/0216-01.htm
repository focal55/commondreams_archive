- February 16 - A new study profiling

gay voters shows that gay and lesbian people are becoming

politically involved and that the general voting population is more

aware of issues that are important to the gay community.

<p>The study called Out of the Closet and Into the Voting Booth:

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Voters in 2000 examines an

often under-counted portion of the electorate and was completed

during the 2000 election by Denver-based Gill Foundation.

<p>Some key findings from the research include the following:

<p>-- Knowing someone who is LGBT makes a difference. 37 percent

of voters familiar with LGBT people say their personal relationship

has increased their awareness of LGBT issues. 26 percent of likely

voters say they have a family member who is LGBT. 32 percent of

likely voters know a close personal friend, 44 percent know a

co-worker and 63 percent say they have a friend or acquaintance

that identifies as LGBT. Only 9 percent of the respondents to a

survey of all likely voters said they did not know anyone who was

LGBT.

<p>-- Voting matters to LGBT individuals. 92 percent of LGBT

respondents said they are registered to vote, 52 percent say they

vote in all elections and 34 percent say they vote in most but not

all elections.

<p>-- LGBT voters, like other voters, embrace political moderation.

In terms of political philosophy, 43 percent of LGBT voters

identify as moderate compared to 40 percent of voters in the total

U.S. population.

<p>-- More LGBT people are comfortable coming out. Half of LGBT

voters consider themselves to be very open about their sexual

orientation while 35 percent say they are not open at all about

their orientation.

<p>Copies of the report can be obtained by calling the Gill

Foundation at 303-292-4455 or by visiting their Web site
