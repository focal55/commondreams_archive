<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -  

 November 6 - Calling on Judge Colleen 

Kollar-Kotelly to &quot;send this unchastened monopoly juggernaut a 

sterner message&quot; than that contemplated by the proposed settlement 

between Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department, consumer 

advocate Ralph Nader and James Love, director of the Consumer 

Project on Technology have urged in a letter to that the settlement 

of the antitrust settlement of the Microsoft case be significantly 

strengthened before being approved. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader and Love said they were disappointed that the settlement 

moved away from a structural remedy -- such as a breakup of the 

company -- saying that such an approach &quot;would require less 

dependence upon future enforcement efforts and good faith by 

Microsoft, and ... would jump start a more competitive market for 

applications.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the context of a conduct-oriented remedy, Nader and Love 

said it was &quot;astonishing that the agreement fails to provide any 

penalty for Microsoft's past misdeeds, creating both the sense that 

Microsoft is escaping punishment because of its extraordinary 

political and economic power, and undermining the value of 

antitrust penalties as a deterrent.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader and Love praised certain elements of the agreement, 

including those relating to Microsoft's efforts to design its 

operating system to avoid interoperability with competitors' 

software, but said these provisions needed expansion and 

strengthening. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They focused special attention on efforts by Microsoft to 

undermine the free software movement, which the company has said it 

regards as key competitive threat. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The overall acceptance of Microsoft's limits on the sharing of 

technical information to the broader public is an important and in 

our view core flaw in the proposed agreement,&quot; Nader and Love 

wrote. &quot;The agreement should require that this information be as 

freely available as possible, with a high burden on Microsoft to 

justify secrecy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, they wrote, &quot;the agreement provides Microsoft with a 

rich set of strategies to undermine the development of free 

software.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader and Love also contended in the letter that the consent 

decree's central proposed enforcement mechanism, a Technical 

Committee over which Microsoft will have significant influence. &quot;One would be hard pressed to imagine an enforcement mechanism that 

would do less to make Microsoft accountable, which is probably why 

Microsoft has accepted its terms of reference,&quot; Nader and Love 

wrote. </font></p>
