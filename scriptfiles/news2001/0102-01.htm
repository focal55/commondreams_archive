- January 2 - As the criminal trial of Dr. James Pendergraft begins, the National

Organization for Women joins its members and allies in Florida in

supporting this abortion provider's right to protection from harassment not

only by violent protestors, but by local and federal government officials

as well.



<p>"As we approach the twenty-eighth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, women's

reproductive freedom is still under attack from all sides," said NOW

President Patricia Ireland. "Government officials and clinic terrorists

often work hand-in-hand to drive doctors out of business and out of town.

What is happening in Ocala, Florida, right now is a compelling example of

why women do not have access to abortion services in 89% of U.S. counties."



<p>The local U.S. attorney's office has charged Dr. Pendergraft, who has five

clinics in Florida, with lying under oath and conspiracy to commit

extortion and mail fraud; the charges grew out of the doctor's civil suit

against Marion County and the town of Ocala for their failure to protect

employees and patients at his local facility. Dr. Pendergraft faces a

possible 30 years in prison, loss of his medical license and a fine of more

than a million dollars.



<p>Dr. Pendergraft has met with hostility from the start in Ocala. The chair

of the board of county commissioners, Larry Cretul, urged the doctor in a

letter to "reconsider" opening the clinic. According to a sworn statement

by Dr. Pendergraft's business associate, Cretul also asserted in

conversation that it was not a question of "if," but only "when" the clinic

would be firebombed. Arson attacks closed Ocala's only previous clinic in

1989, and no one has ever been charged with the crime. Once the clinic

opened, the city police chief refused to allow the clinic to hire off-duty

officers to work as security guards, protection routinely permitted to

other businesses in the area. As a result, out-of-control protestors have

wreaked havoc outside the clinic, frightening patients and staff and

forcing Dr. Pendergraft to wear a bullet-proof vest and helmet.



<p>"These criminal charges against Dr. Pendergraft, on what seems the

flimsiest of evidence, appear to be just another way of trying to prevent

him from providing reproductive health services in the state. All of his

clinics are in jeopardy, as are the rights of women in Florida and across

the country as a result of this prosecution," said Ireland.



<p>"NOW supports the right of abortion providers to practice medicine with

protection, not intimidation from government officials at all levels. We

call upon Attorney General Janet Reno to review the action taken by the

local U.S. attorney's office and bring to an end this government-sponsored

harassment."
