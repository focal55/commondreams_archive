- January 10 - The following was

released today by Handgun Control:

<p>-- Handgun Control Announces Web Site To Oppose Ashcroft As

Attorney General

<p>--<a href="http://www.ashcroftandguns.com"> www.ashcroftandguns.com

</a>Details Why Americans Should Be

Concerned About Ashcroft's Willingness to Enforce and Defend

Nation's Gun Laws

<p>As part of its grassroots effort to defeat John Ashcroft's

nomination as Attorney General, the nation's largest gun violence

prevention group has launched a re-vamped version of the Web site,

<a href="http://www.ashcroftandguns.com">www.ashcroftandguns.com. </a>The

site, which Handgun Control had set

up in 2000 to educate voters about Ashcroft's pro-gun record during

his failed Senate re-election campaign, has been revised to address

the impact of his extremist positions on the role of Attorney

General.

<p>www.ashcroftandguns.com represents the first time in the

organization's history that Handgun Control has devoted an entire

Web site to the defeat of a nominee for a position in a President's

Cabinet. Visitors to the site can read in-depth information on

Ashcroft's record, learn why his relationship to the gun lobby and

his alarming views on the Second Amendment raise serious doubts

about him as Attorney General, and send a letter to their Senators

expressing their opposition to the Ashcroft nomination.

<p>"Every American, including every Senator, should visit

www.ashcroftandguns.com," said Michael D. Barnes, President of

Handgun Control. "Senatorial courtesy is clearly outweighed by

this nation's right to an Attorney General who will enforce and

defend our gun laws. John Ashcroft should be rejected."

<p><i>------

<br>

Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by

Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun

violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law

enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across

the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun

control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has over

500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it the nation's

largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More

information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to

Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our Web site at
