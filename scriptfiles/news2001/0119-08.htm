- January 19 -  The following is a

statement by Joan Malin, CEO of Planned Parenthood of New York

City:

<p>"On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its

decision in Roe v. Wade and for the first time recognized the

constitutional right to privacy includes a woman's decision whether

to terminate her pregnancy.

<p>"Sadly, as we commemorate the 28th anniversary of Roe, we once

again find ourselves preparing for new obstacles to a woman's

self-determination -- including the nomination of staunchly

anti-choice John Ashcroft for Attorney General and threats to

international and domestic family planning programs. This Saturday

Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) will join thousands of

other pro-choice Americans in Washington, D.C. to protest the

Ashcroft nomination and to send a message to the Bush

Administration that women have come too far and fought too hard to

have our legal rights taken away.

<p>"Today, twenty-eight years after the Roe decision, abortion is

10 times safer than childbirth. Legal abortion is associated with

decreases in maternal and infant mortality. The right to make

informed, personal decisions about their reproductive lives has

also enabled women to pursue educational and employment

opportunities unthinkable to women only a generation ago. Safe,

legal abortion is an essential part of women's reproductive health

care, yet today, American women face ever-broadening encroachments

upon their right to choose.

<p>"This year's anniversary of Roe is both a time to celebrate and

a time to prepare for future hurdles. The year 2000 saw many

hard-fought victories for the reproductive rights movement, from

the long-awaited approval of mifepristone to the Supreme Court

decision in Stenberg v. Carhart -- a decision that reaffirmed a

woman's right to choose. In the 2000 elections, a clear majority of

American voters supported a pro-choice presidential agenda and

voters in New York elected pro-choice Hillary Clinton to the United

States Senate.

<p>"The strength of pro-choice America forced anti-choice

presidential candidate George W. Bush to hedge on the issue of

choice during his campaign, but Mr. Bush has since revealed

stronger ties to the anti-choice efforts put forward by political

and religious extremists. In fact, it is predicted that Mr. Bush

will reinstate the Global Gag Rule as early as Monday, to coincide

with the anniversary of Roe. In the past, the Global Gag Rule

denied USAID family planning assistance to any organization abroad

who uses their own funds to provide abortion services or advocate

for abortion rights. The Global Gag Rule could not only prevent

women from accessing abortion services and information, but also

financially cripple the organizations that are best equipped to

provide other critical reproductive health and family planning

services to their communities. The Global Gag Rule may further

prohibit organizations abroad from lobbying their governments to

change laws and policies regarding abortion -- precisely the type

of lobbying that is legal in the United States.

<p>"PPNYC is ready and able to advance the cause of reproductive

rights and health, regardless of who is in the White House. We will

meet these obstacles with immediate action - from grassroots

mobilization to aggressive legislative advocacy, in order to defend

reproductive freedom for all women, in the United States and

abroad."
