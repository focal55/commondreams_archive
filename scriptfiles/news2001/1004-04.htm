<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 4 - Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee removed the remaining

sanctions on U.S. arms exports and military assistance to India and

Pakistan.  Lifting the last legal barriers prohibiting the sale of weapons

to these countries is dangerous both in light of regional instability in

South Asia, and the risk U.S. weapons being used against U.S. interests in

a future conflict.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exporting weapons to South Asia, one of the most politically volatile

regions in the world, could further destabilize the region and exacerbate

any future conflict between India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan have

fought three wars and countless border skirmishes over the past 50 years

and heightened tensions even further in 1998 by conducting nuclear

explosive tests. Pakistan itself is politically unstable, which may be a

reason behind the administration's hesitation to use Pakistan as a staging

ground for military action against Afghanistan. The United States should

not inject weaponry into this mix. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States must learn two lessons from past experience as a close

ally and supplier of weapons and training to Iraq, Iran and the Afghan

resistance: today's allies can be tomorrow's bitter enemies, and the United

States can not control the weapons it exports.  Should either regime in the

region collapse, it is unclear whether the new authorities would side with

the Taliban against U.S. efforts to combat terrorism.  More importantly, a

change in regime could impact whether U.S. military assistance and weapons

are used against U.S. interests.  Reports say the Taliban may posses as

many as 100 U.S.-supplied Stinger anti-aircraft missiles which now may

threaten American troops.  Congress and the President must be careful not

to create a similar situation in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On September 22, the President waived most of the economic and military

sanctions imposed on Pakistan and India after their nuclear tests. The

President has also authorized $100 million in military aid to Pakistan

under emergency provisions in existing U.S. law.  Considering that India

and Pakistan have a very low ranking in the United Nation's Human

Development Index, a measure of a country's economic and social

development, and face a huge social, economic and humanitarian emergencies,

any future U.S. assistance should address their pressing humanitarian

needs, not their ability to wage war with each other or against terrorists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is too soon to tell what, if any, military assistance India, Pakistan

and other countries in the region will need to fight terrorism.  Therefore,

it is premature to waive carefully crafted U.S. arms export law intended to

promote regional stability.</font></p>
