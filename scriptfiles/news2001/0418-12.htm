- April 18 - Common Cause released an 

assessment of a Capitol Research Group report yesterday 

which links the California energy crisis to campaign 

contributions from the utility industry and energy providers. 

It is widely recognized that energy industry money had a 

profound impact on shaping the failed deregulation legislation 

of 1996.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;California has some of the most lenient campaign finance 

laws in the country, leaving big industry an easy 

opportunity to buy influence from lawmakers,&#148; said 

National Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger. 

&#147;This is a call to speak up and fight for campaign 

finance laws on the state-level and to press your 

U.S. Representatives as the fight for McCain-Feingold 

moves to the House with the Shays-Meehan bill.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Consumers have cause to question whose interest will 

be in the minds of lawmakers as they craft a legislative 

response to the crisis &#150; the public interest or the 

special interests of well-financed energy industry 

players,&#148; said California Common Cause Executive Director 

Jim Knox.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report finds that utility companies, power generators 

and marketers, contributed over $600,000 to Governor Davis 

during the last election cycle. They gave over $3.3 million 

to state lawmakers, $820,514 to other statewide officers and 

$339,900 to political parties. In the past two years alone, 

energy special interests spent $16 million on political 

contributions and lobbying expenses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Washington, the fight for effective campaign finance 

reform continues. The McCain-Feingold bill passed in the 

U.S. Senate 2 weeks ago and awaits debate in the House.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      Utilities lobbied hard during crisis; 

      Legislators received millions, study shows 

      By Rick DelVecchio, Chronicle Staff Writer</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electric utilities blanketed California politicians 

with campaign and lobbying money at a time when the 

state was rolling downhill toward the current power 

crisis, Common Cause said yesterday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government watchdog group detailed $11.6 million 

in political spending by the state's major utilities 

in the 1999-2000 legislative and election cycle and 

characterized the record as a case study in the ability 

of powerful interests to influence policy makers through money. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The energy crisis story in California raises a national 

issue, not only because of the challenge of meeting the 

crisis itself but because it's a classic example of the 

influence, or the potential influence, of money in 

politics,&quot; Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger 

said yesterday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., Edison International, 

which owns Southern California Edison, and Sempra, 

the holding company for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, 

dished out $4.2 million in campaign contributions to 

state elected officials and $1.5 million in 

contributions to local officials during the 1999-2000 

period. They also spent $5.9 million on lobbying at 

the state level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gov. Gray Davis was the top recipient of campaign 

contributions from utilities, with $348,000, followed 

by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, 

with $172,000, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, 

D-Los Angeles, with $165,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'NO INFLUENCE' </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Davis denied that the contributions had any influence 

on his decisions during the energy crisis, saying he 

had stopped taking money from any involved groups in October. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That was well before the crisis developed,&quot; Davis said 

yesterday. &quot;I ceased taking any money from them. I cancelled 

some events that some of the folks were going to have for 

me in December.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Burton staunchly believes the utilities have no impact on 

his decisions on energy policy. &quot;If you take a look at 

who's leading the fight on behalf of the ratepayers, it's 

been me,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;I'm happy. Whether (the utilities) 

are happy, I can't tell you.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All but one of the 118 state legislators holding office 

or elected in the period received campaign contributions 

from the utilities. The lone holdout was Assemblywoman 

Gloria Negrete McLeod, D-Chino. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As the whole energy crisis evolved last summer, she made 

a conscious decision it was something she wanted to stay 

away from,&quot; said Don Wilcox, McLeod's chief of staff. 

&quot;As things were borne out, it was a wise decision.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wilcox said he did not believe that energy industry 

money had influenced energy policy. &quot;If money bought 

influence, the energy crisis would have been bailed 

out in the very beginning,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RETURN TO SENDER </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hertzberg, as the crisis broke open late last year, 

refused further contributions from the energy industry. 

He also returned industry contributions made to him 

during the last three months of last year, said spokesman 

Paul Hefner. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The support he receives from a wide variety of folks 

plays no role whatsoever in the policy positions he takes,&quot; 

Hefner said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the end of last year, financially struggling PG&amp;E 

temporarily suspended its political contributions in 

order to conserve cash. Spokesman Ron Low said there 

was nothing questionable about the firm's past 

political activities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We contribute to candidates who we believe are most 

qualified to serve the public,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Common Cause's Harshbarger believes those dollars 

swayed policy decisions in favor of the utilities. 

&quot;The special interests who pay to play get not only 

major benefits from their contributions to the leading 

elected officials in terms of defining the market, but 

also in terms of who was given priority to resolve the 

crisis financially,&quot; he said. &quot;The consistent loser was 

the average person.&quot;
