- May 17 - Following the release of President Bush's energy plan today

at a visit to St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) joined

Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), Senator Mark Dayton (D-MN) and others to

strongly criticize a policy that promotes more fossil fuel drilling and

production, loosening of pollution controls on coal and oil refineries, and deep

cuts to existing federal support for research and development of clean,

renewable energy sources.  Wellstone characterized the President's remarks at

the St. Paul event, which emphasized upbeat themes on energy conservation and

the environment, as &quot;greenwash&quot;.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is ironic that the President chose to announce this unbalanced policy at

District Energy in downtown St. Paul, a facility which uses clean, renewable

energy technology, just like that made possible by federal research funds.  The

President's budget wants to cut funding for those programs by 50%,&quot; Wellstone

said. &quot;The Energy Task Force Report fails to offer any solutions to the

short-term energy problems facing consumers across the country &#150; spiraling gas

and electricity prices &#150; and for the long-term, it looks backwards to more coal,

oil and nuclear power; less clean, non-fossil sources like solar, wind and

biofuels.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone vowed to press Congress to restore the Bush cuts of 50% to renewable

energy funds in the FY 2002 budget, and to restore funding for energy

conservation research and development, which the President's budget cut by 46%. 

Contrary to the widely reported suggestion by the Vice President that

conservation is little more than &quot;a sign of personal virtue,&quot; a recent report by

scientists at national laboratories concluded that improved energy efficiency

could reduce growth in electricity demand by nearly half.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone also promised to seek a Bush commitment to the largely untapped energy

produced by America's farmers: ethanol and biodiesel.  Greater use of these

fuels would decrease the need for imported petroleum products, help improve air

quality across the country by reducing carbon monoxide and other toxic emissions, and provide an

important economic stimulus to rural America. A 3% national market share for

ethanol and biodiesel, which Wellstone is pushing, would replace about 9 billion

gallons of gasoline annually or between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels of crude oil

each day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the sort-term, Wellstone challenged the President to exercise the 'bully

pulpit' to force big oil refiners to bring down spiraling gasoline prices that

are hitting consumers' pocketbooks in Minnesota and across the nation hard.  

While Vice President Cheney has said there is not much the Administration can do

about gasoline prices in the short-term, a Wellstone-initiated investigation by

the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) into Midwestern gasoline prices last summer

found that big oil refiners acted to further their own economic interest by not

expanding capacity to produce reformulated gasoline (RFG). While it may not

strictly have been illegal, the action confirmed suspicions of market

manipulation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The big oil companies don't want our country to move to renewable energy

development.  They support more drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

and the weakening of environmental, health and safety standards.  Minnesota is a

cold-weather state at the wrong end of the fossil fuels pipeline; we import

nearly all of our energy today.  We should be seeking to reduce our dependence

on unsustainable fossil fuels, not increasing that dependence.  The future of

the economy in my state is clean, efficient, renewable energy.  If the President

 wants to go there to talk about energy policy, he ought  to reconsider his

budget cuts in this area, and make a real commitment on renewable energy.&quot;

Wellstone said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone has been strongly critical of the Bush administration's position that

fossil fuels exploration and nuclear power is the only solution to the country's

long-term energy needs.  Wellstone rejects the Bush administration's plans to

help big business overturn environmental, health and safety laws.  He has spoken

out against the administration's plan to open our most pristine wilderness areas

to oil and gas drilling when the vast majority of America's energy resources are

already open to development.
