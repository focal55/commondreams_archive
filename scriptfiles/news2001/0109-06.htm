- January 9 - Americans

          United for Separation of Church and State today urged the Senate to

          reject the nomination of former Sen. John Ashcroft to be attorney

          general, arguing that his views are too far outside the mainstream.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ashcroft

          is an avowed opponent of the separation of church and state,&quot;

          said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;He

          is likely to use his office to further a reckless mixing of religion

          and government. We call on the Senate to reject his nomination.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

          United today <a href="http://www.au.org/pr1901rpt.htm">released a

          report</a> surveying Ashcroft's views on church-state issues and his

          ties to controversial TV preachers Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and D.

          James Kennedy and radio counselor James Dobson of Focus on the Family.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          AU report notes that Religious Right groups worked behind the scenes

          to torpedo rival candidates for the attorney general job and to

          promote Ashcroft. Many of these leaders had endorsed Ashcroft during

          his brief foray into presidential politics in 1997 and '98, the report

          notes.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ashcroft

          spent six years in the Senate taking orders from extreme TV preachers

          and their political allies in the Religious Right,&quot; Lynn charged.

          &quot;I have no doubt that he would do the same as attorney general.

          America deserves better.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although

          Ashcroft is best known for his strong anti-abortion views, the report

          notes that he was also the principal architect behind &quot;charitable

          choice,&quot; a plan to subsidize religious groups with millions in

          taxpayer dollars for providing social services. Ashcroft explicitly

          opposes any attempt to require participating houses of worship to

          abide by the separation of church and state.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          addition, Ashcroft has bitterly criticized the Supreme Court's rulings

          upholding the religious neutrality of the public schools. In 1998,

          Ashcroft addressed a gathering of Robertson's Christian Coalition,

          where he blasted church-state separation. Charged Ashcroft, &quot;A

          robed elite have taken the wall of separation built to protect the

          church and made it a wall of religious oppression.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn

          charged that Ashcroft has little or no appreciation for the First

          Amendment's religious liberty provisions. That fact alone, he

          asserted, makes him unfit for office.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Concluded

          Lynn, &quot;We do not intend to stand idly by and allow a man who does

          not appreciate one of the core principles upon which this nation was

          founded to become the highest law enforcement officer in the

          land.&quot;</font></p>
