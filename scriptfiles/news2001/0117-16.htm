- January 17 - Minutes before the Department of Defense was set to reopen the 

School of the Americas (SOA) under the name, &#147;Western Hemisphere Institute for 

Security Cooperation,&#148; four college students, Rebecca Johnson age 21 of 

Cincinnati, OH, Laurel Paget-Seekins, age 20 of Philo, CA, Joseph Floyd, age 

19 of Atlanta, GA, and Jole McGreevy, age 20 of Carlisle, PA, blocked the road 

leading to the SOA with their arms locked together inside pipes. Two other 

college students Becky Karasack, age 20 of Greensburg, PA, Rebecca Mantey, age 

21 of Haverford, PA, and Johnson&#146;s mother Deborah Meem, age 51 of Cincinnati, 

OH, attempted to walk to the reopening ceremony carrying a baby coffin to 

remind those attending the ceremony of the atrocities of the past carried out 

by SOA graduates. All seven were arrested and taken into military police 

custody. Johnson and Paget-Seekins, both seniors at Oberlin College, have previously been banned from the base and are risking up to six months 

in federal prison and a $5000 fine. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the vigil and civil disobedience at Ft. Benning, people in more 

than 45 cities nationally and internationally, as far away as Chile, Honduras, 

Costa Rica, Germany and Austria, held vigils, mock renaming ceremonies, and 

participated in nonviolent civil disobedience actions to voice their 

opposition to the school. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Johnson is on the 17th day of a month long juice only fast and vigil outside 

the main gates of Ft. Benning to protest the reopening of the SOA, &#147;I&#146;m not 

fooled by the name change, it&#146;s still a School of Assassins, and I&#146;m here to 

show that we are just as dedicated to close this SOA clone,&#148; asserted Johnson. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During its 54-year history, the SOA has trained over 60,000 Latin American 

troops in combat skills. SOA-trained troops have used these skills to wage war 

against their own people with disastrous results. Hundred of thousands of 

Latin Americans have been tortured, raped, &#147;disappeared&#148;, massacred or forced 

into refuge by those trained at the SOA. Dubbed the &#147;School of Assassins&#148; in 

Panama, SOA graduates continue to appear on the lists of current human rights 

abusers and to act with impunity in countries from El Salvador to Colombia. 

Colombian graduates have been implicated in recent atrocities and have been 

tied to paramilitary death squads. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s reopening is part of a &#147;reform package&#148; introduced by the Department 

of Defense in response to mounting pressure from Congress and the public to 

close the school. This &#147;reform package&#148;, which passed in the House of 

Representatives by a narrow 214-204 vote margin, has been called cosmetic by 

even the school&#146;s supporters. The SOA and its successor share the same 

facility, purpose, mission and history. Renaming the training facility at Fort 

Benning but failing to establish meaningful change does not rectify 

the systemic problems of this outdated and counter-democratic institution.</font></p>
