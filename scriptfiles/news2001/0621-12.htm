- June 21 - The international 

community cannot address the HIV crisis in the poorest countries 

without also agreeing to cancel more debt, campaigners said today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With dignitaries gathering in New York for the United Nations 

special session on AIDS next week, the Drop the Debt campaign 

released new figures showing that debt cancellation could have a 

dramatic effect through releasing in-country resources to repair 

deteriorating social infrastructure. The figures show how deeper 

debt cancellation would help improve the effectiveness of funds 

later released through the Trust Fund. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Sub-Saharan Africa spends $37 million per day repaying debts. 

Therefore the $200 million grant by the U.S. to the Global Health 

Fund is repaid in less than a week. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In Malawi, thirty per cent of school teachers are infected 

with HIV. One day's worth of debt repayments would allow 160 new 

teachers to be trained. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In Zambia, where one child in seven is an orphan because of 

HIV, four days of debt repayments could cover the annual costs of 

housing and feeding 10,000 children. This year, Zambia will pay 20 

times as much on debt as on dedicated HIV spending. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The $14.2 billion Sub-Saharan Africa spends on debt per year 

is considerably more than the $7 to 10 billion the UN estimate is 

needed each year to combat HIV/AIDS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last decade, the heavy burden of debt in many poor 

countries has prevented adequate levels of investment in health and 

education systems, clearing the way for the spread of HIV. For 

example, for most of the 1990s, Mozambique spent $5 per capita on 

health care, while $9 per capita went to foreign creditors. There 

is now just one hospital bed for every thousand people, while over 

ten percent of the adult population has HIV/AIDS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where debt service payments have been reduced in Africa, the 

benefits are clear. In Uganda, twice as many children are going to 

school; in Mozambique health spending is rising by $13 million a 

year. However, even the countries that have benefited from the 

international debt package are still spending more on debt than 

health. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lucy Matthew of Drop the Debt said: &quot;Deeper debt cancellation 

will inject the resources needed to revive health and education 

systems in Africa. Funds freed this way will repair and then 

pump-prime basic infrastructure, making subsequent resources from 

the Trust Fund far more effective. This crisis demands a more 

carefully designed rebuilding of infrastructure in Africa -- or 

funds, goodwill and above all lives will be wasted.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--- 

Notes </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 5,500 Africans die each day from HIV related diseases. The 

UN estimate that by 2010 there will be 40 million AIDS orphans. 25 

million African's are infected with HIV. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Core contributions to the Global Health Fund so far are $200 

million from the U.S., $140 million from France, and $100 million 

from the Bill Gates Foundation. Other countries are expected to 

contribute, but there is little evidence that amounts will reach 

the $7 to $10 billion annually that Kofi Annan is asking for to 

combat the crisis. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- There has been progress on debt cancellation for some of the 

poorest countries. As part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 

initiative, 23 countries have now had their annual debt payments 

reduced -- but only by just over one fourth. The seven richest 

countries have promised to cancel 100 per cent of the debts of 

these countries, but not all creditors have matched this. 

Multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and IMF are the 

remaining biggest creditors to these countries. If they were to 

cancel these debts, the impact of HIPC would be doubled. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A &quot;Dollars, Debt, Drugs&quot; march to raise awareness of 

solutions to the AIDS crisis in the poorest countries will take 

place on Saturday, June 23 in New York, organized by the Global 

AIDS Alliance, supported by Jubilee USA and Drop the Debt. Drop the 

Debt argues that deeper debt cancellation should go hand in hand in 

with more flexible sourcing of AIDS drugs and more aid for health 

and education, in an integrated package to fight global AIDS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: Drop the Debt spokespersons will be available at the UN 

throughout UNGASS. </font></p>
