<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  - October 30 - The war in Afghanistan has created a real concern that a domestic political

uprising in Pakistan could cause its nuclear weapons and materials to fall

into the hands of pro-Taliban forces.  In response to this concern, the

U.S. has been mulling the option of giving Pakistan permissive action links

(PALs), which are highly sophisticated electronic locks that prevent

unauthorized individuals from detonating a nuclear weapon. The U.S. should

not give Pakistan PAL technology.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There are many downsides to giving Pakistan PAL technology,&quot; said John

Isaacs, President of Council for a Livable World. &quot;First and foremost, it

would probably violate the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1968 NPT, signed by 187 countries, prohibits the five recognized

nuclear weapon states from assisting or encouraging any non-nuclear weapon

state to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive

devices.  PALs are an integral part of weapon design and supplying them to

another state would thus be considered nuclear assistance.   Pakistan,

despite the fact that it possesses nuclear weapons, has not signed the NPT

and is barred from receiving nuclear assistance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aiding Pakistan's nuclear program would also set a dangerous precedent for

other nuclear weapon states who may want to engage in nuclear cooperation

with proliferators.  For instance, China could increase its nuclear

cooperation with Pakistan, and Russia with India and Iran. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, Pakistan is believed to possess enough fissile materials for

between 30 and 50 nuclear bombs, and fissile cores are likely stored

separate from other weapon components. This condition of separability in

itself acts as a preventative measure against unauthorized use of nuclear

weapons.  PALs could simply give Pakistan an incentive to go ahead and

maintain fully assembled nuclear weapons, and even to operationally deploy

them, thereby increasing nuclear dangers in South Asia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The technology could make Pakistan less risk-averse with regard to

weaponization and deployment,&quot; said Steve LaMontagne, a nonproliferation

expert at the Council for a Livable World Education Fund.

 

PALs also involve highly classified encryption technology and could give

away sensitive information about the types of weapons in the U.S. nuclear

arsenal. Pakistan might therefore use PAL technology to derive some of the

secrets of advanced nuclear weapon design in order to further its nuclear

program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of giving Pakistan PAL technology, the U.S. should focus on steps

that promote political stability in Pakistan without violating the NPT,

sacrificing U.S. nonproliferation goals, or furthering Pakistan's nuclear

weapons program,&quot; LaMontagne added.  &quot;Our efforts should concentrate on

economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and debt relief, but not on this

type of nuclear cooperation.&quot; </font></p>
