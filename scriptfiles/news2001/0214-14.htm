- February 14 - FAIR is pleased to announce our first annual roundup of the year's most

egregious examples of owner, advertiser and government influence on the

news: &quot;Fear &amp; Favor 2000: How Power Shapes the News.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A &quot;serious&quot; talkshow turns itself into an infomercial for Campbell's Soup,

complete with a veteran news anchor leading a chorus of the &quot;M'm, m'm,

good!&quot; jingle. A Boston reporter is suspended without pay after writing

critically about a bank that is a major advertiser in his paper. A network

news show interviews a sock puppet-- a puppet that is the mascot for a

company the network's owner has a stake in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Welcome to the sometimes whimsical, frightening world of the corporate-owned

media, where the &quot;fear and favor&quot; of the powers that be can shape-- and

twist-- the news. A few items detailed in the report:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

--In the final days of the 2000 presidential campaign, conservative

Pittsburgh Tribune-Review publisher Richard Mellon Scaife ordered all photos

and prominent mentions of Al Gore removed from the front page.  As a result,

the pre-election Sunday edition featured George W. Bush in every front-page

campaign-related headline and photo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--The AP's longtime Bolivia correspondent, Peter McFarren, resigned amidst

revelations that he had lobbied the Bolivian legislature for a $78 million

water privatization project profiting a foundation he presided over. One of

the biggest stories in Bolivia, water policy was central to McFarren's beat.

After a query from FAIR, the AP did a story on the resignation, but glossed

over key aspects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--After receiving pre-publication complaints from various bigwigs, Brill's

Content watered down a piece whose subject-- entertainment reporter Lynn

Hirschberg-- apparently has too many powerful friends. Brill's editor David

Kuhn reportedly told staffers, &quot;You don't understand: I have to go to

cocktail parties with these people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Many journalists have heard war stories about controversial articles that

got cut or quashed before they were written, or, more chillingly, of careers

cut short. The breakneck consolidation of media ownership means news

divisions are increasingly subject to corporate control, but it can be

difficult to find documentation of specific instances in which this has

distorted the news. With that in mind, FAIR has compiled reports of some of

the most outrageous examples of &quot;fear and favor&quot; in the newsroom from the

last year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We hope &quot;Fear &amp; Favor 2000&quot; will serve to support journalists who are

struggling to seek truth and report it, empower the public to demand

accountability from the media and inspire all of us to fight back when the

powerful try to restrict the free flow of information.</font></p>
