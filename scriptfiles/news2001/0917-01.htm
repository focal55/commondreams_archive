- September 17 -  The Council on 

American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Washington-based Islamic 

advocacy group, today called on law enforcement authorities 

nationwide to step up protection of Muslim institutions and 

businesses following a spate of what appear to be anti-Muslim hate 

crimes related to the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, 

D.C. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In one weekend incident, a gunman killed the 49-year-old Sikh 

owner of a Mesa, Ariz. gas station. Family members of the victim 

believe he was killed because he looked &quot;Middle Eastern.&quot; (Sikhs 

are often mistaken for Muslims because they wear beards and 

turbans.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a second incident, a Dallas, Texas area Pakistani Muslim 

storeowner was shot and killed Saturday evening. FBI officials told 

representatives of CAIR's Dallas office that they are investigating 

the shooting as a bias-related crime. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just this morning, CAIR received reports of a vehicles being 

rammed into Islamic centers in Ohio and Indiana and a bomb going 

off at the Islamic Center of San Diego. CAIR has recorded several 

hundred incidents of anti-Muslim harassment, threats, 

discrimination and violence since the terrorist attacks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Muslims has received many messages of support from people of 

other faiths who abhor the anti-Islamic backlash that is now taking 

place. Unfortunately, the bigoted acts of a small minority are 

creating an atmosphere of apprehension and fear in the American 

Muslim community,&quot; said CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad. He 

called on President Bush and other elected officials to strengthen 

their statements rejecting anti-Muslim hysteria and discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad also urged that law enforcement officials not infringe on 

the civil liberties of American Muslims as they investigate the 

Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. &quot;We encourage any American who has 

information about these attacks to immediately contact the FBI. But 

innocent people who have nothing to do with these crimes should not 

be harassed or intimidated,&quot; said Awad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From &quot;What is Islam?&quot; -- &quot;Muslims follow a religion of peace, 

mercy and forgiveness that should not be associated with acts of 

violence against the innocent.&quot; SEE: <a href="http://www.cair-net.org/aboutislam.asp" target="_new">http://www.cair-net.org/aboutislam.asp</a> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are an estimated seven million Muslims in America and some 

1.2 billion worldwide. </font></p>
