<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 21 - A proposal by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is

unacceptable because it would severely limit or eliminate the public's ability to conduct

formal, trial-type hearings to oppose NRC reactor license applications, Public Citizen has

told the agency.

<p>In <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Press/pr-cmep148a.htm" target="_new">comments submitted to the NRC last week</a>, Public

Citizen was sharply critical of a rule being considered by the agency. Under the rule,

informal hearings &#150; with no opportunity for the public to conduct document discovery

(the compelled disclosure of documents) or to cross-examine witnesses &#150; would become

the default proceeding for virtually all licensing issues, including initial reactor

licensing, license extensions and license amendments for aging reactors. </p>



<p>Currently, formal meetings give the public an opportunity to question issues of design,

safety, radioactive waste, health and environmental impacts, routine radioactive releases,

and emergency preparedness of nuclear reactors that are proposed, under construction or

already built. Informal hearings limit the amount of information the public can obtain and

curtail their ability to get key documents about the issues at hand.</p>



<p>Under the new rule, citizens wishing to contest the license renewal of a local nuclear

reactor would have almost no time to request a formal hearing. Currently, groups wishing

to intervene in the licensing process (such as citizen groups, and state and local

governments) are given only a month to review the license application and formulate

&quot;contentions&quot; that describe and provide documentation for the concerns they wish

to contest. The new rule would require intervening parties to submit their contentions

almost immediately after the hearing notice is published; the number of days depends on

the kind of hearing. It would be unlikely that most intervenors would have the staff or

resources to adequately respond in such a short time.</p>



<p>In sharp contrast to the commission's proposal to squelch public opposition for reactor

licensing, industry enforcement hearings (held when a violation has occurred at a plant

and penalties are determined) will be maintained as formal proceedings, allowing the

industry to use the process to contest enforcement proceedings. The NRC's discriminatory

treatment between public and industry hearings on this aspect of the rule change is unjust

because it preserves due process for the industry but eliminates it for the public, Public

Citizen said.</p>



<p>This attempt to &quot;streamline&quot; the licensing process would further compromise

the commission's reputation and ability to be an effective regulator, and the proposed

rule would &quot;eliminate meaningful public participation and intervention in the

licensing hearing process to the exclusive benefit of the nuclear power industry,&quot;

Public Citizen said in its comments. The NRC's proposed actions are &quot;blatant

promotional activity&quot; for the nuclear industry, Public Citizen said.</p>



<p>&quot;Rather than fulfilling their mandate to build public confidence in the licensing

process, and protect public health and safety, the NRC is rolling over and treating the

nuclear industry as though it has a 'right' to any and all licenses,&quot; said Wenonah

Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program.

&quot;The recent tragic events have shown that America's nuclear plants could very well

provide 103 deadly targets to terrorists. The public really should have a right to formal

hearings to contest the licensing of any one of those radioactive targets.&quot;</p>



<p>The group's letter cited a 1987 report to the House Subcommittee on General Oversight

and Investigations, entitled &quot;NRC Coziness with Industry: Nuclear Regulatory

Commission Fails to Maintain Arms Length Relationship with the Nuclear Industry.&quot; The

subcommittee identified five significant instances in which the NRC failed to maintain a

proper regulatory distance from the industry. </p>



<p>&quot;This is just another example of the commission paving the way for the current

administration's nuclear 'relapse.' The more barriers they can remove in the licensing

process, the faster they can build new reactors and re-license the decaying ones,&quot;

said David Ritter, Public Citizen policy analyst. &quot;This would be a serious blow to

democratic processes within the agency, and if this proposal is not rejected in its

entirety, I would propose that the NRC drop any pretense of being a 'regulatory'

commission, and remove the word 'regulatory' from its name.&quot;</p>



<p>The NRC is expected to make a decision within a few months.</p></font>
