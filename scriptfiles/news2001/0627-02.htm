- Junee 27 -  Citing the illegal use of 

taxpayer dollars at the Northeastern Research Station's Fernow 

Experimental Forest, a national taxpayer organization today awarded 

the United States Forest Service the dubious honor of the Golden 

Fleece Award. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Either it's amateur hour at the Forest Service, or these 

employees knowingly chose to defraud taxpayers,&quot; commented Jonathan 

Oppenheimer, Director of the Forest Campaign at Taxpayers 

for Common Sense. &quot;Either way, it cost taxpayers millions of 

dollars.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) 

audit, the Fernow Experimental Forest, located in West Virginia, 

sold over nine million board feet of timber to three handpicked 

sawmills over a 12-year period. The forest collected $2.4 million 

from exclusive contracts with the sawmills, yet failed to report 

any of the revenue, as required by law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, the forest used the money to pay the Forest Service 

logging crews who logged, hauled, and decked the timber -- a clear 

violation of recognized laws and regulations. The forest also did 

not share any of the money with the State of West Virginia, as 

required by a well-established 1908 law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would be absurd to think that they didn't know the rules,&quot; 

continued Oppenheimer. &quot;Obviously, they were of the opinion that 

this was their own personal forest to manage for the 

exclusive gain of these local sawmills.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OIG audit recommends that the Forest Service repay the State 

of West Virginia the $341,541 it owes the state and return the 

remaining $2.05 million to the U.S. Treasury. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It will be difficult for the state of West Virginia and federal 

taxpayers to get their money back, since it has already been 

spent,&quot; continued Oppenheimer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, the OIG audit found that: 

-- The forest managers failed to follow established bidding 

procedures; 

-- The forest did not report the revenue generated from the 

timber sales and failed to share a portion of the receipts with the 

State of West Virginia, totaling $341,541; 

-- The forest illegally augmented congressional appropriations 

by retaining timber revenue to cover the salaries of the logging 

crew; 

-- The forest owes the U.S. Treasury over $2 million in revenue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The OIG also accused the Fernow Experimental Forest of bypassing 

the mission of the station, by abusing &quot;research&quot; activities. 

According to the OIG audit, &quot;the cited 1/8timber 3/8 sales did not 

constitute 'research' and the timber purchasers did not furnish 

data to further the Station's research programs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The public is going to have a hard time believing that a 

bargain basement sale of taxpayer-owned timber is a legitimate 

research program,&quot; said Oppenheimer. &quot;The only thing we learned 

here is that when nobody's paying attention, it is easy to rip off 

the government.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is only the second Golden Fleece award presented since 

1988, when Senator Proxmire retired from the Senate after 31 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the famous waste-busting 

award, former Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire last year asked 

Taxpayers for Common Sense to revive the Golden Fleece Award. 

Senator Proxmire is Honorary Chair of the group's Advisory 

Committee. Today's award is the second Golden Fleece awarded by the 

group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, American taxpayers have found a worthy heir to 

the title of the fleece in the actions of the Forest Service,&quot; 

concluded Oppenheimer. </font></p>
