Co-author of <I>Preventing a Biological Arms Race</I> and of the forthcoming book

<I>The Biological Warfare Problem: A Reappraisal for the 21st Century</I>,

Wright said today:"As the U.S. faces the threat of biological warfare at

home, calls for strengthening defenses against biological warfare are certainly

justified. But there is a deep contradiction in the U.S. position. Abroad, the

government -- under both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations -- has

pursued a unilateralist policy that has weakened the 1972 Biological Weapons

Convention, which bans biological and toxin weapons. This was done both

directly -- by supporting BW-related activities that undermine if not violate

the treaty -- and indirectly by diluting and ultimately rejecting a draft

Protocol designed to provide the treaty with an inspection regime.&quot;

Associate professor of political science at the University of Arizona and author of the article "Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion in Retrospect," Gibbs said today:

"The rise of bin Laden can be seen as 'blowback' from past failed U.S.

policies in Afghanistan. Not only did the CIA back the most extreme of all the

Islamic groups, but new evidence suggests that U.S. officials helped provoke

the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In a 1998 interview with <I>Le Nouvel

Observateur</I> in France, former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski

recounts that, contrary to the official version of events, CIA aid to the

mujahaddin guerrillas began six months before the invasion of Afghanistan --

with the anticipation that this would make a Soviet intervention more likely.

Brzezinski boasts about his role in 'drawing the Russians into the Afghan

trap.' When questioned about the wisdom of supporting Islamic fundamentalism,

Brzezinski offers a chilling dismissal: 'What is more important in world

history? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire?'

www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms</A><BR>

Hartung is senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute and author of "The New

Business of War." He said today: "Far from representing a 'new

approach,' the military actions being undertaken by the Bush administration --

engaging in massive bombing attacks, unleashing the CIA to permit

assassinations of foreign leaders and arming rebel groups to pressure regimes

that allegedly support terror groups -- are a collection of discredited

policies from the past. The Pentagon's current allies of convenience -- the

Northern Alliance -- had a dismal human rights record when they ruled

Afghanistan, and many residents of Kabul fear a return of the Northern Alliance

to power even more than they fear the current repressive policies of the

Taliban.... Putting a U.S. stamp of approval on brutal policies of 'coalition'

partners that will in all likelihood be carried out with U.S. arms is hardly a

way to increase our popularity or our security with the people of these countries."

This week, the <I>Sunday Times</I> of London reported that terrorists may have planned to use one of the planes on Sept. 11 "to bomb a nuclear power station." Wasserman,

author of <I>The Last Energy War</I> and co-author of <I>Killing Our

Own: The Disaster of America's Experience with Atomic Radiation</I>, said

today: "The planes that crashed into the WTC could have easily obliterated

the two atomic reactors now operating at Indian Point, about 40 miles up the Hudson,

or Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Had those jets instead hit such reactors,

an unimaginable holocaust could have occurred."
