- February 2 - The Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in Space has announced a

series of protests in 2001 that will begin on February 3 in Munich, Germany

and continue throughout the year.  The protests will highlight Pentagon

plans to deploy weapons in space.



<p>German peace groups will protest the visit of new U.S. Secretary of Defense

Donald Rumsfeld when he visits Munich, Germany on February 3.  Rumsfeld will

be meeting with European leaders at the Munich Conference for Security

Policy in order to build support for Star Wars.  The protest will be held at

the Promenadeplatz at 11:00 am.  "If the US continues with the

militarization and weaponization of space, other countries are sure to

follow.  We must stop this madness now. It's conflict prevention we must

work on, not expanding conflict to space," said Regina Hagen from Darmstadt,

Germany, a Board member of the Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear

Power in Space.





<p>On February 10 - 12 the Global Network will organize the following events in

Albuquerque:



<p>· Daily protest vigils at the 18th Annual Symposium on Space Nuclear Power &

Propulsion to be held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel (330 Tijeras NW) from

12:00 - 3:00 pm.  This annual conference of Air Force, NASA, DoE, aerospace

industry and nuclear academia promotes the expanded use of nuclear power for

space-based weapons and "civilian" space applications.



<p>"The Bush administration, the Pentagon, and their corporate allies are

pushing hard to move the arms race into space," stated Bruce Gagnon,

Coordinator of the Florida-based Global Network. "Albuquerque has several

installations that play a key role in this effort to nuclearize and

weaponize space, including Kirtland A.F.B.   We are building an

international movement to stop the destabilizing move by the U.S. to take

'control and domination' of space.  The recent appointment of long-time Star

Wars promoter Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense indicates this

dangerous intention to deploy space weapons."



<p>Another major event planned by the Global Network in 2001 will be the

National Space Organizing Conference & Protest on March 16-18 in Huntsville,

Alabama (headquarters for the Army's Theatre Missile Defense - TMD system).

The Global Network maintains that TMD, being sold to the public as a forward

deployed defensive system, is moving to the forefront as a first-deployment

option for the Bush administration and will be used to encircle China -

provoking it to build more nuclear weapons.



<p>"Ballistic missile defense systems are a Trojan horse, a way for the

military to get approval to deploy offensive weapons in space, the kind of

weapons being designed in Albuquerque and Huntsville.  The U.S. Space

Command intends to 'deny' other countries access to space.  In recent

Pentagon reports they have stated that they must have the weapons systems in

place that will enable them to 'negate' other countries' space assets.  The

space-based laser is now moving toward its test phase with the announcement

of a new test facility in Mississippi.  This talk about defending the U.S.

from missile attack is a hoax," Gagnon said.



<p>On May 4-6 the Global Network will hold its annual International Membership

Conference in Leeds, England and will organize a protest event at the U.S.

Menwith Hill (NMD ground relay station) in Yorkshire.  Menwith Hill is now

undergoing up-grades for Star Wars participation.  People are expected to

attend this event from  throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and North

America.



<p>On May 19 a major civil disobedience action will be held at Vandenberg AFB

in California by a coalition of groups in that state.  Vandenberg is the

launch site for all NMD tests.  Periodic attempts to non-violently occupy

the base will continue as the opposition movement against Star Wars grows.



<p>On October 13 an International Day of Protest to Stop the Militarization of

Space will be held at key U.S. military bases and aerospace facilities

throughout the world.  A similar day last year drew protests in 16

countries.  Many more are expected in 2001.  In addition, an International

Postcard Campaign has been initiated, calling on President Bush to back away

from Star Wars.



<p>Staff and board members of the Global Network have been holding local public

educational events throughout Europe, Asia and the United States for the

past nine years.  Scores of communities are now developing grassroots

campaigns to prevent plans to put weapons into space.
