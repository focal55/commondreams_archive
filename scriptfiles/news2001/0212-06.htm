- February 12 - The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a special part of America's natural

heritage that must be preserved for future generations. President Bush has

recently claimed that opening this small, pristine portion of the Arctic to

oil and gas development will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and ease

California's energy woes.

<p>

But evidence from energy experts and scientists proves the opposite: The

amount of oil estimated to be in the refuge is just a fraction of our

yearly consumption and California, which generates less than one percent of

its electricity from oil, is facing a generation shortage, not an oil

shortage. Opening the refuge, even according to some oil producers, will

have no effect on oil prices because the supply is too small and Persian

Gulf oil too cheap.

<p>

Though the energy benefits of drilling in the refuge are nonexistent, the

environmental damage will be severe: Drilling in the refuge will decimate

one of our nation's most important wilderness areas and threaten habitat

used by hundreds of animals -- all for a six-month supply of oil. Just as

we wouldn't flood the Grand Canyon for hydropower or cap Old Faithful for

geothermal energy, we shouldn't drill for oil in the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge.

<p>

Background

<p>

+ According to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, there is less than 3.2

billion barrels of economically recoverable oil under the coastal plain of

the Arctic Refuge -- the equivalent of a six-month supply of oil for the

United States.

<p>

+ Because the amount of oil estimated to be in the refuge is so small in

comparison to world petroleum supplies, it will have no effect on world oil

prices.

<p>

+ Due to the complexity of drilling in the Arctic, the oil would not be

available for 7-10 years.

<p>

+ Ninety-five percent of Alaska's oil-bearing North Slope is open to oil

and gas exploration and leasing. The coastal plain of the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge is the last five percent of Alaska's North Slope that

remains off-limits to oil drilling.

<p>

+ The Arctic Refuge itself is 19 million acres. But, the coastal plain of

the Arctic Refuge -- the part that conservationists are working to protect

and that oil companies want to drill -- is just 1.5 million acres, or less

than the half the size of Connecticut.

<p>

Why Protect the Refuge?

<p>

+ The Arctic Refuge is a unique and pristine wilderness area that is

crucial both to native people and a huge range of wildlife. According to

the Department of Interior: The Coastal plain "is the most biologically

productive part of the Arctic Refuge for wildlife and is the center of

wildlife activity."

<p>

* The Coastal plain of the Refuge is most famously known for the annual

migration of the 129,000-member Porcupine River Caribou herd. Each spring,

the Porcupine Caribou migrate over 400 miles to reach the coastal plain of

the Arctic Refuge to give birth to their young in the same place, year

after year.

<p>

* For almost 20,000 years, this awesome migration has sustained the

Gwich'in Natives, who view the coastal plain as sacred and whose

traditional lifestyle depends on Caribou for food, clothing and medicine.

<p>

* The Refuge is the most important on-shore polar bear denning area in the

United States and is also home to many unique and important animals

including Grizzly bears and Dall sheep, Musk oxen, arctic foxes and

wolverines.

<p>

* Hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, representing more than 130

species, make stopovers on trips from as far away as the Baja Peninsula,

the Chesapeake Bay and even Antarctica to use the coastal plain as a

breeding- and nesting-ground.

<p>

+ The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that we should protect

special wild places like the Arctic Refuge for our children as part of our

American heritage.

<p>

"Clean" Drilling is a Fantasy

<p>

+ Though new drilling and exploration techniques may be less harmful than

past practices, oil production is an inherently messy business and "clean"

drilling is still a fantasy.

<p>

+ Proponents of drilling in the Arctic claim that instead of scooping tons

of gravel from fragile stream beds, they will be able to build roads made

out of ice. But, in certain areas of the Arctic Refuge where not enough

water is available, gravel roads will still have to be constructed.

<p>

+ According to a recent article in The  New York Times Science Times  (Jan.

30), new computer-based exploration techniques, though they improve the

probability of hitting oil, can actually worsen environmental impacts

because they require caravans of one hundred or more vehicles (some of

which weigh up to 10 tons) to criss-cross the fragile tundra looking for

oil. Polar bears are extremely sensitive to disturbances during the winter

and have been know to abandon their young when heavy equipment moves into

an area.

<p>

+ Regardless of the technological improvements to oil exploration, drilling

and producing the oil still requires a massive maze of pipelines and roads

along with fuel dumps, waste treatment facilities, gravel pits and other

infrastructure.

<p>

+ And no matter how much we improve all of these techniques, oil

exploration inevitable results in spills. On January 16, Alaska's North

Slope saw yet another major oil-related mishap when 20,000 gallons of

drilling "mud" -- a petroleum based lubricant used to ease the drill bit's

path through the Earth -- spilled from one of Prudhoe Bay's newest

facilities.

<p>

Prudhoe Bay Pollution Looms Large

<p>

+ Prudhoe Bay averages over one spill a day of petroleum or other hazardous

waste -- in 1996 there were 427 spills.

<p>

+ Prudhoe Bay, once called the height of responsible drilling, is home to

an industrial complex so large, astronauts report seeing it clearly from

space.

<p>

+ Oil and gas drilling in Prudhoe Bay currently creates 43,000 tons of

nitrogen oxides a year -- twice as much air pollution as the city of

Washington DC.

<p>

Instead of Drilling the Arctic, Raise CAFE, Increase Efficiency, Invest in

Renewables

<p>

Instead of drilling in the Arctic, we could find a new source of oil by

raising automobile and light-truck fuel-economy standards, increasing the

energy efficiency of our homes and investing more in renewable sources of

electricity, like wind- and solar-power.

<p>

+ If we increased fuel economy standards by just 6 percent each year, in

the decade that it would take for oil from the Arctic Refuge to become

available, we could be saving 1.1 billion barrels of oil annually. That's

more oil than we import from the entire Persian Gulf and within three years

of full implementation would equal the total amount of recoverable oil

estimated to be in the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain.

<p>

Increasing the efficiency of our homes could also do much to cut the use of

heating oil, but, in the long term, only renewable sources of energy, like

solar and wind-power, will give us stable, clean and plentiful energy.
