- April 9 -  Farmers and ranchers nationwide got a nasty shock in today's

release of the federal budget for 2002: The Bush administration

proposes to drastically cut funding for agriculture conservation

and farmland protection efforts. Programs to be zeroed out

include those that offer farmers incentives to protect water

supplies, create wildlife habitat on farmland, and permanently

protect their farmland from sprawling development.

<p>The programs being cut, including the Wildlife Habitat

Incentives Program, Farmland Protection Program, Wetlands

Reserve Program and others, comprised less than 4 percent of

total farm spending of $32 billion in fiscal year 2001. That

relatively modest amount of funding was overwhelmed by requests

for assistance: For the program that encourages farmers to

restore wetlands alone, known as WRP, three out of every four

farmers requesting assistance were rejected.

<p>"At a time when the world is getting a much clearer view of

the many links between good conservation practices, food,

farmland and quality of life, funding these conservation

programs is more important than ever," pointed out Ann Sorensen,

head of research at AFT's Center for Agriculture in the

Environment at Northern Illinois University. "America's farmers

aim to be good stewards, but we cannot tell them that they must

carry the entire burden of providing environmental benefits for

us all."

<p>The state and local impact will be even more extreme for some

programs. The Farmland Protection Program, for example, provides

up to a 50 percent match for state and local efforts to

permanently protect farmland. A combination of funding streams

allocated $17.5 million to FPP for this federal fiscal year.

However, from January through March of this year alone the FPP

received requests for more than $116 million in matching funds

from farmers and ranchers willing to protect their land.

<p>If fully funded, this year's requests would have leveraged

$186 million dollars of state and local money and protected

more than 770 farms. A total elimination of funding, as proposed

in next year's budget, shuts the door on the opportunity to

leverage funding from states and localities to meet national

goals.

<p>"These cuts will hamstring local, state and federal agencies

working with landowners to protect critical farm and ranch lands

from development," explained Ralph Grossi, president of American

Farmland Trust. "While the administration claims to want to help

protect private property rights, they are essentially stripping

landowners of the right to protect their land from development."

<p>The cuts appear to contradict action at the state and local

level. Voters approved more than $7 billion in spending related

to environmental and land use issues at the ballot box last

fall. And more and more states are using conservation easements

to preserve their best agricultural lands because easements

protect land, property rights and the local tax base: The number

of states offering state-wide easement programs has grown from

nine to 20 since 1990.

<p>The budget now goes to the congressional committees that

write annual spending bills for USDA.

<p>"I find it hard to believe that the administration doesn't

realize how powerful an economic and environmental tool they

have in these conservation programs," said Grossi. "Americans

have made it clear they want to get more environmental benefits

from farmland and control over sprawling development and its

spiraling costs for communities -- and these are federal

programs that can deliver on that demand."

<p><i>American Farmland Trust is a private, nonprofit farmland

conservation organization founded in 1980 to stop the loss of

productive farmland and to promote farming practices that lead

to a healthy environment, Its action-oriented programs include

public education, technical assistance in policy development and

demonstration farmland protection projects. For more
