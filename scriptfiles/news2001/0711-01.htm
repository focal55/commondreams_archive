- July 11 -  U.S. anti-drug money

spent on Latin America has been funneled through corrupt

military, paramilitary and intelligence organizations and ends

up violating basic human rights, a new Center for Public

Integrity investigation shows.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The investigation by the Center's International Consortium of

Investigative Journalists found that in three of the Latin

American countries examined, U.S. aid was implicated in civilian

human rights abuses. Other findings:</font>

</font>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The $1.3 billion Plan Colombia aid package represents the

largest American commitment in a guerrilla war since Vietnam.

With the drug war's focus on leftist guerrillas, successive U.S.

administrations have tolerated the Colombian military's ties to

right-wing forces, even though they, too, are steeped in drugs.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Peru, the CIA paid at least $10 million to spymaster

Vladimiro Montesinos, who also diverted U.S. high-tech

surveillance equipment to spy on political opponents. Montesinos

betrayed his American benefactors by arming Colombia's FARC

guerrillas.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICIJ investigation reveals human rights abuses by

members of the elite Mexican special forces unit known as GAFE,

many of whose troops are trained by the United States. As in

South America, U.S. assistance to the Mexican military ends up

as dual use - to counter drugs and to deal with internal

security matters.

</font></li>

</ul>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. officials are particularly concerned about regional

stability in Latin America, which ships more oil to the United

States than the Persian Gulf. Major U.S. corporations with Latin

American interests spent more than $92 million lobbying the U.S.

Congress in the latter half of the 1990s, in part to affect U.S.

policy in the region.
