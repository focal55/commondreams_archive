- May 4 -  Statement of Tiernan Sittenfeld, U.S. PIRG Conservation Advocate</font>

            

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By announcing that 

              it will modify the forests rule, the Bush Administration is caving 

              to the special interests yet again rather than protecting our national 

              forests. The Administration has said it plans to allow a rule to 

              protect our national forest roadless areas to go

              forward, but that it will give local officials power to modify the 

              plan on a case by case basis. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s announcement 

              is expected to publicly give lip service to protecting our national 

              forests while quietly reopening them to chainsaws and bulldozers. 

              Local control by the timber industries for the last hundred years 

              has resulted in more than 380,000 miles of roads in our national 

              forests, a roads maintenance backlog of $8.6 billion, and millions 

              of

              acres of devastated national forests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rulemaking process 

              took more than two years to complete, during which time local people 

              spoke at 600 public meetings held on each national forest across 

              the country. A record-breaking 1.6 million people submitted comments 

              on the plan, more than 95% of which were strongly in support of 

              a strong protection plan. In addition, a new national poll shows 

              that 67% of voters favor the forest protection policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This policy is already 

              balanced. The new roadless rule is a balanced plan that protects 

              31% of our national forests while leaving more than half of them 

              open to logging, mining, and drilling. It allows access for recreational 

              vehicles and allows existing oil and gas leases to continue. The 

              rule already allows for many decisions to be made at the local

              level, including maintaining existing roads, building roads to fight 

              catastrophic wildfires, and cutting dense underbrush and small fire-prone 

              trees to reduce the risk of fire. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of Congress, 

              religious organizations, scientists, economists, environmental groups, 

              and the American people have all urged President Bush to protect 

              our national forests by implementing the roadless rule. We urge 

              the President to reverse his present

course and fully and immediately implement this historic conservation 

              rule as it is written. The American public will remember his decision 

              for generations to come.&quot; </font></p>
