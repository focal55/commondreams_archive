- May 7 -  "My grandfathers fled European serfdom to become self-employed

farmers. Their achievement is threatened far more by concentration

of

wealth in the United States than by estate taxes." -- Robert Rohwer,

Iowa farmer

<p>WHAT: Rally to preserve the estate tax

<p>WHEN: Thursday, May 10 at Noon

<p>WHERE: "The Swamp" on Capitol grounds, off Constitution Ave.

between the Capitol and Russell Senate Office Building

<p>WHO: Sponsored by Responsible Wealth

and Nonprofits for Preserving the Estate Tax

<p>SPEAKERS INCLUDE:

<p>-- William H. Gates, Sr., co-chair, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates

Foundation

<br>

"While we may not be able to ensure that all children start their

lives on a level playing field, that is something we should strive

for, and the estate tax keeps us closer to that ideal."

<p>-- Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president, Children's

Defense Fund

<br>

"I hope that Congress will wait until hungry children are fed,

homeless children are housed, and all children have health insurance

before seeking to repeal the estate tax for the wealthiest few in

America."

<p>-- Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), ranking member on the Budget

Committee, member of Finance Committee

<p>-- Robert Rohwer, Iowa farmer since 1951. Will pass on his farm to

his son.

<p>WHY NOW: The Senate Finance Committee is discussing President

Bush's tax cut proposal and whether to eliminate the estate tax or

to

modify it. The estate tax affects only the richest 2 percent in

America. The repeal would help create an aristocracy of wealth and

a

shortfall of revenues for education, health care, the environment and

children's programs.

<p><i>Responsible Wealth is a network of business leaders, investors and



other affluent Americans seeking to reduce economic inequality in the



United States. United for a Fair Economy is a national nonprofit



organization founded in 1994 to focus public attention on income and



wealth inequality.
