- January 22 - The Bush administration has moved to delay the effective date of

all new federal regulations, including a landmark EPA plan to clean

up big-rig diesel trucks, buses and diesel fuel.

<p>The delay, announced Jan. 20, is ostensibly to permit new

appointed officials to review rules such as the diesel clean-up

plan. At her confirmation hearing last week, New Jersey Gov.

Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA administrator-designate, noted that

the Bush administration would review the clean diesel rule. It

remains unclear if the administration aims to revise the rule.

<p>What would be the impact of any rollback?

<p>When fully in effect, the EPA plan would prevent 8,300 premature

deaths each year, as well as 5,500 annual cases of chronic

bronchitis and 17,600 cases of acute bronchitis in children,

according to EPA's regulatory impact analysis.

<p>The EPA plan also would prevent over 360,000 asthma attacks and

more than 386,000 cases of respiratory symptoms in asthmatic

children annually. In addition, it would prevent 1.5 million lost

work days, 7,100 hospital admissions and 2,400 emergency room

visits for asthma every year. In addition, the plan would improve

visibility, reduce acid rain, and reduce eutrophication and

nitrification of water bodies.

<p>EPA calculated that the diesel cleanup would cost about $4.2

billion per year -- but would produce more than $70 billion dollars

in annual benefits by reducing exposure to smog, soot and toxic air

contaminants.

<p>"Given the massive health benefits of the diesel cleanup, it

would be a terrible blunder for the new administration to weaken or

delay these new standards," noted Frank O'Donnell, executive

director of the Clean Air Trust.
