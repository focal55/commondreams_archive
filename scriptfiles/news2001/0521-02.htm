- May 21 -  As diplomats gather

in Stockholm this week to sign a global chemicals treaty, World

Wildlife Fund is urging governments to quickly ratify the

convention that will help protect wildlife and people throughout

the world from toxic contamination.

<p>WWF is calling on governments to ratify the Stockholm POPs

Convention within the next year, prior to the World Summit on

Sustainable Development in September 2002. The treaty requires

ratification by 50 countries before it can enter into force.

Finalized last December by a consensus of 122 countries, the new

treaty bans or severely restricts a group of 12 pesticides and

industrial chemicals, including PCBs, dioxins, and DDT. These

dangerous chemicals, known as persistent organic pollutants or

POPs, are extremely toxic, accumulate in body fat, do not readily

degrade in the enviroment, and have the ability to travel great

distances.

<p>"The POPs Convention is critically important to safeguard the

health of wildlife and people everywhere on Earth," said Clifton

Curtis, director of WWF's Global Toxic Chemicals Initiative.

"Governments should waste no time in ratifying the treaty so

implementation can proceed as soon as possible."

<p>While most of the targeted chemicals have already been banned in

industrialized countries, implementation of the treaty faces some

challenges in the developing world due to inadequate resources and

regulatory structures, continued use of some of the pesticide POPs,

and a need for environmentally sound disposal and destruction of

obsolete POPs stockpiles.

<p>"Developing countries will require significant finanical and

technical support from the developed world to successfully

implement the treaty's provisions," said Brooks Yeager, WWF's vice

president for Global Threats. "POPs are a global threat so it is in

the best interest of the United States and other wealthy nations to

ensure that the treaty's goals are realized." During the

negotiations, Yeager was the U.S. government's chief negotiator on

the POPs Treaty as the State Department's deputy assistant

secretary for the environment.

<p>The Stockholm POPs Convention enjoys wide support from

governments, the chemical industry, and environmental groups. Once

in force, the treaty will eliminate or severely restrict production

and use of this group of pesticides and industrial chemicals;

ensure environmentally sound management and chemical transformation

of POPs waste; establish a process for screening other chemicals

for inclusion in the treaty; and prevent the emergence of new

chemicals with POPs-like characteristics.
