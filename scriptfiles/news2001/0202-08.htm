- February 2 - While governors from 10 western states met with federal officials in 

Portland, Ore., today to discuss the regional energy crisis, critics in 

California and the Pacific Northwest were calling for fundamental changes 

in government policies on electric power generation. The following policy 

analysts are available for interviews:</font>

The director of the Green Power Project at the Portland-based organization 

Northwest Environmental Advocates, Rosolie said this afternoon: &quot;It's 

unfortunate that elected officials failed to see the warning signs of this 

energy crisis months ago. Friday's conference will amount to nothing more 

than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. The real losers in this 

will be the consumers and the environment. The discussion that the 

governors need to have is about who owns generating resources, not merely 

how to build them faster. As long as resources are owned by private 

companies, be they utilities or the likes of Enron, consumers will always 

lose... Every new plant that is built that burns fossil fuel will add to 

the ever-growing problem of global warming. Any decision about our energy 

future without consideration of the environmental impacts -- especially 

global warming and climate change -- is shortsighted and not in the public interest.&quot;</font></p>

Benjamin, a spokesperson for the Coalition Against Utility Rate Hikes, said 

Friday afternoon: &quot;We are at a crossroads in the power crisis. In 

California, the legislators are caught between a path that will lead to the 

bailout of the utility companies at taxpayer and ratepayer expense, and a 

solution that will lead to the protection of consumers and greater public 

control of our energy system. Governor Gray Davis and the legislators have 

strong ties to the power companies, which have not only given them large 

campaign contributions but also have a legion of lobbyists who are helping 

them craft legislation. On the other hand are our consumer and community 

groups with meager staff and little access to the decision-makers, but with 

sensible solutions to this crisis... We should require the utility 

companies to use the profits and assets of all their divisions and holding 

companies to pay their own debts. No more bailouts! Public monies should 

not be spent to buy stock options in mismanaged utility companies, but to 

buy assets for the generation and transmission of power. Since the 

privately owned utility companies have proven themselves incapable of 

supplying a reliable, affordable source of energy to the people of 

California, our goal should be to move toward public ownership of power. 

The well-run municipal utilities that exist all over the state prove the 

benefits of public power.&quot;</font></p>
