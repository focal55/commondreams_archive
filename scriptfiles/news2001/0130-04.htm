- January 30 -  To avoid exposure to hazardous levels of lead, consumers should

stop buying candles with metal wicks and should not burn the ones they have, Public

Citizen said today. Burning lead-wicked candles for three hours can lead to average air

lead concentrations ranging from 10 to 36 times higher than permitted by the Environmental

Protection Agency, according to research conducted last year by Public Citizen and

published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last July.

<p>&quot;Because there is no reliable way to know whether a candle with a metal wick

contains lead, the only way to ensure that you are not exposed to lead from candles is to

simply not buy metal-wicked candles,&quot; said Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Health Research Group. &quot;If you have bought such candles, we urge you

not to light them or to return them to the store unless there is clear proof that they do

not contain significant quantities of lead.&quot;</p>



<p>In 1973, Public Citizen petitioned the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to ban

lead-wicked candles. The agency denied the petition, relying instead on a voluntary

agreement with the candle industry to stop making lead-wicked candles. By the late 1970s,

however, the manufacture and sale of lead-wicked candles resumed, exposing millions of

children<b> </b>to the well-documented neurological and developmental dangers of lead.</p>



<p>Consequently, on Feb. 24, 2000, Public Citizen again petitioned the CPSC to ban

lead-wicked candles and order a recall of all metal-wicked candles. On Dec. 13, 2000, CPSC

staff members recommended that lead-wicked candles be banned. The staff did not address

the issue of a recall. CPSC commissioners will meet at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 30, at the

CPSC offices at 4330 East-West Highway in Bethesda, Maryland, to consider the staff&#146;s

recommendation.</p>



<p>Even if the CPSC votes to grant Public Citizen&#146;s petition, it could still be years

before the rulemaking process is completed. In a Jan. 25 letter, Public Citizen urged the

CPSC to speed up the process.</p>



<p>&quot;Lead in candles is a completely unnecessary and avoidable source of lead

poisoning,&quot; said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Health

Research Group. &quot;There can be no excuse for snail&#146;s-pace rulemaking or for

leaving these hazardous products on the market in the meantime.&quot;###</p>
