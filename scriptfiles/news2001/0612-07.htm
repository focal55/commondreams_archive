- June 12 - The Bush Administration's 

decision today to force California to use ethanol as a replacement 

for the gas additive MTBE will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions 

of dollars in additional ethanol subsidies and will be a new 

billion-dollar cash cow for one of America's largest agricultural 

giants, according to a leading critic of corporate welfare. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To comply with federal requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act 

of 1990, California will need more than 580 million gallons of 

ethanol. Currently, the industry receives a 55-cent tax break per 

gallon of ethanol produced. Today's decision will mean a new $320 

million subsidy, bringing total ethanol subsidies to more than $1 

billion per year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This decision is 100 percent Grade-A political pandering to 

Archer Daniels Midland and the farm lobby,&quot; said Keith Ashdown, 

spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS). &quot;You would think 

that this was an election year by the size of this new handout.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), a politically powerful company 

based in Decatur, Illinois, would benefit most from the new ethanol 

windfall -- not small family farmers in the Midwest, according to 

the group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This decision flies in the face of the Administration's 

rhetoric on cutting corporate welfare,&quot; continued Ashdown. &quot;The 

cold, hard truth is that this is yet another politically motivated 

handout to a powerful special interest.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADM is one of the biggest agricultural companies in the world 

with more than $14 billion in sales last year. ADM also controls 

over 55 percent of the U.S. ethanol market. If all 16 states where 

MTBE is now used were required by EPA to use ethanol instead, total 

demand for ethanol would more than double. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The California decision sets a horrible precedent that 

taxpayers and consumers at the pump should pay more so that 

profitable companies like Archer Daniels Midland can make even 

more,&quot; said Ashdown. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed switch from MTBE to ethanol highlights the 

political power of the farm lobby and ADM. ADM has given about $5 

million in contributions to federal lawmakers since 1991. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The saying 'give and you shall receive' seems appropriate 

today,&quot; concluded Ashdown, &quot;ADM gives millions in political 

contributions and is getting hundreds of millions worth of subsidies 

in return.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS) is an independent advocate for 

the American taxpayer. TCS is dedicated to cutting wasteful 

spending and subsidies in order to achieve a more responsible and 

efficient government that lives within its means. </i></font></p>
