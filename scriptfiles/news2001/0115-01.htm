- January 15 - In the spirit of the prophetic legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., diverse religious leaders gathered in Washington to raise serious concerns about Attorney General nominee Senator John Ashcroft's record on religious liberty, civil rights and, his willingness to uphold laws that directly contradict his deeply held personal religious beliefs as a Pentecostal Christian.  



<p>"We are not opposing or supporting Senator Ashcroft, we have questions that must be addressed during this week's hearings," said the <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/Directors/directors.htm" target="_blank">Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy</a>, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance at the morning press conference.  "Religious liberty is vital and integral to the health of our democracy and we must know that if confirmed to the post of Attorney General, he will vigorously defend this constitutionally guaranteed principle."



<p>Dr. Sushil Jain, spokesperson, Federation of Jain Associations in North America and Association of United Hindu and Jain Temples of Metro Washington, Imam Ghayth Nur Kashif,  Masjidush-Shura, Washington, DC, 	Sumeet Kaur, Associate Director, Sikh Mediawatch and Resource Task Force, Rabbi Jack Moline, Agudas Achim Congregation of Northern Virginia, and The Rev. James Brent Walker, Executive Director, Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs all joined The Interfaith Alliance to raise questions for Senator Ashcroft.  



<p>Calling on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to conduct hearings on the controversial nominee this week, the religious leaders spoke of the necessity of clarifying Senator Ashcroft's interpretation of the constitutional guarantees of religious liberty, as well as the contradiction in some of his public statements, his position on hate crimes, charitable choice legislation, and secret evidence laws among other issues. 

<p>While strongly defending and affirming Senator Ashcroft's right to express his personal religious beliefs, Rabbi Jack Moline, rabbi of Agudus Achim Congregation in Alexandria and member of The Interfaith Alliance Board of Directors, spoke directly to the current attempts to portray critics of Senator Ashcroft's political positions as secular enemies of religion. 



<p>"I caution against the rhetoric of public figures who blur the line between politics and religion by making Senator Ashcroft's nomination a holy crusade," stated Rabbi Moline, "Because the covenant of America is a covenant of law… we must be convinced that he will use the law itself as the standard of conduct, and only the law itself."



<p>Raising concerns from minority religious perspectives, questions were posed on whether or not Senator Ashcroft will prevent public institutions such as the local, state and federal courts or the nation's public schools from imposing a majority religious tradition through activities such as organized school prayer. 



<p>"Does Senator Ashcroft believe the courts currently take the separation clause too far?" questioned Sumeet Kaur, associate director of the Sikh Mediawatch and Resource Task Force. "This must be answered, will he personally be able to enforce laws to which he has a principled disagreement?"



<p>The controversy and debate about Senator Ashcroft's nomination and his conservative political record have divided the nation and the faith community.  According to a poll released by Newsweek on January 13th, 40 percent of Americans believe that Senator Ashcroft's positions are out of step with the mainstream.  

 

<p>In an effort to see that these questions are answered during the hearings, The Interfaith Alliance has sent letters to all members of the United States Senate and is mobilizing networks of faith communities across the country to raise similar questions to their representatives in the United Senate as the hearings begin this week.
