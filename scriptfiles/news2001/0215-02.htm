- February 15 - Two new publications from Scenic America, From Sprawl to Smart Growth: How to Achieve Beautiful Results and Taming Wireless Telecommunications Towers, are now available to help citizens advocate for smart growth that is attractive and the sensitive siting of wireless telecommunications towers. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Visual quality is a basic building block for healthy, vibrant, and productive communities.  We take pride in where we live and work when these places are attractive and well-designed.  One of the problems with sprawl development is that it is ugly. Car-clogged asphalt, faceless cookie-cutter architecture, treeless housing developments, and an expanding network of giant, new telecommunications towers rob places of their scenic beauty and distinctive character.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;As Americans across the country search for &#145;America the Beautiful,&#146; they&#146;re encountering a very different reality,&#148; said Meg Maguire, president of Scenic America.  &#147;Everywhere is becoming nowhere and it all looks the same.  Change is inevitable, but ugliness is not.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Smart growth initiatives recognize the relationship between development patterns and quality of life, helping communities develop policies to balance economic vitality and environmental stewardship.  From Sprawl to Smart Growth shows how citizens can implement smart growth strategies through activities such as community education, voluntary measures, incentives, land or easement acquisition, and regulatory action. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Taming Wireless Telecommunications Towers informs communities of the options they have when advocating for the sensitive placement of towers and provides model legislation and examples of tower ordinances from across the country.  Taming Wireless Telecommunications Towers illustrates how to craft an ordinance that limits the visual impact of towers on the local landscape while still promoting wireless technology. </font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is important for communities to understand that they have a wide range of options for combating sprawl development and unnecessary intrusions on their visual environment,&#148; said Maguire.  &#147;Citizens need to examine what they want their community to look like in 10 or 15 years and work with local politicians, business owners, and civic leaders to build a community that residents and visitors alike are proud of.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Taming Wireless Telecommunications Towers is available for only $8.00 plus shipping and handling by visiting Scenic America&#146;s website at www.scenic.org or by calling Scenic America at (202) 543-6200 to order by phone.* </font></p>
