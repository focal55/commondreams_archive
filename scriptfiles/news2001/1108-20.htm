<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON  - November 8 - Neither the $67 billion Senate Finance Committee bill released 

today nor the $100 billion House version would be as effective in 

stimulating economic recovery as the alternatives in United for a 

Fair Economy's new website, <a href="http://www.RecoveryWatchdog.org" target="_new">www.RecoveryWatchdog.org</a>. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At this time of national crisis, we don't have the time or 

money to waste throwing bones to corporate campaign donors. Perhaps 

a better name for the Senate bill would be the &quot;Assistance for 

American Corporations Act,&quot; says Chris Hartman, Research Director 

of United for a Fair Economy. &quot;It spends more on business tax 

breaks than on any single real stimulus measure. All its relief 

measures for workers and individual taxpayers are too small to be 

effective.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, the 13-week extension of unemployment benefits 

would likely run out long before the recession is over. While some 

of the extremist measures in the House bill are thankfully missing 

from the Senate bill (such as the Alternative Minimum Tax repeal 

and capital gains tax cut), others remain, including a smaller 

expansion of depreciation allowances. The tax breaks for investment 

in lower Manhattan would do little besides line Wall Street 

pockets. Over $23 billion of the bill's $67 billion 2002 price tag 

goes to corporate welfare. The full Senate is expected to vote on 

the bill next week. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of <a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org/" target="_new">UFE's Responsible Wealth (RW) project</a>, who are in the 

top 5 percent of wealth or income, have doubts about the investment 

incentives in the Senate bill. &quot;The sponsors of these bills are 

either naive about how business incentives work or just captive to 

cynical, self-serving special interests,&quot; said Amy Domini, founder 

of the $1.1 billion Domini Social Equity mutual fund. &quot;Accelerated 

depreciation and operating loss carrybacks won't do anything to 

boost consumer demand for everyday items like sofas, storm windows, 

and snow blowers. Getting money into consumers' hands fast is the 

only way to create jobs and lead us out of recession.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UFE's <a href="http://www.RecoveryWatchdog.org" target="_new">www.RecoveryWatchdog.org</a> website asks taxpayers to submit 

comments on how they would allocate $100 billion, the cost of the 

House bill. The website will be one-stop-shopping for analysis of 

all proposed industry bailouts and economic recovery bills in terms 

of their effects on consumers, workers, and taxpayers. The 

alternatives on the site include an original proposal for a better 

airline bailout bill based on distributing travel vouchers to 

American households. </font></p>
