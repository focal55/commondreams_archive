- June 25 - The Supreme Court's opinion today is good news for the American people and good news for the future of campaign finance reform efforts. Just as it did last year in upholding contribution limits, the Court today in FEC v. Colorado Republican Party has once again recognized that Congress can act - consistent with the First Amendment - to protect the integrity of our politics by regulating big money. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Court gets it. The Court's majority understands that large donors are trying to buy, in the Court's words, &quot;obligated officeholders.&quot; As Common Cause argued in our amicus brief, parties can be used, in the Court's words, &quot;as conduits for contributions meant to place candidates under obligation.&quot; And because of this corruption, the Court will allow Congress to impose rules on money in politics in order to protect the integrity of our government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although this decision isn't directly about soft money, the same reasoning the Court used to sustain the party limits today will also sustain a ban on soft money. The Court upheld the party spending limit in order to prevent evasion of the limits on contributions from donors to candidates. The soft money system is the mother of all evasions, a system which has totally undermined the contribution limits enacted by Congress in the wake of Watergate. Just as Congress can limit party spending to prevent evasion, it can surely ban soft money as well, to prevent an even more massive and dangerous form of evasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents of reform like Senator Mitch McConnell and Majority Whip Tom DeLay like to use constitutional smokescreens to try to defeat reform. Their fantastic claims that it violates the Constitution for Congress to protect all of us from the corrupting influence of big money have been dealt another fatal blow. This decision is a loud repudiation of the extreme views advanced in this area by those opposed to campaign finance reform in Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are no more excuses. The House should pass the Shays-Meehan reform bill and send it to President Bush for his signature.</font></p>
