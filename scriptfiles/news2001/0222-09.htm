- February 22 - Human rights advocates and experts from across the U.S., Indonesia and 

elsewhere will gather this weekend in Washington, DC, at the inaugural 

conference of the Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN). Hendardi, a 

leading human rights activist and Chairman of the Jakarta-based PBHI (The 

Indonesian Legal Aid and Human Rights Association) will give the keynote 

address at the conference. Many conference speakers will be available for 

interviews.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference -- to be held at George Washington University, February 23 &shy; 

February 25  --will feature lectures, panel discussions and strategy 

sessions on promoting human rights and democracy in the troubled Indonesian 

archipelago.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With events moving swiftly in Indonesia, a network like ours becomes 

especially necessary,&quot; said Lynn Fredriksson, Interim Coordinator. &quot;We plan 

to press the new U.S. administration and other policy makers to support 

human rights, civilian control of the military, and rule of law in 

Indonesia. With military-backed repression escalating, the Government of 

Indonesia should receive no U.S. military assistance. The peoples of 

Indonesia must be free to make their own economic and political choices,&quot; 

she added.</font></p>

East Timor?&quot;); Wiwiek Awiati (Jakarta-based environmental lawyer); Jeff
