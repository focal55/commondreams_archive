- May 2 - The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) called today's passage of an amendment to the State Department Authorization bill (H.R. 1646) a victory for people and wildlife worldwide.  The amendment, which was introduced by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) and passed in the House International Relations Committee, called for the repeal of the restrictions President Bush placed on international family planning assistance his first day in office.  These restrictions make it harder for women and families worldwide to obtain vital family planning services, and will have serious impacts on the global environment.

<p>"Today's passage of Rep. Lee's amendment is a victory for people and wildlife around the world.  International family planning funding is crucial to helping the global environment," said NWF population and environment program manager Karin Krchnak.  "The exponential increase in population over the past century has put enormous stress on natural resources and habitat, threatening the health of both people and wildlife worldwide.  It is only with access to education that people will be able to ensure a healthy world for themselves and future generations."</p>

<p>The State Department Authorization bill (H.R. 1646) will proceed to the House floor in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>"Americans will be looking to Congress to protect the health of their environment at home and abroad," continued Krchnak.  "It will be up to the House of Representatives to take the next step to ensure that people around the world will have access to the education and services that are so crucial to protecting the health of our planet."	It has been shown time and again that when couples have access to family planning services, they tend to choose to have smaller, healthier families.  By having smaller families, we can ease the demand for water and arable land, preserve biodiversity and vital habitat, and limit pollution – improving the prospects for a healthy world. 

<p>	NWF is working to develop support for U.S. international assistance programs aimed at ensuring access to educational materials for families, training for clinical and health care providers, improvements in girls' education, and improving the status and public participation of women worldwide.  Restrictions to the international family funding bill interferes with these activities, endangers women's lives, and impacts our ability to create a more sustainable environment.</p>

<p>Along with increased use of natural resources, growing world population is a major cause of destruction of the environment.  In 1999, the world population reached six billion, and if current rates continue, it will reach 12 billion by the middle of the 21st century.</p>

<p>Our world population has grown more in the past 50 years than in the previous four million. With rapid population growth, one-third to one-half of earth's land surface has been transformed and 80 percent of the original forests have been cleared, fragmented or otherwise degraded.  A sixfold increase in global fresh water consumption occurred between 1900 and 1995 alone, with studies estimating that by 2025, two out of every three people on earth will live in water-stressed conditions.</p>

<p>On global and national levels, population growth rates and human pressures are changing the environment at an unprecedented rate.  Approximately 25 percent of the world's mammals and 11 percent of its birds are currently at significant risk of extinction.  Some estimate that two-thirds of all species may disappear by the end of this century.</p>

<p>An example of the devastation population growth can have on wildlife is the Florida panther. Historically, the panther ranged throughout the southeast United States.  Today, due primarily to booming southeast population and the resulting urban and agricultural development, the only known self-sustaining panther population – a mere 50 animals – currently exists in southwest Florida.</p>

<P>But these problems are solvable.  For example, studies show that fertility rates (the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime) drop most rapidly where there are improved child survival rates, higher education levels, and workable voluntary family planning policies.</p>

<P><i>The nation's largest member-supported conservation education and 

advocacy group, the National Wildlife Federation unites people from 

all walks of life to protect nature, wildlife and the world we all 

share.  The Federation has educated and inspired families to uphold America's conservation tradition since 1936.</i></p>
