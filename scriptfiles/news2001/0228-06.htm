- February 28 - A massive and unprecedented coalition of coalitions -- with total

membership of more than 500 national organizations -- will hold a

news conference on Thursday, March 1 to announce plans to work for

the defeat of the unfair and irresponsible Bush tax cut proposal.

<p>The coalitions joining forces in this nationwide effort include

the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the AFL-CIO, the Invest

in America Coalition, the Coalition on Human Needs, and the

National Low-Income Housing Coalition. They represent a wide

diversity of organizations including civil rights, labor, women's,

environmental, disability, religious, gay and lesbian, health care

reform, campaign finance reform, good government, older Americans'

and children's groups, and more.

<p>The new nationwide coalition has collected scores of

organizational endorsements just since its first organizational

meeting last Friday. Even as more organizations sign on, work is

already underway to develop a nationwide, three-prong campaign of

organizing, lobbying, and public information to educate and

mobilize the public against the high risks the Bush proposal poses

for millions of Americans and for our economic health, as well.
