- June 13 - Bono, lead singer of U2 

and tireless campaigner for the cancellation of third world debt is 

today taking a day off U2's highly successful Elevation Tour to 

visit members of Congress and the administration. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the afternoon Bono will meet with Paul O'Neill, and Sen. 

Jesse Helms will arrange a lunch to which both Democrats and 

Republicans will be invited. Earlier in the day Bono will meet Sen. 

Bill Frist to discuss the links between the debt and AIDS crises. 

Others he will meet during the day include Secretary Tommy 

Thompson, Chairman Oxley, Chairman Kolbe, Sen. Pat Leahy, Sen. 

Orrin Hatch and World Bank President Jim Wolfensohn, amongst 

others. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle will be at the U2 

concert on the evening of Thursday, June 14. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light of the exponential spread of AIDS especially in 

sub-Saharan Africa Bono will be urging Washington's political 

leaders to consider what more they must do to rise to the challenge 

presented by this tragic pandemic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the day Bono will discuss how a serious effort to 

tackle the AIDS crisis must build upon current debt relief measures 

through a more comprehensive policy package which includes: deeper 

debt relief, a greater quantity and quality of funding for health 

care and education in poor countries and access to cheapest 

essential medicines. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notes to Editors: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- So far 23 countries have qualified for some debt relief under 

the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. These 

countries have seen their annual debt payments reduced by 27 

percent, freeing up approximately $750 million per year to help 

fight poverty in these countries </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- However, even after HIPC the majority of these countries 

still spend more repaying debts than on healthcare. This is one of 

the reasons why a solution to the AIDS crisis must include more 

debt relief. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The IMF and WB are now by far the biggest creditors to the 

qualifying HIPC countries. Rich creditor nations led by the U.S., 

have agreed to cancel 100 percent of the debts they are owed by the 

poorest nations. However, the International Monetary Fund and the 

World Bank are canceling less than half the debts they are owed. As 

a result the poorest countries still spend more on repaying debts 

than healthcare. The IMF and WB should now be directed by their 

shareholders (including the USA) to cancel the debts they are owed 

by qualifying HIPCs </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- An independent review conducted by London based accountancy 

firm Chantrey Vellacott, has shown that the IMF and World Bank can 

afford 100 percent cancellation for qualifying HIPCs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Bono has visited Washington ten times over the last three 

years to lobby as part of the global Jubilee &quot;Drop the Debt&quot; 

campaign to cancel the unpayable debts of the world's poorest 

countries. He has met with Pope John Paul II, Secretary of State 

Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice, former President Clinton, Tony Blair 

of the UK, Jacques Chirac of France, Gerhard Schroder of Germany, 

IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler and World Bank President James 

Wolfensohn, among others. </font></p>
