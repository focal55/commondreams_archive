- March 5 -  A yearlong investigation

by the Center for Public Integrity shows that British American

Tobacco, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds have worked closely with

companies and individuals directly connected to organized crime in

the global smuggling of cigarettes.

<p>The investigation by the Center's International Consortium of

Investigative Journalists is based on a review of thousands of

pages of corporate and government documents and dozens of

interviews with law enforcement officials, smugglers and other

sources worldwide. It indicates that tobacco smuggling is

increasingly dominated by a handful of criminal organizations that

in some cases have links to organized crime.

<p>Corporate documents, court records and internal government

reports -- some dating to the 1970s -- also show that BAT, Philip

Morris and RJR have orchestrated smuggling networks variously in

Canada, Colombia, China, Southeast Asia, Europe, the Middle East,

Africa and the United States as a major part of their marketing

strategy to increase profits.

<p>It's estimated that about one in every three cigarettes exported

worldwide is sold on the black market.

<p>The companies have sought to undercut rising government taxes,

which studies show are the main reason most smokers quit, as well

as to gain market share by offering competitively priced popular

international brands on the black market.

<p>The result has been tax evasion on a global scale that has

greatly depleted government treasuries, especially in Third World

countries. Cigarette smuggling has also fostered international

crime and money laundering and alarmed growing numbers of law

enforcement officials worldwide.

<p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists first

revealed the link between tobacco companies and cigarette smuggling

in a January 2000 report based on 11,000 pages of corporate

documents, dealing mostly with Latin America and Asia.

<p>Those findings were published in over 40 media outlets in 10

countries and helped prompt a parliamentary hearing in Britain, as

well as a formal government investigation. Since then, three civil

lawsuits have been filed in the United States against the tobacco

companies under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations

(RICO) act -- the latest by the European Union and several of its

member nations.
