- April 16 -  Across the country, more

people are taking public transportation to their destinations. In

2000, public transportation ridership went up by 3.5 percent,

compared to the previous year, according to statistics released

today by the American Public Transportation Association. A total

of 9.4 billion rides were taken on the nation's trains and

buses last year, the highest number of trips in more than 40 years.

<p>Last year, public transportation grew four times faster than the

U.S. population (0.9 percent), faster than domestic air travel

(2.6 percent) and car use, which was flat. In the past five years,

the number of trips taken on public transportation grew by

21 percent, growing faster than the U.S. population (4.8 percent),

highway use (11 percent), and domestic air travel (19

percent).

<p>"Americans are taking public transportation because they know it

is a smart choice, " said William W. Millar, APTA

President. "Easy-to-use quality public transportation provides

access, freedom and mobility to help people do what is

important to them."

<p>Modes of transportation showing the largest percentage increases

in ridership for 2000 were heavy rail (subways), 7.6

percent; demand response or paratransit, 5.9 percent; light rail,

5.3 percent; and commuter rail, 5.2 percent. Ridership

increases were seen from coast to coast, in large cities, suburban

communities and in small towns. Examples of ridership

gain include -- San Francisco's BART heavy rail system (7.6

percent), San Jose, California's light rail system (34 percent)

and Denver's light rail system (40.6 percent). Among small and

large bus systems, Washington D.C.'s Metrobus system (8.4

percent); Lansing, Michigan (19.3 percent); and Bloomington,

Indiana (34 percent) served more riders in 2000.

<p>The continued growth in public transportation ridership is

attributed to the economy, expansion of service with new lines

and extensions, higher levels of investment by federal, state and

local sources and enhanced customer services by the

nation's transit systems that meet the needs of today's traveling

public.

<p><i>APTA is a nonprofit international association of over 1,300

member organizations including transit systems; planning,

design, construction and finance firms; product and service

providers; academic institutions, and state associations and

departments of transportation. APTA members serve the public

interest by providing safe, efficient and economical transit

services and products. APTA members serve over ninety percent of

people using public transportation in North America.
