- February 5 - The “mandatory” environmental standards announced by the International Council

of Cruise Lines (ICCL) today are little more than a savvy public relations

maneuver by the cruise industry, according to the environmental group

Bluewater

Network. 



<p>“Today’s announcement, while a heartening sign of increased environmental

awareness by the cruise ship industry, is a tactical gesture that must be

understood in context  they are squirming because they are under the

regulatory

microscope right now, and are trying to stave off the heightened oversight and

stricter regulation of cruise ship pollution that will hopefully ensue,” says

Kira Schmidt, director of Bluewater Network’s Cruise Ship Campaign. “The

standards, which are weaker than those which are likely to be required under

new regulations, lack teeth because they are completely unenforceable, and the

punishment for violation -- being kicked out of the ICCL -- is a meager

deterrent at best.”



<p>Bluewater led a coalition of 55 environmental groups in a March 2000 petition

urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to address gaps and loopholes

in environmental laws which have essentially given cruise ships a license to

pollute. In response, the EPA established a formal process to examine the

cruise ship pollution problem, and after three public hearings and lengthy

inter-agency consultation, is poised to release its Assessment Report later

this month, which is likely to recommend certain regulatory measures. In

addition, Congress passed legislation in December which restricts the

discharge

of sewage and waste water from cruise ships in Alaska waters and requires the

Coast Guard and EPA to establish monitoring, sampling and effluent standards.

The California legislature also passed a state law, sponsored by Bluewater

Network, to more closely monitor cruise ship pollution. A similar bill is

currently before the Alaska legislature.  The cruise ship industry has lobbied

fiercely against all of these efforts at increased regulation. 



<p>“It is commendable that the ICCL cruise lines are finally addressing their

environmental impacts by seeking to improve environmental performance through

voluntary guidelines, but it is not enough.  Self-regulation by industry,

particularly by one such as the cruise industry, which has a history of

egregious environmental violations, will not provide the necessary protection

for our environment,” says Schmidt. “Voluntary industry standards must be

complemented by strong environmental regulations with stringent oversight and

enforcement mechanisms. The cruise industry has evaded regulatory and public

scrutiny for too long, but those days are over, and no announcement of

self-regulation will turn this tide. With the current development of stricter

laws to control cruise ship pollution, the oceans will finally receive the

protection they deserve.”



<p>Ms. Schmidt also points out that ICCL represents less than two-thirds of the

cruise ships operating in North America, so many cruise ships will not be

following the standards.
