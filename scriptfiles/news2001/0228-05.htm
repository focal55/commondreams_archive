- February 28 - Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) applauds the Supreme Court decision upholding the country's air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter.   (Whitman v. American Trucking Assn. and American Trucking Assn. v. Whitman)

<p>"One of the primary purposes of environmental laws and regulations is to protect human health.  The Clean Air Act embodies this idea and recognizes that protecting public health is of the utmost importance. This decision supports this piece of landmark legislation and the goals Congress intended to achieve when it passed the law," said Karen Hopfl-Harris, environmental attorney and Associate Director of Policy at PSR.</p>



<p>Congress intended the EPA to only consider the latest and best available science when setting new national ambient air quality standards. The cost to human health in terms of illness and death, rather than the cost to industry, is the only cost that should be considered in setting these standards. According to the EPA, the new standards will protect 125 million Americans, including 35 million children, from the health hazards of air pollution. 15,000 premature deaths and 350,000 cases of aggravated asthma will be avoided each year. </p>



<p>"You can't put a high enough value on numbers like these. Parents of children with asthma and respiratory disease can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the government is doing all it can to help their children breathe easier," said Susan West, MPH, Director of Environmental Health Education and Outreach at PSR. "The Supreme Court recognized the authority of the EPA to protect the health of Americans."</p>



<p>PSR filed an Amicus Curiae, or friend-of-the-court brief, which supported the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) position that the financial costs of implementing health protective standards cannot be considered when setting air-quality standards themselves under the Clean Air Act.</p>



<p>"This decision sends a strong signal to industry and the Bush Administration that the Supreme Court is not going to severely limit an agency's ability to implement the laws that protect public health," said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., CEO and Executive Director of Physicians for Social Responsibility. "The Supreme Court recognized not only EPA's authority, but also its duty, to ensure that all individuals in our nation can breathe healthy air.  The decision also ensured once more that the will and intent of Congress to provide Americans with health-based standards for hazardous air pollutants cannot be foiled by an industry driven to consider profits over public health" </p>



<P>PSR represents 20,000 doctors and public health professionals nationwide.
