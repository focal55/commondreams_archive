- November 11 - On the tenth anniversary of the Santa Cruz Massacre in East Timor, the East 

Timor Action Network (ETAN) called for justice for its victims and the many 

others harmed by since Indonesia's invasion and occupation of the territory 

in 1975. The 1991 massacre -- witnessed and filmed by journalists --is 

considered a turning point in East Timor's struggle for independence.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Grassroots activists in 20 U.S. cities will pay tribute to those killed 

with various actions throughout the week of November 12 to increase local 

and national awareness of the need for justice for East Timor and to urge a 

U.S. policy which supports an international tribunal for crimes against 

humanity and war crimes committed in East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;East Timor will soon be independent, but its people have yet to see 

justice for 24 years of systematic rights abuses by the Indonesian 

military,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>

<p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are urging the Bush administration to actively work for an 

international tribunal for East Timor. Such a policy would demonstrate a 

commitment to justice during the tenth anniversary of this notorious 

massacre and begin to redress the years of active U.S. support for 

Indonesia's occupation of East Timor,&quot; added Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On November 12, 1991, Indonesian troops opened fire on a memorial 

procession to the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili, East Timor's capital, that 

had turned into a peaceful pro-independence demonstration. More than 270 

East Timorese were murdered. This massacre, unlike many others committed 

during Indonesia's 24-year occupation, was filmed and photographed by 

international journalists.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Santa Cruz Massacre galvanized international support for East Timor and 

was the catalyst for congressional action to stem the flow of U.S. weapons 

and other assistance for Indonesia's security forces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Almost two years ago, the UN Security Council called on Indonesia to bring 

the perpetrators of its 1999 scorched-earth campaign to justice 'as soon as 

possible' and 'institute a swift, comprehensive, effective, and transparent 

legal process, in conformity with international standards of justice and 

due process of law.'  How much longer will this waiting game go on?&quot; 

questioned Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. and other members of  the Security Council can no longer pretend 

that Indonesia will bring senior or even mid-level military and civilian 

personnel responsible for crimes against humanity in East Timor to justice. 

Although the UN and Indonesia's own human rights commission have documented 

a wealth of evidence strongly implicating the highest levels of Indonesia's 

security forces, not one indictment, let alone a prosecution, has yet been 

filed against them, &quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri recently amended the decree 

establishing the still-delayed Indonesian ad hoc human rights court on East 

Timor. The court's scope remains limited to the months of April and 

September,1999, and to three of East Timor's 13 districts, with no 

attention given to the many cases of violence against women. The court's 

limited jurisdiction will effectively exclude the high-level planning of 

1999's scorched-earth campaign and the massive displacement of the 

population. Megawati's newly appointed Attorney General M.A. Rahman has 

recommended prosecuting only low-ranking officers, ignoring those with the 

greatest responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ETAN activists across the U.S. will hold candlelight vigils, meet with 

congressional offices, and do local outreach to mark the Santa Cruz 

Massacre anniversary. A November 12 forum on &quot;Justice for East Timor: 10 

Years After the Santa Cruz Massacre&quot; in New York City (7:30 p.m., 147 W. 70 

St. nr. Columbus) will feature Constancio Pinto, East Timor's 

representative to the U.S.; journalist Amy Goodman, an eyewitness to the 

Santa Cruz Massacre; and Michael Ratner, attorney with Center for 

Constitutional Rights, part of the legal team which has won substantial 

judgments in U.S. courts against Indonesian generals for crimes against 

humanity in East Timor, including the massacre.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Congress Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) and Representatives Lane Evans 

(D-IL) and Frank Wolf (R-VA) are taking the lead to commemorate the Santa 

Cruz Massacre by circulating a letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell 

urging the Bush administration to actively and publicly work for the 

establishment of an international tribunal on East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A UN International Commission of Inquiry on East Timor in January 2000 

called for establishing an international tribunal. East Timor will become 

independent in May 2002 after two and one-half years of direct UN 

administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) advocates democracy, sustainable 

development, social, legal, and economic justice and human rights, 

including women's rights, for the people of East Timor. ETAN, which has 28 

local chapters throughout the U.S., calls for an international tribunal to 

prosecute crimes against humanity that took place in East Timor since 1975.</i></font></p>
