- April 11 - <i>&quot;There are hundreds and hundreds of organizations across the country that

now believe Citigroup will do everything for a buck.&quot;</i><br>

                Martin Eakes, Self-Help Credit Union, in The New York Times</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citigroup's latest ad campaign enjoins customers to &quot;live richly,&quot; but some

shareholders question &quot;who's living richly off of whom?&quot; At Citigroup's

annual meeting on Tuesday, April 17, 2001, at Carnegie Hall in New York

City, Martin Eakes, founder of Self-Help Credit Union, will present a

Responsible Wealth resolution linking CEO pay to accountability on issues

such as predatory lending, racial discrimination, and environmental abuses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, while Citigroup's Sandy Weill was the second highest paid CEO in

the U.S., Citigroup was charged by the EEOC with racial discrimination at

the company's Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary.  Citigroup was also

criticized for weak environmental lending standards and its role in such

controversial projects as China's Three Gorges Dam.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Associates First Capital, owned by Citigroup and one of the nation's largest

consumer lenders, was charged last month by federal regulators with

routinely deceiving and lying to customers and tricking them into costly

loan refinancings. Associates'practices primarily victimized poor

borrowers, Federal Trade Commission officials told the New York Times.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed resolution provides a mechanism to evaluate the company's

officers on meeting social responsibility objectives and gives company

leaders a positive incentive to ensure that Citigroup meet its

responsibilities to employees, customers, the community and the environment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In a year when the company faced a race discrimination suit, a consumer

boycott by environmentalists and a pending suit by the Federal Trade

Commission, Mr. Weill&sup1;s bonus and restricted stock payments both doubled.

Citigroup hasn&sup1;t disclosed whether these ethical lapses played a role in

setting his pay,&quot; said Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHOTO OPPORTUNITY:  Citigroup will also be challenged outside the meeting byactivists carrying the company&sup1;s signature red umbrellas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Responsible Wealth has filed shareholder resolutions related to executive

compensation at seven companies: Disney, FleetBoston, Raytheon, Household

International, Exxon Mobil and AT&amp;T, as well as Citigroup.  Supporting the

resolutions is a recent study by Scott Klinger which concludes that

skyrocketing CEO pay foreshadows poor stock performance. The report and the

texts of the shareholder resolutions can be found at: <a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org">www.responsiblewealth.org</a>.</i></font></p>
