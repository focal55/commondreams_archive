<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- October 9 - As Washington attempts to find some level of normalcy in the

midst of war, House Democrats tomorrow are scheduled to take up

an election not unlike that of a high school contest for class

president. At stake is the Democrats' No. 2 in command, the

position of House minority whip, an office named for its

responsibility of whipping up support among the rank-and-file

for the party's legislative positions.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.), who has been the Democrats' whip

for more than a decade, is set to resign the position in January

in order to concentrate on his bid to become Michigan's next

governor. Though Bonior only announced his intentions last

month, his would-be successors--Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)

and Steny Hoyer (D-Md.)--began butting heads almost three years

ago in their quest to join the party leadership. In the process,

they also became major campaign contributors.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's a contest based almost entirely on personal relationships.

Back in 1999, Hoyer and Pelosi each launched a lobbying campaign

not unlike those pursued by major industries, aimed solely at

wooing fellow Democrats. At the time, both hoped to fill an

additional leadership position that would have been created only

if Democrats had recaptured control of the House during the 2000

elections.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their efforts to curry favor with Democratic colleagues,

Pelosi and Hoyer criss-crossed the country raising money for

other Democrats. Perhaps more significantly, the two made

numerous contributions from their own campaign coffers to

colleagues in need. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 1999-2000 election cycle, Pelosi was the third

biggest congressional contributor to federal parties and

candidates, giving more than $1.1 million to Democrats via her

personal campaign account and her leadership committee, PAC to

the Future. She was surpassed in giving only by Speaker of the

House Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Majority Whip Tom DeLay

(R-Texas), who each contributed roughly $1.3 million. Hoyer

ranked No. 5 on the list, contributing roughly $927,000 to the

Democratic party and other candidates.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the opening months of the 2002 election cycle, the checks are

still flowing. During the first six months of this year, Hoyer

contributed $190,700 to Democratic party committees and

candidates on the federal level, while Pelosi contributed

roughly $180,000. The list of recipients on both sides includes

lots of freshman Democrats, many of whom got money from both

Pelosi and Hoyer during their 2000 campaigns.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As of Monday, Pelosi was reporting that she had 120 commitments

of support from fellow Democrats, while Hoyer claimed 105

supporters. However, both cannot be right, since only 215 people

will be eligible to vote (the 210 Democratic members and five

non-voting delegates of the House--including District of

Columbia delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton. If all voters

participate, the winner will need 108 votes to secure a victory.
