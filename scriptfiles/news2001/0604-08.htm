- June 4 -  President Bush's visit to

the Everglades today "appears to be a public-relations stunt aimed

at whitewashing his extreme anti-environmental agenda," Defenders

of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen said.

<p>"Floridians aren't fooled by the president's photo opportunity,"

Schlickeisen said. "All he is saying, apparently, is that he won't

fight against laws passed last year to protect the Florida

Everglades. It's strange that he seems to want credit for that as

a positive initiative for the environment. In fact, we've yet to

see real environmental progress with this administration, though

we've seen a lot of the opposite. If President Bush's

anti-environmental proposals are enacted, we could see oil rigs in

the Gulf of Mexico polluting the state's beautiful beaches,

imperilled Florida species disappearing entirely, and the timber

industry exploiting the state's few remaining Wildernesses for

profit."

<p>Among the ways the Bush agenda would harm Florida:

<p>-- By attempting to gut the Endangered Species Act, the Bush

administration threatens the existence of several native Florida

plants and many other species whose populations are at risk and

whose habitats are disappearing. The White House has asked Congress

to effectively deny citizens the right to petition their government

to protect species under the landmark act. Interior Secretary Gale

Norton, who once contended that the Endangered Species Act was

unconstitutional, would gain the sole authority to decide which

species should be protected.

<p>"Florida has more listed endangered and threatened species than

almost any other state. A commitment by this administration to

fulfilling the promise of the Endangered Species Act is essential

for Florida. The steps this administration has taken so far to

undercut citizen involvement and cripple this law leave little hope

that they would work to save imperilled Florida species," said

Laurie Macdonald, director of Defenders of Wildlife's programs in

Florida.

<p>Through its equivocal statements on new federal rules banning

logging, mining and road-building in 58 million acres of national

forests, the Bush administration has opened the door to commercial

exploitation of some of Florida's natural treasures. Nearly 45,000

acres of scenic wilderness in the Apalachicola, Osceola and Ocala

National Forests would have been off-limits to exploitation under

the federal roadless rule, which the timber industry and other foes

recently succeeded in blocking in court. Instead of vigorously

defending the government's case, the Bush administration has

offered little resistance to that lawsuit and is preparing to

severely weaken the rule even if it eventually survives the court

challenge.

<p>The Bush administration reportedly favors drilling for oil off

the coast of Florida. That's even though, as a presidential

candidate, Bush opposed drilling and, as president, he promised to

defer to governors of Gulf Coast states. His brother, Gov. Jeb

Bush, is adamantly opposed to drilling because he says it would

pollute the state's coast and hurt the tourist industry.

<p>Schlickeisen also pointed out that even as President Bush

visited the Everglades and declared his support for national parks,

the Administration reportedly was preparing to scuttle a National

Park Service plan to protect the nearby Big Cypress National

Preserve from environmentally-devastating off-road vehicles.

<p>Home to many endangered and threatened species, Big Cypress

borders Everglades National Park and is part of the national park

system itself. Off-road vehicles now are given virtually

unrestricted access to Big Cypress, and they've plowed enough miles

of destructive trails inside the preserve to encircle the planet.

<p>"If President Bush is genuinely concerned about our national

parks, he will support the U.S. Department of the Interior's

reasonable plan to manage off-road vehicle use in Big Cypress,"

Schlickeisen said. "It's only common sense to restrict off-road

vehicles to designated trails so that we can save this beautiful

preserve for the enjoyment of future generations."

<p><i>Defenders of Wildlife is a leading nonprofit conservation

organization recognized as one of the nation's most progressive

advocates for wildlife and its habitat. With more than 430,000

members and supporters, Defenders of Wildlife is an effective

leader on endangered species issues.
