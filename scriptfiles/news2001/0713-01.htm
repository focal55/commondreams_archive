- July 13 -  Michael D. Barnes,

president of the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun

Violence, issued the following statement today regarding the Bush

Administration's position on the United Nations Conference

on the Illicit Trade of Small Arms and Light Weapons:

<p>"The Bush Administration should be ashamed of its blatant

pandering to the National Rifle Association. It was quite evident

by Under Secretary John Bolton's plenary address to the U.N.

Conference that the White House is kowtowing to the NRA yet again,

by sounding false alarms about the conference as a threat to legal

gun ownership. If there was ever any doubt that the NRA is working

out of the White House -- as an NRA official promised if Bush were

President -- there certainly shouldn't be any now.

<p>"The goal of this conference is to address the illegal trade of

firearms -- trade that supplies crime syndicates, drug traffickers,

and warlords engaged in conflicts and terrorizing citizens around

the world. Conference documents explicitly state that no proposals

will affect legal gun ownership, nor will they affect a nation's

own gun laws. Yet the Bush State Department has decided to play

the obstructionist by throwing up the spectre of international

agreements made at the conference as a threat to private gun

ownership in the United States.

<p>"Tellingly, Congressman Bob Barr, an NRA Board member and one

of the gun lobby's most faithful yes-men in Congress, was invited

by the State Department to serve as a member of the U.S. delegation

to this conference, even as Mr. Bolton denies any NRA involvement

in the government's position. In the June 2001 issue of its

publication, America's First Freedom, the NRA sounds warning bells

about the U.N. Conference as 'A Worldwide Threat to Gun Owners,'

claiming that 'Gun owners (also) have reason to be concerned about

the United Nations' long-term effort to turn private gun ownership

into the moral equivalent of child pornography.'

<p>"Such extremist rhetoric is to be expected of the NRA, an

organization whose leadership demonizes federal law enforcement

officers as 'jack-booted thugs' and considers governments as

'hostile to permitting citizens to own the means to resist

political power.' The NRA has shown a callous disregard for the

devastation caused by firearms here in the U.S. -- why should we

expect it to care about deaths elsewhere? It is appalling however,

that our own government should buy into the NRA's paranoid

delusions. Once again, Mr. Bush needs to be reminded that the

office he holds is supposed to serve the people of the United

States, not the narrow, alarmist views of the NRA."

<p><i>As the largest national, non-partisan, grassroots organization

leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign and

the Brady Center are dedicated to creating an America free from gun

violence, where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work,

and in their communities. The Brady Campaign and the Brady Center

believe that a safer America can be achieved without banning all

guns.

</i>

<p><i>The Brady Campaign works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws,

regulations and public policies through grassroots activism,

electing pro-gun-control public officials and increasing public

awareness of gun violence.

</i>

<p><i>The Brady Center works to reform the gun industry and educate

the public about gun violence through litigation and grassroots

mobilization, and works to enact and enforce sensible regulations

to reduce gun violence including regulations governing the gun

industry.
