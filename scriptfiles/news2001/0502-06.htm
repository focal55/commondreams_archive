- May 2 - Calling attention to the many problems exhibited in the Bush

Administration&#146;s approach to energy issues, a group of eight energy advocacy

organizations released a statement Wednesday expressing their disappointment with

Cheney&#146;s recent speech that previewed the proposals being considered by the

Administration&#146;s energy team.

<p>The statement points out that the energy crisis has been manufactured by many of the

same corporations, which could stand to reap enormous financial windfalls from

implementation of the Administration&#146;s proposals. The groups, already let down by

many of Bush&#146;s environmental policies, question the motivations and influences of the

White House energy team. </p>



<p>Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment

Program charged, &quot;The only shade of green that the Bush/Cheney team love is the color

of money. Their energy plan is reckless and it will not bring down the cost of energy.

Their energy plan represents a giant payback to the energy industry which helped elect

Bush, and their increased profits are coming straight out of American paychecks.&quot;</p>



<p>Harvey Wasserman, senior advisor to Greenpeace USA, and author of <u>The Last Energy

War</u>, asked, &quot;Mr. Cheney, why are you hiding from the sun? Why are you hiding from

wind power, which is so much cheaper and faster to build than nuclear power? Why are you

hiding from efficiency and conservation? We realize the fossil/nuclear corporations that

put you in office don't profit from these clean sources of energy, but is that a reason to

deny them to the public?&quot;</p>



<p>The groups insist that the United States should be moving along more innovative paths

by focusing on conservation and efficiency of existing resources, and promoting research

and utilization of renewable, sustainable energy sources. The energy plan under

development thus far appears to focus primarily on old technologies such as oil, gas, and

coal, and even a revival of the nuclear industry. According to the groups, these energy

sources are dirty, wasteful, and dangerous, and do not show nearly the promise for

efficient, long-term economic viability that renewables do. </p>



<p>Addressing the short-sighted and backwards approach of the Administration on energy and

environmental issues, Alice Slater, President of Global Resource Action Center for the

Environment (GRACE), said &quot;Not only did most Americans say &#145;No!&#146; to nuclear

power over twenty years ago, they called out for more development of safe, sustainable,

and renewable energy. This is not it. Nuclear power was one of the root causes of the

breakdown in California, and now, astonishingly, it is being proposed as a solution.

Clearly, we are long overdue for a far-sighted energy plan.&quot;</p>



<p>Anna Aurilio, Legislative Director for U.S. PIRG, said, &quot;We're astonished that

President Bush and Vice President Cheney are ignoring energy efficiency - the fastest,

cleanest cheapest way to deal with energy problems. Instead they're crafting an energy

plan that will do nothing for consumers and reward the oil, coal and nuclear companies who

will continue to profit at our expense.&quot;
