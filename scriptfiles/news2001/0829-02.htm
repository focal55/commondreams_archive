<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- August 29 -  A new Urban Institute report on workers without health insurance suggests that the most efficient way to increase coverage is to target subsidies toward low-income workers. The report offers the most detailed picture yet of the uninsured working population—now numbering more than 16 million—and compares the relative merits of two key vehicles for expanding coverage: tax credits or public programs. It also contains some surprises: though Hispanics are less likely to be covered overall, they accept employer offers of health insurance at the same rate as whites and African Americans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;<a href="http://www.urban.org/pdfs/workershealthins.pdf" target="_new">Workers Without Health Insurance: Who Are They and How Can Policy Reach Them?</a>&quot; by Urban Institute researchers Bowen Garrett, Len Nichols and Emily Greenman, characterizes today’s uninsured and examines the policy implications. The report, based on analyses of 1999 Current Population Survey data and a survey of the literature on the working uninsured, was developed for the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as part of its <i>Community Voices: HealthCare for the Underserved</i> initiative series.  Accompanying the release is the first national Workers’ Health Insurance Index.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firms offer health insurance if their workers demand it, but the evidence makes clear that many low-income workers cannot afford to demand health insurance today,&quot; concludes Nichols, a health policy expert. &quot;Increasing their purchasing power through targeted subsidies is the surest way to expand coverage. If such subsidies are structured properly, the share of firms that offer health insurance and the share of workers who enroll would both increase.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who Are the Working Uninsured?</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the workers more likely to lack health insurance: workers in small firms; retail workers; construction workers; service workers; low-wage workers; part-time workers; short-tenure workers; and workers who live in low-income households. Over half (59 percent) of uninsured workers’ employers do not sponsor health insurance; 21 percent are not eligible for their employer’s plan; and 20 percent decline the coverage they are offered at work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Low-income workers are much less likely than higher-income workers to be offered, be eligible for, or enroll in employer-sponsored insurance.  Hispanic workers have the lowest rate of coverage, primarily due to their employers not offering coverage.  African-American and white workers are equally likely to have offers, but whites have more access to coverage through a spouse.  If a firm offered health insurance, take-up rates did not vary by race or ethnicity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We need to eradicate and eliminate barriers to health insurance for all individuals, regardless of race,&quot; says Dr. Henrie Treadwell, Program Director at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.  &quot;This report shows the importance of offering workers health insurance as a first step in increasing access.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Firm Size Matters More than Industry Type.</b></i> Workers in larger firms are more likely to be offered, be eligible for, and to enroll in employer-sponsored health insurance, regardless of industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Sponsorship Rates Track with Take-Up Rates.</b></i> Across industries, rates of employer sponsorship of insurance vary more than take-up rates, but the rates are correlated. The findings suggest that workers’ ability and willingness to pay for health insurance coverage are key to a firm’s decision to sponsor a health insurance program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Policy Implications</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Target Low-Income Workers.</b></i> Policies designed to expand health insurance coverage tend to focus on workers in low-income households, low-wage workers, and small firms. Many low-wage workers, the authors point out, are secondary earners in higher-income households and are already insured. &quot;Targeting subsidy dollars to low-<i>income</i> workers would extend eligibility to a large share of uninsured workers, and would be less likely than targeting low-<i>wage</i> workers to subsidize workers who already have coverage,&quot; says health economist Garrett. Targeting workers in small firms is the least likely to reach a high share of uninsured workers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Tax Credits Should Be Refundable, Applicable to Employer Plans.</b></i> The authors suggest that employer tax credits are easier to administer than individual tax credits, but are not as likely to expand health insurance coverage.  At the same time, individual tax credits would need to be refundable to help low-income workers. If the individual tax credit approach is adopted, subsidies would be more effective if they were applicable to either employer-sponsored or non-group insurance.  Overall, health insurance subsidy dollars will go farther if current or new institutions are used to take advantage of administrative, risk pooling, and purchasing economies of scale.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Public Programs Could Help Low-Income Workers.</b></i> Public program expansions would work better than individual tax credits to reduce the rate of worker uninsurance for low-income workers, unless a tax credit subsidy is nearly equal to the price of an insurance policy.  But public program expansions would require a more elaborate eligibility-determination system, either through the tax system or a state welfare agency.</font></p>
