- May 22 - The Southern Company spent more than $48 million in 1999 on public relations efforts and political activities, in large part to avoid having to clean up its old, dirty power plants, according to a new report released today by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Clean Up Southern Company campaign. The report, Abuse of Power: Southern Company's Campaign to Undo, Weaken, Delay and Circumvent Life Saving Pollution Rules, finds that Southern Company spent more money lobbying Congress than any other utility company, and was the second highest donor to federal political candidates among all energy companies, including Exxon-Mobil and BP Amoco.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also shows that while Southern Company&#146;s public relations campaign strives to portray an image of environmental responsibility, its policy agenda seeks to weaken, delay or repeal important public health protections from health standards for smog and soot, to mercury reduction rules, to standards requiring the company to modernize their older plants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Southern Company has invested millions in building a green image for the public through advertising, bill inserts and other slick materials,&quot; said report co-author Jim Haefele, Clean Air Advocate for U.S. PIRG. &quot;It's an outrage that the company consistently uses its enormous political clout to fight against pollution standards that would require clean up of its dirty plants,&quot; he continued. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Southern Company, based in Atlanta, Georgia, operates some of the largest sources of air pollution in the nation. According to the EPA, in 1999 Southern Company emitted more of the pollution that causes smog and soot formation, acid rain, global warming and mercury contamination than any other power company. Southern Company&#146;s annual emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution is the equivalent of the emissions from 17 million cars.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April, more than a hundred local, state and national organizations launched the grassroots Clean Up Southern Company campaign.  The campaign challenges the new Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, Allen Franklin, to commit Southern Company to a new course of action toward cleaner power production that will allow the company to live up to its promise to be &quot;a leader in protecting the environment.&quot; 14,000 people have participated in the campaign by signing a postcard or sending a fax to Mr. Franklin already.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key findings of Abuse of Power include:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Building a Green Image:  Southern Company reports spending $23.9 million in 1999 on advertising and other communications, much of which says or implies that the company is working to protect the environment.  For example:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Southern Company's 1999 annual report commits to environmental excellence 23 times in a 26-page introduction, and shows 15 images of wildlife, forests and oceans out of a total of 30 photographs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Georgia Power&#146;s bill inserts regularly include the a message stating its commitment to a clean environment;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The company's Web site is replete with sweeping environmental commitments that are in direct conflict with the company'&#146;s pollution history and political activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B. Building Political Influence:  Southern Company reports spending $24 million in 1999 on &quot;Political and Related Activities.&quot; While it's not possible to document what all of this money bought, federal reporting requirements reveal that:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Southern Company spent $4.2 million on lobbying at the federal level alone, far and away more than any other utility company.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Southern Company employed 14 in-house lobbyists, and 11 outside lobby firms, including Republican insider Haley Barbour, as well as Democratic insider Kathleen McGinty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Southern Company contributed more than $1.4 million to political candidates and parties in the 1999-2000 election cycle, outspending every other energy company except Enron.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Three-quarters of Southern Company's contributions were given to Republicans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Southern Company targeted lawmakers with influence over energy and environmental policy, including members of the Senate Energy Committee, the Senate committee that decides the funding priorities for the Environmental Protection Agency, and the House Commerce Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C. Using Its Political Access to Undo, Weaken, Delay and Circumvent Important Pollution Rules:  Southern Company and its allies and trade associations have consistently opposed regulatory attempts to address air pollution from the electric industry, including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A program to restore clear vistas to our national parks and wilderness areas;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Enforcement of the Clean Air Act provision that requires old power plants to be retrofit with modern pollution controls;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Creation of domestic and international programs to curb global warming;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Adoption of new health standards for soot and smog;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A program to address the transport of smog across state borders in the Eastern United States;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Adoption of limits to the amount of mercury that can be emitted by coal plants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report demonstrates that Southern Company does more than just pollute the air,&quot; said Haefele. &quot;It is also fighting to ensure that its pollution continues unabated by creating a misleading public image as well as influencing the political process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report can be found at the Campaign's Web site, <a href="http://www.cleanupsoutherncompany.com">www.cleanupsoutherncompany.com</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Clean Up Southern Company is a campaign led by the state PIRGs and supported by over 100 local, state and national organizations from the public health, environmental, outdoor, minority and other public interest advocacy communities.</i></font></p>
