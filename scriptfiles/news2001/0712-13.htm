- July 12 - Senate lawmakers today took a commendable and critical step toward ensuring the safety

of American motorists by requiring inspections and audits of Mexican truck companies

before they are certified to enter the United States.

<p>Praise is due to Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Richard Shelby (D-Ala.) and other

members of the Senate Appropriations Committee who confronted this difficult issue and

passed an effective mandate to DOT to address the potential threats of unsafe Mexican

trucks. These are essential because Mexico &#151; unlike the United States and Canada

&#151; does not have mandatory safety standards in effect for large trucks.</p>



<p>The committee&#146;s measure: 1) requires a full safety audit of Mexican trucking firms

before granting them a conditional operating certificate and a follow-up safety audit

within 18 months before a permanent operating certificate is granted; 2) prohibits opening

the border to Mexican trucks until a policy is in place to ensure that Mexican truckers

comply with United States hours-of-service rules; 3) provides funding for 80 additional

border inspectors; prohibits opening the border until border crossings have weigh scales

and until there is an accessible database to allow for monitoring the safety performance

of all Mexican firms applying for certificates to operate in the United States.</p>



<p>The House voted by an overwhelming majority to prohibit any funding to allow operating

certificates for Mexican trucks. (A House committee previously rejected a proposal similar

to today&#146;s measure.) By contrast, the provisions approved today are affirmative

efforts to improve the safety of these vehicles, and we urge the full Senate to approve

them.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that the NAFTA arbitration panel said that the United

States is not required to treat applications from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the

same manner as from United States or Canadian firms, as long as they are reviewed on a

case-by-case basis and it is acknowledged that U.S. authorities are responsible for the

safe operations of trucks within this country, whether the ownership of the trucks is

United States, Canadian or Mexican.</p>
