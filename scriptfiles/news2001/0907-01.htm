Coordinator for the African and African Descendants Caucus, one of the main 

caucuses of the conference in Durban, Brown said today: "Colonization and 

slavery should be considered crimes against humanity, and African 

descendants should have rights of reparations.... We also need to address 

the economic basis of racism and a colonial history that has led to 

marginalization and impoverishment."

Toure is a columnist for The Black World Today, a former anti-apartheid 

activist and editor of the HYPE Information Service, which distributes news 

of black interest to media outlets. He said today: "The anti-racism 

struggle is going to continue no matter what comes out of Durban. The idea 

that the U.S. pulling out makes the conference a failure is itself a racist 

notion."

Professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of 

Law, Boyle said today: "The U.S. and Europe should not be allowed to use 

the Mideast to avoid seriously addressing the legacy of colonialism and 

slavery. Africans and their descendants are rightfully owed reparations. 

Rather than distracting from each other, it's important to see that Israeli 

practices are a continuation of colonialism -- settler colonialism -- and 

have a great deal in common with the European imperialism in the last 

half-millennium which we should at long last account for."

<BR>

Co-director of the Global Justice Center based in Brazil, Cavallaro is in 

South Africa until Sept. 9. He said: "There are many, many important issues 

other than the one the U.S. government is using as the basis of its 

withdrawal -- or downgrading its status -- from the conference. The U.S. 

doesn't want to discuss slavery, Jim Crow laws and colonialism, and it 

seems to have taken the issue of the Mideast as a pretext to pull out. A 

major issue is how the legacies of racism are related to current inequities 

between different racial and ethnic groups around the world. There is a 

large block of countries questioning the nature of the relationship between 

the wealthy and the poor countries -- of how neo-liberal corporate 

globalization and racism are related. The economic gap under the 

neo-liberal model has increased along racial lines."

<BR>

George is director of the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center. (Much of the 

center's membership lives in the congressional district of Rep. Tom 

Lantos.) George said today: "Once Lantos was put in charge of the U.S. 

delegation, it was inevitable that it would withdraw. He sponsored a 

resolution in the House not to send Powell to the conference.... Lantos is 

Israel's point person in Congress."
