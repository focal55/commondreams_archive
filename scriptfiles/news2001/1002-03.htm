<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 2 -The Sierra Club today thanked the Senate for voting to

keep inappropriate and untimely amendments out of the Defense Authorization

Bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're thankful that the Senate is acknowledging that this fall is not the

time to debate controversial energy policies, including drilling in the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the

Sierra Club. &quot;In a unanimous vote, the Senate said that it would be

inappropriate to exploit the tragedy our nation faces for personal

political agendas or divisive issues. Our country must focus our attention

now on issues of national security, personal safety and healing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate today defeated attempts to attach controversial and

inappropriate energy amendments, which included provisions to drill in the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and give subsidies to polluting energy

industries, to the Defense Authorization bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will not promote national

security or develop stable and environmentally acceptable energy supplies

because it would take a least 10 years to produce even a drop of oil.  In

addition, the U.S. Geological Survey says that the Arctic Refuge would

provide less than a 180-day supply of oil for the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The safest and fastest way to increase America's energy security is to

increase the energy efficiency of our cars, SUV's, homes, factories,

offices and appliances, and to increase reliance on renewable energy

sources such as wind and solar power.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope that the Senate will continue to support protecting the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge and oppose those who would try to take advantage

or our national crisis to push their controversial and irresponsible

policies,&quot; Pope said.</font></p>
