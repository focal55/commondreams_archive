- February 27 - The Sierra Club hailed today's Supreme Court ruling as a major

victory for the Clean Air Act, one of our nation's most successful

environmental and public health laws.  The Court upheld the way the U.S.

EPA sets clean air standards by affirming that air quality requirements should be based on public health.

<p>

"Today the Supreme Court stood up to protect the more than 100 million

Americans who continue to breathe unhealthy air," said Ed Hopkins, Director

of Sierra Club's Environmental Quality Program.  Hopkins continued,  "The

1997 soot and smog standards upheld by the Court today will provide greater

protection to children and people with asthma and other lung diseases, who

are particularly vulnerable to dangerous soot and smog."

<p>

With respect to the new soot standard, the Supreme Court rejected all

industry-led challenges. "The new soot standard will save more than 10,000

lives each year. We urge EPA to move quickly to implement these vital

standards," said Hopkins.

<p>

While the Court did not question the science behind the new smog standard

it did, however, require the EPA to develop a new procedure to implement

the standard.

<p>

As part of updating the Clean Air Act to reflect current scientific

knowledge, President Clinton in 1997 announced new health-based air

standards for soot and smog. Soon after the new health-based air quality

standards were finalized in 1997, industry, led by the American Trucking

Association, filed a lawsuit to halt these efforts to clean the air. On May

14, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled against the EPA, leaving the fate

of the new standards in limbo.

<p>

"Efforts to destroy the soot and smog standards, led by the American

Trucking Association, were part of industry's latest attempts to weaken clean air protections over the last 30 years. This is a huge victory for

the Clean Air Act and a major setback for polluters that will need to clean

up their act," explained Ed Hopkins, "The EPA now must step forward to

implement the new soot standard and develop a plan to move forward on the

smog standard to protect all Americans from dirty air."
