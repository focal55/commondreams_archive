<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OAKLAND, CA - August 27 - Genetically engineered crops cost more and produce less, are environmentally risky, and may eclipse more affordable and practical alternatives, claims a new scientific report released by the food policy think tank, Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Biotechnology companies and associated scientific bodies are making false promises that genetic engineering will move agriculture away from a dependence on chemical inputs, reduce environmental problems, and solve world hunger," writes University of California biologist and author of the report, Dr. Miguel Altieri. "Such promises are founded on philosophical and scientific premises that are fundamentally flawed, and need to be exposed." </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report documents how genetically engineered (GE) crops are little more than a technological band-aid solution to the environmental problems of agriculture.  For example, insect-resistant GE crops reduce agricultural problems to single gene solutions in the same way the Green Revolution reduced pest control to single pesticide solutions, overlooking the pest's ability to develop resistance to these pesticides. At the same time, these external chemical inputs are prohibitively expensive for most farmers in poor countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other findings of the report include:</font></p>

<ul>

 

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Golden Rice is not a viable solution to Vitamin A deficiency.

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringeinsus, widely used to fight pests in organic farming, could be rendered useless because of its genetic introduction into GE corn; thus potentially building resistance in the pests it is supposed to control. 

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Illinois, genetically modified herbicide resistant soybean seed and weed management systems were the most expensive in modern history, doubling costs for farmers in three years.

</font>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report advocates for "agroecological" technologies, developed by farmers, local governments, and non-profits throughout the world. These technologies are being eclipsed by the mad rush to do research on genetic engineering. The report argues for a major push to "upscale" these alternatives through changes in policies, research institutions and resource allocations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report also contains a complete glossary of terms and a web resource guide on genetic engineering. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Miguel Altieri is Professor of Insect Biology and member of the Center for Biological Control at the University of California at Berkeley.  He serves as Vice President of the Board of Trustees of Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy. </font></p>
