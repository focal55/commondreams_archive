- December 12 - As House passage of the Ney-Hoyer election reform legislation shows, reforms to strengthen our democracy fit naturally into the congressional agenda during this national crisis. Americans have the right to make their votes and voices count equally. To do that we need to fix our election systems and improve election administration, and we must also reduce the corrosive effect of big money in politics. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House passage of election reform is a positive step toward making every vote count. Thanks in part to an unfair rule prohibiting any amendment, the legislation does not go far enough to prevent another crisis like Florida's presidential vote. The Senate must now strengthen provisions to enforce minimum standards for state elections. Common Cause will work with the civil rights community, disability groups, and the League of Women Voters to pass stronger legislation in the Senate and enact it into law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's debate sets a strong precedent for the full House of Representatives to take up the bipartisan Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill. Unlike Ney-Hoyer, the Shays-Meehan bill has already passed the House in two previous Congresses, and its Senate counterpart passed in April. Two hundred and ten members have called for a vote, and a majority is likely to again pass it in the House, given a fair opportunity. The House leadership should schedule a vote under a fair procedure and failing that, only eight additional signatures are needed to do so. Members of the House who want to strengthen our democracy by reforming elections should take the next step to level the playing field, by signing the discharge petition and then voting to pass Shays-Meehan. </font></p>
