- January 16 - Kweisi Mfume, president

&amp; CEO, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People (NAACP), said today that information campaigns will be

conducted in states of U.S. Senators who vote to confirm the

nomination of John Ashcroft for U.S. Attorney General.

<p>"Senators who vote for Ashcroft will not be able to run away

from this and assume people will forget," said Mfume. "We are

going to fund major information campaigns for the next four years

in states where senators voted to confirm. For democratic

senators, in particular, this vote comes as close to a litmus test

as one can get on the issue of civil rights and equal justice under

law from the party's most loyal constituency."

<p>Mfume said the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee should reject the

Ashcroft nomination because he has not proven he will enforce laws

with which he disagrees and because of his extremist ideology. "We

challenge the U.S. Senate to ask Ashcroft the hard questions that

speak to his history of bending the law to conform to his

particular ideology," said Mfume. "This is a time for conscious,

not congeniality among senators," he said. "The Senate should also

press Ashcroft to explain why he opposed efforts to increase voter

registration in St. Louis and why he opposed voluntary school

desegregation in St. Louis."

<p>Mfume said the Senate would have no choice but to reject

Ashcroft after a careful review of his record. Ashcroft received

a grade of "F" on each of the last three legislative NAACP report

cards having voted to approve only three of 15 legislative issues

supported by the NAACP and other civil rights groups.

<p>"The Attorney General of the United States is responsible for

enforcing our nation's hate crimes law, but Ashcroft voted in the

senate to oppose the Hate Crimes Prevention Act," said Mfume.

"Clearly, Ashcroft is a man who will not hesitate to bend the rules

to conform to his ideology."

<p>The Ashcroft nomination represents a major test for U.S.

Senators who believe in the Constitution, equal opportunity laws,

human and voting rights for all citizens, said Mfume. "The

policies that Ashcroft has committed his national career towards

implementing are so divisive they are not only antithetical to the

necessary virtues of an effective U.S. Attorney General, but they

are also antithetical to the stated philosophy of President-elect

Bush, who said he wants to be a uniter, not a divider."

<p>Ashcroft demonstrated contempt for the history and conditions of

African Americans and other Americans of color by making public

comments issued in 1998 in Southern Partisan Magazine praising

Confederate leaders Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson

Davis who fought to preserve the cruel and inhumane institution of

slavery.

<p>Ashcroft also opposed the nomination of Bill Lann Lee as

Assistant U.S. Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights

Division. He also opposes background checks for gun purchases and

supports the death penalty.

<p><i>Founded in 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People (NAACP) is the nation's oldest and largest civil

rights organization. Its half-million adult and youth members

throughout the United States and the world are the premier

advocates for civil rights in their communities, conducting voter

mobilization and monitoring equal opportunity in the public and

private sectors. </i>
