- April 19 - Demonstrating significant support for going &quot;Beyond Petroleum,&quot; more than 7% of BP shareholders supported a climate change resolution at today&#146;s Annual Meeting in London. The resolution called on BP Amoco to transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable sources of energy like solar power, and criticized the company&#146;s stated desire to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;BP should listen to its shareholders and finally go Beyond Petroleum,&quot; said Athan Manuel, director of the Public Interest Research Group&#146;s (PIRG) Arctic Wilderness Campaign. &quot;The best way for the company to do that is to cancel plans to drill in the Arctic Refuge and go solar.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of PIRG activists attended the meeting and spoke in favor of the climate change resolution. The activists challenged BP to act like a good corporate citizen by respecting the rights of the Gwich'in- an indigenous people who live near the Arctic Refuge- by canceling plans to drill there. At the meeting, activists compared drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the crown jewel of America&#146;s Arctic, to drilling in Buckingham Palace, and cautioned shareholders that consumers in Canada and America will punish BP if it drills in the Refuge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PIRG and a coalition of 131 environmental groups, investors and religious organizations filed a resolution in January calling on BP to rethink its plans for drilling in the Refuge. The resolution, which received support from an unprecedented thirteen percent of shareholders at last year&#146;s meeting, was rejected by BP on technical grounds. BP contended that U.S. owners of American Depository Shares do not have the same rights to file shareholder resolutions as investors with ordinary shares in the United Kingdom.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Manuel remained determined, however. &quot;We are going to keep pushing BP to stay out of the Arctic and go solar, year after year,&quot; he said.</font></p>
