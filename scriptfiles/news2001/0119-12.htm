- January 19 - Kweisi Mfume, President

&amp; CEO, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People (NAACP) today urged citizens to participate in a march and

rally in Tallahassee, Florida tomorrow January 20, 2001. The

purpose of the march is to allow citizens the ability to continue

to express their concern and outrage over voting irregularities

that occurred in the recent presidential election.

<p>Mfume said: "The inauguration provides us with the perfect

juxtaposition to remind America of the need for a nationwide

uniform system of casting and counting ballots. It also gives us

pause to reflect again on all of the alleged irregularities that

prevented or discouraged people from voting. We congratulate Mr.

Bush on his inauguration and wish him well in his attempts to now

lead our nation. However, we also call upon him to use the bully

pulpit of his new office to work for and support both judicial and

legislative remedies."

<p>The march and rally will be held at noon on Inauguration Day,

Saturday, January 20 on the steps of the state capital located at

Pensacola and Madison Streets in Tallahassee, Florida.

Co-sponsoring organizations include the Black Leadership Forum,

Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, AFL-CIO, Coalition of Conscience,

Congressional Black Caucus, Florida Chapter-Sierra Club, Interfaith

Alliance, National Council of Negro Women, National Organization

for Women, and the Florida Youth Movement.

<p><i>Founded in 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People (NAACP) is the nation's oldest and largest civil

rights organization. Its half-million adult and youth members

throughout the United States and the world are the premier

advocates for civil rights in their communities, conducting voter

mobilization and monitoring equal opportunity in the public and

private sectors. </i>
