- May 24 - &quot;STAR WARS RETURNS,&quot; a video documentary exposing how the Bush

administration is moving to make space a new arena of war, in violation of

the

intent of international law, has just been released by EnviroVideo.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documentary is being distributed in the U.S. and around the world.&quot;STAR WARS RETURNS&quot; is narrated and was written by investigative reporter

and

journalism Professor Karl Grossman, directed and edited by Emmy Award-winner

Steve Jambeck and produced by Joan Flynn.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It presents U.S. military documents setting forth U.S. plans to &quot;control

space&quot; and from space &quot;dominate&quot; the earth below. It reveals the

multi-billion

dollar U.S. development program now underway to produce space-based laser

weapons, and that far more than &quot;missile defense&quot; is involved. It also

details the

international opposition to the U.S. Star Wars program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;STAR WARS RETURNS&quot; explores the recently issued report of the Space

Commission chaired by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld which calls for

U.S. &quot;power projection in, from and through space&quot; and declares: &quot;In the

coming period the U.S. will conduct operations to, from, in and through

space in support of its national interests both on earth and in space.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Senator Bob Smith, who wrote the legislation establishing the Rumsfeld

Space Commission, asserts in &quot;STAR WARS RETURNS&quot; about U.S. &quot;control&quot; of

space: &quot;It is our manifest destiny. You know we went from the East Coast to

the West Coast of the United States of America settling the continent and

they call that

manifest destiny and the next continent if you will, the next frontier, is

space and it goes on forever.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Others appearing in &quot;STAR WARS RETURNS&quot; are Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the

Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in Space; Rear Admiral

Eugene Carroll (USN, ret.), vice president of the Center for Defense

Information;

Congressman Dennis Kucinich; physicist Dr. Vandana Shiva of India; Bill

Sulzman, director of Citizens for Peace in Space; Dr. Michio Kaku, professor

of

theoretical physics at the City University of New York; editor Loring

Wirbel;

and Regina Hagen, a Global Network director.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also interviewed is Craig Eisendrath who as a U.S. State Department

officer was central in drafting the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 the intent

of which the U.S. is now preparing to violate, charges Eisendrath in &quot;STAR

WARS RETURNS.&quot; It is the basic international law on space, ratified by most

countries of the world, and sets space aside for &quot;peaceful purposes.&quot;

EnviroVideo has produced 175 television programs including the award-winning

documentary  &quot;NUKES IN SPACE: THE NUCLEARIZATION AND WEAPONIZATION OF THE

HEAVENS.&quot;</font></p>
