- April 12 - The pharmaceutical industry&#146;s status as the most

profitable industry in 2000 makes its opposition to Medicare prescription drug coverage

unconscionable, Public Citizen said today.

<p>The drug industry this week<b> </b>was named &quot;more profitable than any other&quot;

by <i>Fortune</i> in its new Fortune 500 analysis of America&#146;s most successful

companies and industries in 2000. The industry was also rated the most profitable industry

last year and has been consistently ranked number one or two by <i>Fortune</i> over the

past few decades. </p>



<p>The <i>Fortune</i> report shows that the 11 drug companies in the Fortune 500 enjoyed

rates of profitability (measured in return on revenue) that were three to four times

greater than the median for all industries in the Fortune 500. Pfizer, the second-largest

drug company, has seen the value of its stock increase a stunning 1,454 percent over the

last decade.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/drugs/factshts/mostprofitable.htm">Public

Citizen conducted additional analysis</a> of the 11<b> </b>drug companies&#146; annual

financial reports. <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/drugs/factshts/mostprofitable.htm">The analysis</a>

shows that profits &#150; not research and development of new medicines &#150; were the

top priority for drug companies. Public Citizen found that Fortune 500 drug companies

plowed 30 percent of their revenues into marketing and administration, while committing

just 12 percent of revenues to research and development. Seventeen percent of the revenues

represented profit.</p>



<p>&quot;Given the druggernaut&#146;s extraordinary profits, it&#146;s laughable that the

industry &#150; and the congressional leadership in Washington, D.C. &#150; have fiercely

opposed prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program for fear it would lead to

price discounts,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Congress

Watch. </p>



<p>The drug industry has spent tens of millions of dollars in recent years to lobby

against a Medicare prescription drug benefit because it might lead to price discounts as

the federal government becomes a bulk buyer for millions of American seniors. </p>



<p>&quot;The drug industry&#146;s insistence on price-gouging appears all the more greedy

when you consider that the industry&#146;s profitability is largely based on federal

government assistance in the form of monopoly patents, taxpayer-funded research and huge

tax breaks,&quot; Clemente said.</p>



<p>Public Citizen&#146;s analysis also found that:



<ul>

  <li>The largest American drug company, Merck, had profits of $6.8 billion in 2000, which was

    more than the profits of all the Fortune 500 companies in the airline, entertainment, food

    production, metals and hotel/casino/resorts industries <i>combined</i>. </li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>Fortune 500 drug companies saw the value of their stock increase by 38 percent last

    year, as investors turned to these steady profit-generators during the stock market

    turbulence in 2000. Drug stocks have tended to be impervious to market gyrations and

    perform well during economic downturns.</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>The drug industry&#146;s success in Fortune 500 profitability rankings has become a rite

    of spring. In the 1970s and 1980s, Fortune 500 drug companies enjoyed rates of return on

    revenue that were two times greater than the median for all industries in the Fortune 500.

    In the 1990s, the drug industry&#146;s rates of return on revenue were almost four times

    greater than the median for all industries in the Fortune 500. </li>

</ul>
