- February 14 - The Union of Concerned Scientists today  joined in the release of <i>Repowering the  Midwest</i>, a blueprint for clean electricity  production in America's heartland. The report  builds on UCS's 1993 landmark report <i>Powering  the Midwest</i>, which examined the potential for  renewable energy -- wind, solar, and biomass  resources -- to meet energy needs and provide  new economic development opportunities for  the Midwest.

<p>The new report, coordinated and published by the Environmental Law & Policy Center, shows  policymakers, industry and citizens how to  combine renewable energy sources with energy  efficiency improvements to the existing  electricity system and with new low-emission  natural gas power plants into a comprehensive  clean energy development plan. Renewable  energy would provide at least eight percent  of the region's electricity generation by  2010 and 22 percent by 2020. Sulfur dioxide  pollution, which causes acid rain, would be  cut by 56 percent; nitrogen oxide pollution,  which causes smog, by 71 percent; and carbon  dioxide pollution, which causes global  warming, by 51 percent.  </p>



<p>"The report shows how clean energy production  can make economic and environmental sense,"  said Alan Nogee, Director of UCS's Clean  Energy Program and a member of the report's  steering committee. "California took a detour  from this path in the 1990s, and is now  paying a heavy price in power shortages and  higher prices. This report can help the  region and the nation avoid making  California's mistakes. We can have reliable  and affordable energy supplies while cleaning  up the environment." </p>



<p>Nogee notes that during the California  deregulation debate, the state's utilities  slashed energy conservation and renewable  energy programs similar to those recommended  in <i>Repowering the Midwest</i>. "California  utilities cut their energy efficiency  programs in half, and persuaded federal  regulators to kill a state program to develop  renewable energy sources," said Nogee.  "Gutting these California programs eliminated  the equivalent of 3,200 megawatts of planned  power plant capacity-enough to serve 3.2  million homes-and contributed to today's  power shortages and higher electricity  prices." </p>



<p>"We need a national energy policy that puts  energy efficiency and clean renewable energy  development first," said Nogee.  <i>Repowering  the Midwest</i> recommends federal and regional  policies to enact:<br><br>



<li>minimum standards for energy suppliers to  meet a growing fraction of their energy from  renewable energy sources;<br><br>

<li>public benefit funds to invest in energy  efficiency improvements and the development  of new, clean, and renewable energy technologies;<br><br>

<li>more stringent energy efficiency standards  and building codes; · incentives for electricity customers to  install clean, distributed electricity  generators; and<br><br>

<li>fair pollution rules that would eliminate  grandfathering of old, dirty coal plants. <br>
