Director of The Shalom Center, Waskow said today: "Shortly before the latest suicide bombings, the mass-circulation right-of-center Israeli newspaper <I>Yediot Achronot</I> ran a prominent front-page analysis pointing out that Hamas had suspended suicide

bombings, but was sure to return to them, since Sharon had once again turned to

assassinating Hamas' leaders. Surely Sharon knew this as well. What is really

going on here is a conspiracy of right-wingers -- Palestinian and Israeli,

Hamas and Sharon -- to shatter any chance of peace. Sharon thinks if he does

that, the result will be permanent Israeli control over the West Bank, and

probably the piece-by-piece expulsion of the Palestinians. Hamas thinks that

over a longer time, the result will be the shattering of Israel. Of course,

this analysis does not lessen the horror and inhumanity of the suicide

bombings. They are inexcusable -- as is Sharon's callous attitude toward

Israeli and Palestinian lives."

Sharoni, professor of peace and conflict studies and Middle East politics at Evergreen State

College, is executive director of the Consortium on Peace Research, Education

and Development. On an August 3 news release from IPA, she said: "The

targeted assassinations campaign against Palestinian leaders is likely to provoke

a violent response. In fact, one wonders if Israel is using these illegal

attacks to provoke such a response and then use that as a pretext to reoccupy

the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip." She said today: "Sharon is

trying to use the suicide bombings to re-occupy the West Bank and Gaza."

Professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, Boyle said

today: "Israel is acting in total violation of international law,

including UN resolutions that allowed it into the UN in the first place. If

something is not done quite soon to stop Israeli war crimes and crimes against

humanity against the Palestinians, it could very well degenerate into genocide,

literally fit that legal definition -- if Israel is not there already. In this

regard, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is what international lawyers call

a genocidaire -- one who has already committed genocide in the past. There is

currently a criminal case against Sharon in Belgium, using the Pinochet principle,

for his role in the Sabra and Shatila massacres against Palestinian refugees.

Sharon is ready, willing, and able to inflict genocide yet again upon the

Palestinians."

An independent journalist and analyst who has written extensively about the Mideast, Andoni said today: "Israel is sending a message: Either the Palestinian leadership does the

dirty work for Israel of repressing the Palestinian people, or it will be

eliminated."
