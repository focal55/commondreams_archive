- November 5 - The Sustainable Energy 

Coalition (SEC) commends Senator Harkin for his leadership as 

Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee in introducing a 

comprehensive energy title to the 2002 Farm Bill. The legislation 

would promote greater energy efficiency on America's farms, and 

spur the development of renewable energy resources such as biomass, 

geothermal, solar, and wind. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;America's farmers can be at the forefront of renewable energy 

development, utilizing the commodities they grow, and even the 

waste streams they now must dispose of, in innovative new ways to 

produce power, transportation fuels, and a new generation of 

biobased products and chemicals,&quot; said Carol Werner, Executive 

Director of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. 

&quot;Developing our nation's on-farm renewable resources is key to 

diversifying our energy market, enhancing national security, 

protecting our environment, and revitalizing rural America -- truly 

a 'win-win-win' opportunity that is good for American farmers and 

good for the country.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Renewable energy, environmental enhancement and agriculture are 

a natural 'combination' and we are grateful that Senator Harkin 

translated this combination into legislative action,&quot; added Bill 

Holmberg, President of Biorefiner. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. Harkin's proposal: 

-- Establishes a biobased product purchasing requirement for 

federal agencies; 

-- Creates a program to administer farmer, rancher and rural 

small business energy audits and renewable energy development 

assessments; 

-- Provides financial and technical assistance to farmers, 

ranchers and rural small businesses for renewable energy systems 

and energy efficiency improvements; 

-- Provides grants for the commercialization of cellulosic 

ethanol and the establishment of biorefineries for the production 

of transportation fuels and a variety of marketable chemicals and 

biobased products; 

-- Extends the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 to 

2006; 

-- Expresses the sense of the Senate that a national renewable 

fuels standard should be enacted under law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The energy title has great benefits both for clean energy and 

farmers. &quot;Senator Harkin's energy title opens up a tremendous 

opportunity for farmers to utilize the sun in other ways besides 

growing crops,&quot; stated Glenn Hamer, Executive Director for the 

Solar Energy Industries Association. &quot;The sun's power can be 

harnessed in many cost-effective off-grid solar applications, such 

as pumping water for irrigation or livestock.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Farmers have already begun to profit from wind energy 

development,&quot; said Randy Swisher, Executive Director of the 

American Wind Energy Association. &quot;Just as farmers and ranchers now 

provide our nation with food and fiber, they can also provide us 

with clean sustainable energy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Farmers can benefit directly from incentives given to producing 

power and fuels from biomass,&quot; says Katherine Hamilton, Co-Director 

of the American Bioenergy Association. &quot;Senator Harkin has linked 

agricultural economics to clean energy and fuels, an important step 

toward strengthening our national energy security.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Sustainable Energy Coalition brings together more than 30 

national business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy 

organizations. Founded in 1992, the Coalition promotes increased 

federal support for energy efficiency and renewable energy 

technologies and reduced federal support for unsafe or polluting 

energy resources. Coalition members advocate federal energy 

policies that will lead to a cleaner environment, safe reliable 

energy technologies, and a secure, prosperous future for all 

Americans.
