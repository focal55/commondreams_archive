- May 16 - Consumers Union (CU), 

  the nonprofit publisher of <i>Consumer Reports</i>, today said that the Bush 

  Administration's upcoming proposal for a national energy policy fails to address 

  consumers' most pressing energy concerns - high electricity, natural gas and 

  gasoline prices. Instead, in a show of misplaced priorities, the proposal will 

  focus on using more fossil fuels and shortchange renewable energy sources and 

  conservation programs. The industry-dominated task force, chaired by Vice President 

  Cheney, has met in secret for the last several months, but information about 

  the contents of the plan has been leaking out for some time. According to CU's 

  analysis:</font>



<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">The plan does nothing about the 

    fact that the electricity market isn't working properly. Electric deregulation 

    has made the market increasingly dysfunctional, which allows the energy industry 

    to manipulate the supply and distribution of electricity. There are strong 

    indications that energy companies are taking unfair advantage of the market 

    in order to charge inflated prices and reap massive profits. The California 

    Independent System Operator found that wholesalers had overcharged California 

    utilities $6.3 billion. The Administration's hands-off approach to energy 

    prices leaves consumers paying record-high bills this summer. People are justifiably 

    concerned that energy companies are getting away with price gouging, and this 

    plan does nothing to alleviate their concerns. </font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;The energy market does not 

  reflect true competitive forces,&quot; said Adam Goldberg, a policy analyst 

  in CU's Washington Office. &quot;Simply adding supply to a dysfunctional market 

  doesn't fix the market. We had hoped that the task force would address the market 

  failures that have inflated gasoline, natural gas and electricity prices far 

  above reasonable levels. Instead we have a proposal that protects the oil and 

  gas industries' bloated profits, compromises the environment, and fails to encourage 

  meaningful energy conservation,&quot; Goldberg added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Consumers in California and 

  across the nation are facing a serious electricity crisis this summer,&quot; 

  said Harry Snyder, a senior advocate with CU's West Coast Office. &quot;Unfortunately, 

  the Vice President's task force seems more interested in drilling and digging 

  than dealing with our current problems. The Bush Administration must provide 

  consumers with immediate relief by taking aggressive action to address blatant 

  energy industry price gouging.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">&quot;Consumers believe that increased 

  energy production is necessary,&quot; said Janee Briesemeister, a senior policy 

  analyst with CU's Southwest Regional office, &quot;but the emphasis should be 

  on diversifying our energy portfolio through greater investment in renewable 

  energy sources. Studies have shown that conservation measures, such as energy 

  efficiency standards for autos and major appliances, have been a success. Energy 

  efficiency has the added benefit of lowering household utility bills. That's 

  why the Bush Administration should reverse its recent decision to back away 

  from energy efficiency standards for air conditioners. Efficiency standards 

  should be developed or strengthened for other products as part of a long term 

  strategy to lower consumption.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">CU has several concerns about the 

  task force report: </font></p>

<blockquote> 

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">&middot; <b>Electricity 

    Prices</b>. The plan will do nothing to meet the immediate concern 

    of consumers - the high price of electricity. Neither competition nor regulatory 

    tools are providing market discipline to prevent unwarranted price increases. 

    The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) - the agency charged with 

    ensuring just and reasonable wholesale electricity prices - must crack down 

    on price gouging to rectify the situation. If the market can't regulate prices 

    properly, and FERC refuses to, Congress and the Executive Branch must step 

    in to deal with this crisis. So far, neither has. This plan does not change 

    that.<br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Fossil Fuels And The Environment</b>. 

    The report is expected to call for more drilling in national parks and sensitive 

    wilderness areas. While CU believes that increased domestic energy production 

    is necessary, it would not be in consumers' best interests to compromise the 

    nation's environmental standards to marginally increase fuel supplies.<br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Production Versus Conservation</b>. 

    Primary reliance on increased production while downplaying conservation is 

    a mistake. As consumers focus on energy needs and are looking for ways to 

    save, the time is promising to promote alternative fuel sources and conservation 

    efforts. The Department of Energy's own estimates are that energy efficiency 

    and expanded renewable capacity could meet up to 60 percent of the nation's 

    expected increased energy needs between now and 2020.<br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Emphasis On Supply Over Demand</b>. 

    It is unrealistic to think the U.S. can build its way out of the energy crisis. 

    A comprehensive strategy must focus on the long- and short-term future. Energy 

    policy should address both supply and demand and balance production with continued 

    environmental protection. The plan's emphasis on supply creates the false 

    impression that environmental laws are at fault for energy price spikes. The 

    real culprits are the very industry executives who met with Vice President 

    Cheney behind closed doors to develop this plan. Lawsuits have been filed 

    in California against electricity generators who allegedly manipulated the 

    market to create artificial shortages and pad their profits. <br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Building More Power Plants, Transmission 

    Lines and Pipelines</b>. Any effort to increase generation capacity 

    and delivery systems should not be made at the expense of the environment. 

    In addition, electricity transactions on the interstate transmission system 

    need to be made transparent to prevent bottlenecks that cost consumers money. 

    <br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Renewable Energy Sources</b>. The 

    task force seems fixated on fossil fuels and unwilling to recognize the full 

    potential of renewable energy sources like wind, water and solar power seriously. 

    Recent developments have made these alternative energy sources more economically 

    viable. Given the state of the crisis, we should be paying closer attention 

    to these sources to avoid future shortages and price spikes. <br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Nuclear Power And Coal</b>. The proposal 

    calls for the construction of new nuclear power plants. There are still many 

    unanswered questions about waste disposal, safety, and the economics of building 

    such plants to rely on new nuclear capacity in the near or medium term. Coal 

    is inherently a dirty fuel source. Attempts to expand its use to generate 

    electricity must be tied to efforts to improve air quality, not weaken it.<br>

    <br>

    &middot; <b>Gasoline Prices And Energy Efficiency</b>. 

    While refining capacity is inadequate, it is not good enough to say that we 

    simply need to build more refineries. The plan will apparently promote the 

    purchase of hybrid automobiles that run on both gasoline and electricity. 

    CU supports such a goal. But other energy efficiency measures are also needed, 

    including promotion of more energy efficient air conditioners and an increase 

    in automobile fuel efficiency standards. </font></p>
