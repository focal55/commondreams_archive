- December 3 - The Bush Administration today bowed to pressure from

giant factory farmers and turned its back on California's breathing

public. Rather than requiring the largest California farms to play by

the same rules as every other industry, the Environmental Protection

Agency (&quot;EPA&quot;) allowed the state to continue exempting all farming

operations from clean air permitting requirements. This means that air

pollution from the Central Valley's largest farms - from such sources as

giant diesel irrigation pumps - will continue to spew, unmonitored and

without permits into the Valley's air. Because of the influence

industrial agriculture has on the Administration, they will continue to

enjoy immunity from clean air requirements, while identical pollution

sources on neighboring oil fields (or any other industry) have to obtain

permits which limit the amount of pollution they can emit.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Medical professionals who treat thousands of Valley residents suffering

from pollution-related respiratory problems were shocked. Dr. David

Pepper of the Medical Alliance for Healthy Air said, &quot;This is an

outrage. Our patients are suffering. The EPA should to come to my

clinic, visit with an asthmatic child, and then explain to the parents

why they are letting air quality worsen and favoring giant factory farms

over the health of children.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earthjustice lawyer, Bruce Nilles, vowed to investigate all legal

options to overturn this decision. &quot;The Administration is playing

special interest politics, putting the health of California residents at

great risk. This is patently illegal. We are consulting with medical

professionals and community groups about the appropriate legal

response,&quot; said Nilles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal law provides that EPA's decision may be appealed in the Federal

Court of Appeals within sixty days. Earthjustice is currently

representing a coalition of medical, community and environmental groups

in another lawsuit against EPA for its multiple failures to take action

to improve air quality in the San Joaquin Valley. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BACKGROUND ON TITLE V</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Today EPA granted final approval to the Title V operating

permits program for all 35 California Air Districts despite a state law

exemption under state law for &quot;any equipment used in agricultural

operations in the growing of crops or the raising of fowl or animals&quot;

Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;42310(e).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	EPA is action is illegal. The Act explicitly states that &quot;the

Administrator may not exempt any major source from such [permitting]

requirements.&quot; 42 U.S.C. &sect; 7661a(a). This clear requirement admits no

exception and EPA's notice fails to provide a legal justification for

creating one. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	For the past five years EPA had consistently maintained the

position that the State of California must remove its statutory

exemption for agriculture before EPA can grant full approval to the

State's Title V program. See, e.g., 59 Fed. Reg. 60939, 60942-43 (Nov.

29, 1994) (&quot;In order for this program to receive full approval (and

avoid a disapproval upon the expiration of this interim approval), the

California Legislature must revise the Health and Safety Code to

eliminate the exemption of agricultural sources from the requirement to

obtain a permit.&quot;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	In a March 2001 legal opinion about the adequacy of the state's

permitting program, Attorney General Bill Lockyer agreed that the

agricultural exemption is inconsistent with Title V.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[I]t is my opinion that the laws of California provide adequate legal

authority to carry out all aspects of the [Title V permit operating]

program. . . with one exception... The one exception to the state's

authority to issue permits to all air pollution sources concerns

'equipment used in agricultural operations in the growing of crops or

the raising of fowl or animals.' Section 42310(e) of the HSC [Health and

Safety Code] currently exempts these potential Title V sources from the

permit requirement. In the event the legislature remedies this provision

to eliminate the exemption for agricultural equipment that emits

sufficient quantities of air contaminant to be a Title V source, we will

amend this opinion accordingly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excerpts from letter by California Attorney General Lockyer to U.S. EPA

Administrator Whitman, March 21, 2001: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	Title V of the Clean Air Act requires &quot;major sources&quot; of air

pollution to obtain a permit that details all the environmental

protections that must be installed on a pollution source, as well as the

monitoring obligations necessary to ensure the facility is in compliance

with applicable air quality standards. The permitting process also

provides an opportunity for public review and comment before a permit is

issued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Implications for San Joaquin Valley</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.	Under the San Joaquin Valley's new &quot;severe&quot; ozone nonattainment

status and its current &quot;serious&quot; PM-10 nonattainment status (the worst

possible PM-10 status), a &quot;major&quot; source required to obtain a permit is

defined as any source (or combination of sources located in a contiguous

area) emitting more than (1) 25 tons per year of NOx or VOCs; (2) 70

tons per year of PM-10 or PM-10 precursors; (3) 10 tons per year of a

hazardous air pollutant; or (4) more than 25 tons per year of any

combination of identified hazardous air pollutants&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.	Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)

combine to form Ozone (smog) pollution. Two months ago the San Joaquin

Air District ranked the top 25 sources of NOx and VOCs for the Valley in

1999. Farm equipment topped the list as the largest source of NOx

emissions, even higher than heavy duty diesel trucks. Agricultural

sources of VOCs ranked second (livestock waste), fourth

(pesticides/fertilizers) and fifth (agricultural and prescribed

burning).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.	In a 1996 report, the San Joaquin Valley Air District determined

there were approximately 2,830 diesel irrigation engines in the Valley,

that the average engine was 161 horsepower, and each engine was operated

for approximately 2,298 hours over a 12-month period, for a total of

369,978 horsepower hours. With a NOx emission rate of approximately 10

grams of NOx emitted per horsepower hour, each of these 161 horsepower

diesel engines each emitted more than four tons of NOx annually. The

report also concluded that the largest diesel engines (450 horsepower)

were operated for approximately 8,280 hours each year and thus emitted

41 tons of NOx in a twelve-month period. Thus, individual diesel

irrigation engines or clusters of such engines located in a contiguous

area emit substantially more than 25 tons of NOx per year. Without the

agricultural exemption, operators of these engines would be required to

obtain a Title V permit. In any other industry, these same engines are

currently required to obtain such a permit.
