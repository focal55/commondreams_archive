- May 7 - Rep. Nick Rahall, Sen. Maria Cantwell, Rep. Jay Inslee and other

members of Congress will join mining reform advocates at a press

conference this Wednesday to call on President Bush not to roll

back environmental and taxpayer protections on the hardrock mining

industry and to release new information on the public comments

submitted to the Administration during the comment period which

ended May 7. Twenty citizens from around the West whose lives would

be affected by the rollback in safeguards will be in attendance at

the news conference. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) has been invited.

<p>The Department of the Interior has proposed to reverse current

rules that would require mining companies to pay for clean-up of

their sites. The rules would also reduce toxic runoff into

waterways. The Clinton administration spent nearly four years

taking comments before approving the "3809 rules" just before

Clinton left office. But Interior Secretary Gale Norton has

proposed revoking the current regulations and returning to the old

rules, which enabled mining companies to avoid responsibility for

pollution they caused.

<p>The current rules would enable the federal government to

prohibit new mine sites on sensitive federal land and prevent

mining pollution, such as cyanide and arsenic, from contaminating

rivers and streams. The rules also would require companies to pay

for clean up.

<p>The mining industry was the chief beneficiary of the

administration's delay of safer standards for arsenic in drinking

water. The industry is responsible for 96 percent of all arsenic

pollution reported by U.S. industry. According to the federal Toxic

Release Inventory released this April, mining is the nation's

largest toxic polluter.
