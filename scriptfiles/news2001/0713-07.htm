- July 13 - Sources on Capitol Hill have indicated that President George W. Bush's faith-based initiative is headed to the floor in the House of Representatives, with a vote happening as early as Wednesday, July 18.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush initiative, introduced in the House as H.R. 7 by Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), cleared the committee process this week. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the nation's leading opponent of the initiative, is urging all Americans concerned with religious liberty to contact their representatives and ask that lawmakers reject the plan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The faith-based initiative represents an outrageous assault on religious liberty and civil rights,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;This is easily one of the most reckless and dangerous measures considered by Congress in many years. Anyone concerned with church-state separation should contact their House members and urge them to reject this misguided scheme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;H.R. 7 is burdened with a series of dramatic flaws that will do lasting damage to religious liberty,&quot; added Lynn. &quot;Bush's crusade is one of those rare proposals that harms virtually everyone affected by it. The initiative advocates publicly funded employment discrimination, it threatens the religious liberties of those in need, it jeopardizes the freedom and independence of America&#146;s faith communities and undermines the rights of all taxpayers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;H.R. 7 is a disastrous step in the wrong direction,&quot; Lynn concluded. &quot;I encourage everyone who wishes to protect the future of religious liberty to contact their representative and deliver a clear and simple message: Vote 'no' on H.R. 7.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
