Senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, for the last three weeks Bouckaert has been

interviewing five to ten Afghan refugees in Quetta and Peshawar daily. He said

today: "We have seen an increase in the impact of the bombing campaign on

the civilian population. There's a broader range of targets being hit -- the

International Committee of the Red Cross has been hit twice in Kabul and other

aid organizations have also been affected. It's clearly more than just radar

stations and airfields. I don't think that the U.S. is targeting civilians, but

some serious targeting errors are happening. A lot of the bombing is taking

place in the cities and so people are fleeing to the rural areas. That will

deplete the limited food supplies there and increase the likelihood of

famine." Human Rights Watch has just documented civilian deaths in two

Afghan villages caused by U.S. weaponry.

Former UN Assistant Secretary General, von Sponeck headed the UN "oil-for-food" program

until he resigned last year in protest over the continued sanctions on Iraq. On

a speaking tour in North America until November 11, von Sponeck said today:

"There's no evidence linking Iraq to the anthrax outbreak though some are

arguing that it is a likely suspect without offering evidence. Following this

path will only intensify the prospects of a silent suffering which has gone on

for 11 years. Iraq has polluted water, lack of medicine and malnutrition, all

due to the sanctions. The UN sanctions committee currently has 'holds'

preventing delivery of $4 billion of humanitarian supplies. It's clear that in

the case of Afghanistan, the so-called collateral damage that the international

community was told would not happen is now occurring."

Professor emeritus of nutrition at the University of Massachusetts and team leader for several Food and Nutrition Missions to Iraq for the UN agency Food and Agricultural

Organization, Pellett said today: "In both Afghanistan and Iraq, we are

seeing widespread malnutrition, especially of young children. Both have

external causes though there has been a drought throughout the region for

several years. In Iraq the 'oil-for-food' program is providing 2,200 calories

per day, but child malnutrition is mainly caused by the dilapidation in the

water and sanitation systems. Afghanistan is clearly much more of an emergency

situation and the required food aid, which even previously was barely coping,

is now massively disrupted by both the air strikes and large population

movements. Significant distribution of food will only be possible when agreed

pauses are made in the air campaign."

Coordinator of Voices in the Wilderness, a group which has openly violated the economic

sanctions against Iraq, Kelly said today: "In the past, U.S. officials

presented a simplistic view of foreign policy -- everything that went wrong in

Iraq was blamed on Saddam Hussein. Now we're seeing the same thing for

Afghanistan. The Pentagon has been bombing Iraq continuously and that has been

ignored; now we bomb Afghanistan with cluster bombs. Aid agencies warn us that

millions of people in Afghanistan face starvation. People in other parts of the

world will be watching their plight. There is no clear indication that the



military campaign against Afghanistan is going to dislodge the Taliban or the

Al-Queda network. If anything, it may strengthen the existing regime the way a

decade of economic sanctions on Iraq have strengthened Hussein's government."
