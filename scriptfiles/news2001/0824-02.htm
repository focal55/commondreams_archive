- August 24 - While the West burns, a new government list of communities 

                    supposedly threatened by wildfires targets areas with much 

                    lower fire risk thousands of miles away.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Knowing 

                    which communities are at risk is crucial to developing an 

                    effective strategy to prevent wildfire damage,&quot; said 

                    Jonathan Oppenheimer, forest expert at Taxpayers for Common 

                    Sense, and a leading critic of federal wildfire policy. &quot;Unfortunately, 

                    this list will make it virtually impossible to get wildfire 

                    prevention resources to the communities where they are most 

                    needed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list, 

                    which was published in the federal registry earlier this month, 

                    is intended to provide a guide for where federal fire prevention 

                    efforts should be directed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It will 

                    be of little help, according to Oppenheimer. &quot;This list 

                    leaves agencies whistling in the dark,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many of 

                    the listed communities are in areas that face little, if any, 

                    threat from wildfires. Less than one-third of the communities 

                    on the list are in the Interior West, which has experienced 

                    the most severe wildfires in recent years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of 

                    the areas that were included on the list include: Delaware, 

                    Rhode Island, Maryland, Puerto Rico, New York, New Jersey, 

                    Massachusetts, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many 

                    of these areas have never seen severe wildfires and chances 

                    are they never will,&quot; said Oppenheimer. &quot;A catastrophic 

                    wildfire in Queens is about as likely as a hurricane in Montana.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not knowing 

                    which communities are most at risk could complicate implementation 

                    of the National Fire Plan, the multibillion funding package 

                    adopted by Congress in response to last year's record wildfire 

                    season. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The General 

                    Accounting Office recently testified to Congress that federal 

                    land management agencies have failed to adequately define 

                    the criteria by which threatened communities should be identified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

                    to the GAO, &quot;the National Fire Plan will become little 

                    more than a funding source&#133;and [will] not ensure that 

                    federally appropriated funds are being spent in those wildland-urban 

                    interface communities at the highest risk of wildland fire.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 

                    545 highest-risk communities identified by the Interior Department, 

                    278 are in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, where severe 

                    wildfires do not occur, reported the GAO.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By 

                    including low-risk communities, the government is jeopardizing 

                    communities in the West, where there are massive wildfire 

                    threats,&quot; Oppenheimer continued. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As thousands 

                    of acres burn across the western United States, the federal 

                    government is preparing to spend billions of dollars to protect 

                    areas that are not at risk to wildfire. A recent agreement 

                    between the Western Governors' Association and the Bush Administration 

                    could cost taxpayers $3 billion per year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Before 

                    taxpayers spend a nickel to reduce wildfire risks, the federal 

                    government must determine where the money is most needed,&quot; 

                    Oppenheimer concluded. &quot;If the government uses this list 

                    as a roadmap for where to reduce wildfire risk, taxpayers 

                    are going to get burned.&quot;</font></p>
