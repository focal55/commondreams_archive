- February 6 - California&#146;s plan to spend up to $10 billion to address

the state&#146;s electricity crisis will take the state down a path of debt that is almost

certain to lead to higher electricity bills, higher taxes or both, Public Citizen said

today.

<p>The plan, which was signed into law late last week, calls for the state to assume

utilities&#146; financial risks by spending up to $10 billion to buy electricity on their

behalf. It essentially uses public money to pad the profits of profiteering corporations

and relieves California's utilities of all market risk.</p>



<p>The state&#146;s better option is to buy tangible assets, such as power plants and

transmission lines, so California can regain control over sky-high prices and unreliable

supply. But the legislation forbids the state from using any taxpayer money to &quot;take

ownership of transmission, generation, or distribution assets.&quot; </p>



<p>&quot;This bailout is a recipe for taxpayer indebtedness for many years to come,&quot;

said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;It&#146;s a boon for the energy

industry and a crying shame for taxpayers. Without addressing the inflated wholesale

electricity market, the state's taxpayers will be buying a go-cart for the price of a

Porsche. The state ought to buy power plants and regain complete control over the

electricity market.&quot;</p>



<p>The plan will be a $10 billion-dollar bust because it will simply hand taxpayer money

over to a few out-of-state power plant owners. The state will receive nothing in return

but wildly overpriced wholesale electricity, Claybrook said. Under the bailout plan,

taxpayers &#151; not California&#146;s utilities &#151; will assume all the financial

risk, and the more than $10 billion in expenditures won&#146;t guarantee lower wholesale

prices.</p>



<p>The bill signed by Governor Davis, ABX1 1, immediately appropriates nearly $476 million

in cash from the general fund and up to $10 billion in revenue bonds over the next two

years to purchase wholesale<b> </b>electricity from the handful of corporations that own

power plants in and around California. California&#146;s utilities will be paid by the

state to handle billing and other services, but the state will bear all financial risk of

collecting outstanding consumer bills and purchasing wholesale<b> </b>electricity from

power plant owners. </p>



<p>The agreement does not require the utilities to sell electricity produced at their own

hydroelectric and nuclear facilities to the state at cost. Instead, the utilities can sell

their power at market prices and use the proceeds to pay off their &quot;debt.&quot; The

state will sell the power it purchases at cost to the state&#146;s consumers. Finally, the

legislation forbids the state from using any taxpayer money to &quot;take ownership of

transmission, generation, or distribution assets.&quot; </p>



<p><b>The Fallacy of Long-Term Contracts in an Overpriced Market</b></p>



<p>The state apparently believes that by purchasing electricity through negotiated

long-term contracts at between 5.5 cents and 7.0 cents a kilowatt hour, it will save more

money than continuing to rely upon the day- and hour-ahead spot market. </p>



<p>But even the low end of the state&#146;s offer is a grossly inflated price, way above

the cost of producing electricity (it is important to note that a week ago, the handful of

power producers rejected a state offer to buy electricity at similar rates). The nearly

$28 billion of electricity sold to California in 2000 was more than 276 percent higher

than in 1999. Binding taxpayer money to purchase wildly overpriced electricity for many

more years to come will only handcuff the state financially. </p>



<p>California need only look to the costly mistakes made through earlier over reliance on

long-term energy contracts as a way to drive prices down. Expensive long-term contracts

for renewable sources of energy were mandated by the federal government in 1986 and forced

upon utilities by state regulators. Those contracts helped make California&#146;s consumer

electricity rates among the highest in the nation &#151; something the 1996 deregulation

law was supposed to address. </p>

<p><b>Taxpayers Will Have Nothing to Show, While Corporations Stand to Profit Even More</b></p>



<p>For the same amount of money<b> </b>as it will spend in the bailout plan, California

could force the utilities and power producers to sell their assets to the state. By

temporarily taking control of electricity production until longer-term solutions are

found, California could guarantee lower prices because it would sell electricity to

households and businesses at cost.</p>



<p>But because the bailout legislation expressly forbids the state from acquiring such

assets, California&#146;s taxpayers will continue spending billions to pad the profits of

a handful of out-of-state power plant owners. The seven major out-of-state power producers

and power marketers posted $6.5 billion in after-tax profits in 2000. </p>



<p>&quot;These companies have the money to address this situation,&quot; Claybrook said.

&quot;Unfortunately, they&#146;d rather use taxpayer money to bail them out, and the

California legislature is setting consumers up to do just that.&quot;
