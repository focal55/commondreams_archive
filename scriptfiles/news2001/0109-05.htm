- January 9 - The following is a

statement by National Abortion Federation Executive Director Vicki

Saporta on nomination of John Ashcroft as US Attorney General:

<p>The National Abortion Federation is strongly opposed to the

confirmation of John Ashcroft for US Attorney General because of

our grave concern that he will not enforce the laws protecting

abortion providers and their patients. We fear an increase in the

levels of violence directed against the dedicated health care

professionals who provide safe, legal abortion services to women if

Ashcroft becomes the next Attorney General.

<p>We know firsthand how important the Justice Department is in

stemming the tide of violence against abortion providers. In

recent years, the Justice Department provided US Marshall

protection to abortion providers in the wake of extreme acts of

violence; placed two anti-choice terrorists on the FBI's Ten Most

Wanted list; participated in local law enforcement educational

programs on the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act;

and dispatched federal law enforcement officials to communities

where local law enforcement officials were not enforcing the law.

In the last two years since Janet Reno created the National Task

Force on Violence Against Reproductive Health Care Providers, NAF

has documented an overall decrease in extreme forms of anti-choice

violence. The actions of the Task Force have served as a deterrent

to violence and have saved lives.

<p>From our close to 25 years of collecting statistics on incidents

of violence and harassment against abortion providers, we know that

when laws are enforced, violence decreases. Conversely, when laws

are not enforced, violence in communities across the country

increases. We cannot tolerate another increase in violence because

an Attorney General refuses to vigorously enforce the law.

<p>Throughout his career, John Ashcroft has allowed his extreme

position on a woman's right to choose, which would outlaw abortion

even in cases of rape and incest, to influence almost every aspect

of the jobs he has performed, both in the state of Missouri and as

a US Senator. For a quarter century, he has consistently placed

the goal of banning abortion at the forefront of his legislative

agenda, and has even brought political retribution against those

who have opposed his extreme agenda.

<p>In Congress, he has successfully led the fights to defeat the

confirmations of those whose ideology he does not support. He has

stated, "Those who devalue life must not be placed in authority

over policies affecting our most vulnerable. I have repeatedly,

and in many instances alone, fought President Clinton's anti-life

nominations and appointments including activist federal judges and

Surgeon General nominees Henry Foster and David Satcher."

<p>During the time that Ashcroft served as a Senator, and a head of

the Republican Party in Missouri, a known anti-choice extremist,

Tim Dreste, was elected by Republican Party officials in Missouri

to the Missouri Republican State Central Committee, the

policy-making body of the party. That year, 1996, Dreste asked the

state GOP to add to its platform a murder penalty for abortion

providers. The state Republican Party also provided funds to

Dreste in his race for state representative. Dreste was finally

ousted from the state committee in 1999, after embarrassing the

committee by being one of the defendants who lost a federal lawsuit

in which the jury awarded $107 million in damages. Twelve

defendants, including Dreste, were found guilty of making illegal

threats. Dreste was cited for distributing "Wanted" posters of

abortion providers that threatened violence against them. Other

defendants in the case were tied to the Nuremberg Files website

which lists doctors' names, with lines through those who have been

killed by anti-choice extremists. Ashcroft only called on Dreste

to resign from the committee after being pressured to do so.

Additionally, Ashcroft's rhetoric on the subject of abortion

matches that of some of the most violent members of the anti-choice

movement.

<p>The dedicated women and men who risk their lives to provide safe

reproductive health care to women deserve nothing less than an

Attorney General who will vigorously enforce the laws of the land.

Our examination of John Ashcroft's record leads us to conclude that

his extreme ideology has rendered him unable to fulfill that

mission.

<p>We urge all Americans, regardless of their position on a woman's

right to choose, to oppose Ashcroft's confirmation as Attorney

General because his extremist views are out of touch with

mainstream America and would interfere with his vigorous

enforcement of the law.

<p><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional association

of abortion providers in the US and Canada dedicated to ensuring

that abortion remains safe, legal and accessible.
