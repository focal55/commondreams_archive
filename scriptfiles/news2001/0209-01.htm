- February 9 -  Campaign for America today released an analysis of IRS

financial disclosure reports demonstrating that current

regulations do little to keep non-federal soft money raised by

politicians for their personal PACs (leadership PACs) from

seeping into federal campaign activity.

<p>"Politicians are raising so-called non-federal money,

avoiding the scrutiny and restrictions imposed by federal

election law, and then, either through direct transfers or

through indirect subsidizing, using the money to support federal

campaign activity," says Cheryl Perrin, executive director of

Campaign for America, the only national advocacy group whose

sole mission is passage of campaign finance reform.

<p>According to FEC regulations, money raised for non-federal

purposes such as state and local election activity must be kept

separate. Federal leadership PACs, however, are allowed to

allocate non-federal funds for joint fundraising activities and

shared operating expenses provided the allocations are

disclosed. A law passed in August requiring leadership PACs to

disclose non-federal contributions and expenditures sheds new

light on how PACs use this minor provision or skirt the

provision entirely to subsidize federal election activity.

<p>"The information provided by the new disclosures strongly

suggests we need to strengthen the barrier between the federal

and non-federal accounts," Perrin says.

<p>The new IRS reports also demonstrate that leadership PACs

have become a significant source of political money for many

federally elected officials. Financial disclosure forms showed

that leadership PACs raised $5.86 million in soft money between

August and the end of 2000.

<p>According to the new filings, over half ($3,389,843) was

raised by the top five PACs: GOPAC, linked to Rep. David Dreier

(R-Calif.); Republican Majority Issues Campaign (RMIC), linked

to Tom Delay (R-Texas), the New Democrat Network (NDN) linked to

several Democrats; Keep Our Majority PAC (KOMPAC), headed by

Speaker Denny Hastert (R-Ill.); and Lone Star Fund, linked to

Rep. Martin Frost (D-Texas).

<p>While the Democrats achieved parity in raising soft money for

their party for the 2000 election cycle, Democratic leadership

PACs raised $2,390,389 in non-federal money, nearly $1.5 million

less than the $3,861,198 raised by their GOP counterparts.

However, Senate Democrats raised $1,723,576 compared to $269,050

in non-federal money raised by GOP Senate leadership PACs, while

GOP House members raised $2,902,635 compared to $666,813 in

non-federal money reported by House Democrat leadership PACs.

<p>House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier's GOPAC topped

the list, raising $944,110. GOP Whip Delay's RMIC raised

$689,513; Speaker Hastert's KOMPAC raised $669,000; the New

Democrat Network raised $645,920 and Democratic Whip Frost's

Lone Star Fund received $441,300. The figures reflect only

contributions raised from the time the law was enacted in July

through the end of the year.

<p>A searchable database of all 527 filers can be found on

Campaign for America's website, <a href="http://www.Campaignforamerica.org">Campaignforamerica.org</a>. Users

can search by name, state or zip code. The site also includes

a database of donors, both individuals and corporations.

non-profit non-partisan organization, was founded in 1995 to

advocate for the passage of meaningful campaign finance reform.
