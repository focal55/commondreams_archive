- July 16 - Earthjustice today filed 

the first of seven lawsuits challenging the federal government's 

chronic failure to protect Americans from the health hazards of toxic 

air pollution. The defendant is the very agency tasked with providing 

such protection: the Environmental Protection Agency. The plaintiff 

is Sierra Club. To compel EPA to do its job, Earthjustice will file 

one lawsuit each day for the next week. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All seven lawsuits address EPA's failure to establish controls for 

such highly toxic air pollutants as dioxins, PCBs, and mercury -- 

pollutants that even in tiny doses can cause devastating health 

effects. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's lawsuit challenges EPA's failure to promulgate regulations 

to control the emission of hazardous air pollutants from 

approximately 80 different industrial categories. The facilities in 

these categories are &quot;major&quot; polluters under the Clean Air Act, which 

means that each year each facility can emit more than ten tons of one 

hazardous air pollutant or more than 25 tons of any combination of 

hazardous air pollutants. The &quot;major&quot; polluter categories that EPA 

has failed to regulate run the gamut from steel plants to 

semiconductor plants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress gave EPA ten years to complete its regulation of major 

sources of hazardous air pollutants. One quarter of the regulations 

were due by 1994, one half by 1997, and the entire process was to be 

completed by 2000. EPA has missed all of the deadlines, including the 

last. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That EPA has missed a slew of Clean Air Act deadlines is 

symptomatic of its inadequate efforts to control hazardous air 

pollutants,&quot; said Earthjustice attorney James Pew. &quot;First, EPA 

consistently fails to meet its statutory deadlines for promulgating 

regulations to control hazardous air pollutants. Second, when the 

agency finally does issue the required regulations, they're far 

weaker than the law requires. Third, even those weak regulations 

aren't effectively enforced. EPA is not implementing the Clean Air 

Act's toxics provisions the way Congress intended, and that's a 

serious problem for public health.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most recent data from the National Air Toxics Assessment show 

that the vast majority of Americans are breathing hazardous air 

pollutants above levels considered safe by EPA. The Center For 

Disease Control has found unsafe levels of these pollutants present 

in human test participants. For example, CDC found that in 10 percent 

of the women tested, mercury is circulating at levels that are 

potentially unsafe for a developing fetus. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While EPA delays in controlling these toxic emissions,&quot; points 

out Dr. Bob Palzer, chair of Sierra Club's Air Committee, &quot;people are 

being exposed unnecessarily to extremely dangerous poisons. Many of 

the uncontrolled pollutants are a triple threat. Not only are they 

toxic in the air, but they also fall back to earth where they 

contaminate the environment for decades and poison our food and 

water.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of Sierra Club, Earthjustice filed suit in the United 

States District Court for the District of Columbia. For more 

information, contact Suzanne Carrier of Earthjustice (202-667-4500) 

or Bob Palzer, Ph.D. of Sierra Club (541-482-2492).
