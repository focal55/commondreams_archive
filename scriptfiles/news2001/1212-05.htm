<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 

- December 12 - In another sign of the growing influence of a nationwide listener movement demanding democratic change at the nation's oldest listener-sponsored broadcaster, the controversial No. 2

executive at the Pacifica Radio network resigned yesterday following

sustained protests.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Program Director Utrice Leid, who helped carry out last

December's &quot;Christmas Coup&quot; at Pacifica station WBAI 99.5 FM in New

York, resigned her post effective Tuesday after only two months on the

job, according to an internal Pacifica memo obtained by the Pacifica

Campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A former talk show host, Leid was installed as WBAI General Manager

last Christmas holiday weekend. Senior Pacifica executives and Leid

changed the locks in the middle of the night, installed security guards

and cameras, and then fired and banned some 25 producers and staff. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WBAI listeners, staff, and community groups slammed Pacifica's actions

as a blatant case of union-busting and decried the climate of hate,

race-baiting, and physical intimidation at the station.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This resignation is another important step in our campaign to restore

accountability to the Pacifica Radio network,&quot; said Juan Gonzalez, the

coordinator of the Pacifica Campaign, a nationwide listener pressure

group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But the injustices at and the destruction of WBAI cannot be swept

under the rug,&quot; he added. &quot;All the producers that were arbitrarily

fired and banned must return and a new democratic governing structure

must be put in place at WBAI and around the network.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resignation comes in the wake of an investigation into allegations

that Leid had assaulted award-winning journalist Amy Goodman, who hosts

the national daily news show &quot;Democracy Now!,&quot; and countenanced attacks

on WBAI morning news anchor Robert Knight and others. Leid ultimately

fired Knight and he remains banned from the station. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; staff left WBAI, saying it was an unsafe and

hostile workplace. In retaliation, Pacifica executives suspended the

&quot;Democracy Now!&quot; staff without pay and yanked the show from four of

five Pacifica stations. &quot;DemocracyNow!&quot; continues to broadcast on

almost 100 community radio and TV stations across the country. See

<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/" target="_new">http://www.democracynow.org/</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pacifica Radio executive leadership and national board claimed the

moves at WBAI were necessary to expand and broaden the station's

audience. But WBAI's Arbitron estimated audience has dropped an average

of 30 percent in recent months. In addition, on-air and off-air

fundraising collapsed, the station's signature voices were driven out,

and a nationwide boycott movement emerged to oust Pacifica's national

management. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica reformers say Leid was a hammer for corporate raiders on the

Pacifica Board who sought to eviscerate the station's hard-hitting

progressive programming and even sell WBAI's valuable license. WBAI is

positioned right in the heart of the FM dial in the world's most

competitive -- and lucrative -- media market. It's valued at anywhere

from $150-$250 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leid garnered national and international attention this past year when

she used WBAI's airwaves to slander critics and incite violence. She

sparked protests from Nobel Laureate Jose Ramos-Horta and others when

she claimed that Amy Goodman fabricated the 1991 massacre in East Timor

- a story for which Goodman won numerous awards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At one point, Leid banned discussion of 9-11 on WBAI's airwaves,

ordering music and poetry instead.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it was Leid's race-baiting and incitement to violence that

generated the largest storm of controversy. She openly called on her

&quot;stalwart soldiers&quot; to take up &quot;arms&quot; in a &quot;war&quot; against Pacifica's

critics. Even though nearly all of the staff fired at WBAI were

African-American, and New York's leading black journalists and trade

unionists rallied to their defense, Leid claimed that her critics were

engaged in a campaign of &quot;European psychological warfare against

Africans,&quot; presumably meaning her. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the outcry, the embattled majority on Pacifica's Board

continued to back her. But in recent months, a nationwide listener

movement has forced the resignation of all of the officers on the

Pacifica National Board, including the Pacifica Board chair,

vice-chair, treasurer, and secretary.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The network's entire top management has also been forced to step down,

including executive director Bessie Wash, national program director

Steve Yasko, and now Yasko's replacement, Utrice Leid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leid was presiding over a network whose national programming was

virtually gutted. Even the network's national news show, the Pacifica

Network News (PNN), had lost virtually all of its affiliate stations to

a progressive daily news show, Free Speech Radio News, produced by

striking PNN free-lance reporters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pacifica Campaign is an organization of staff and listeners alike

calling for democratic accountability at the 52-year-old network. The

campaign has called for the return of fired and banned staff who

possess the skills and experience necessary for the long-term success

of WBAI and the Pacifica Radio network.</font></p>
