<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> November 15 - Last Friday, Jonathan Prince, who owns the <a href="http://www.Gatt.org" target="_new">Gatt.org</a> domain, received a call from Verio, <a href="http://www.Gatt.org" target="_new">Gatt.org</a>'s upstream provider. The World Trade

Organization had just asked Verio to shut down the domain for

copyright violations, and Verio told Prince that it would do just that

if nothing was changed by November 13--the last day of the Doha

Ministerial, as it would happen. An official email followed

(<a href="http://rtmark.com/verio.html" target="_new">http://rtmark.com/verio.html</a>). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(Last-minute update: Verio's shutdown is currently expected sometime

after noon EST today--watch software sites above for updates.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's the war,&quot; says Prince. &quot;Bush has popularized zero-tolerance, and

it's open season on dissent of any kind. So just when they're meeting

in Doha, the WTO has decided to divert attention from its problems by

attacking a website.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Or maybe they really do want to make it so that protest has as little

place on the web as it does in Qatar,&quot; adds Prince.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oddly enough, the WTO has been aware of the parody website since

before the 1999 Ministerial in Seattle, when it issued a public

statement claiming the site misled visitors

(<a href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr151_e.htm" target="_new">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres99_e/pr151_e.htm</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two weeks ago, the WTO issued another release

(<a href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news01_e/gattdotorg_e.htm" target="_new">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news01_e/gattdotorg_e.htm</a>), this

one claiming that Gatt.org was harvesting e-mails, an allegation

reprinted as fact in some newspaper articles

(<a href="http://rtmark.com/pressgat.html" target="_new">http://rtmark.com/pressgat.html</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While it may be puzzling why the WTO chose to issue a second press

release about Gatt.org two years later, it is even more surprising

that they are now taking concrete steps to stop the critical site.  

In statements made just last week to the French daily newspaper

Liberation and to others, WTO spokesperson Jean-Guy Carrier stated

that &quot;It's not our job to use legal means against people. We

appreciate dissidence and honest criticism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why the sudden change of attitude?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;They got nervous, it's only human,&quot; said Elaine Peabody, a

spokesperson for The Yes Men (<a href="http://www.theyesmen.org" target="_new">http://www.theyesmen.org</a>), the group

that maintains the <a href="http://www.Gatt.org" target="_new">Gatt.org website</a>.  &quot;The WTO remembers what happened

the last time they had one of these meetings [in Seattle].  They felt

like tackling something they knew they could handle--and a satirical

website fit the bill.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BATTLE HEATS UP</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the WTO could well have stepped on a hornets' nest.  To counter

the attack, the Yes Men have are releasing today a piece of

open-source &quot;parodyware&quot; (<a href="http://theyesmen.org/yesiwill/" target="_new">http://theyesmen.org/yesiwill/</a>) that will&quot;forever make this kind of censorship obsolete,&quot; according to Peabody.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Using this software, it takes five minutes to set up a convincing,

personalized, evolving parody of the WTO.org website, or any other

website of your choice,&quot; said Peabody, who helped to develop the

program. &quot;All you need is a place to put it--say, WTOO.org,

WorldTradeOrg.com, whatever.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The software, called &quot;Yes I Will!&quot;, automatically duplicates websites

as needed, changing words and images as the user desires--with results

that can be very telling. The WTO site can be made to speak of&quot;consumers&quot; and &quot;companies&quot; rather than &quot;citizens&quot; and &quot;countries.&quot;

Unleashed on the CNN.com website, the software can simplify the

reporting even further by referring to Bush as &quot;Leader,&quot; and the war

in Afghanistan as one between &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;; a Time.com article

linked from the site then discusses &quot;The Poor Way of War&quot;. The parody

site updates itself automatically as the target website changes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The idea is to insure that even if they shut down our website,

hundreds of others will continue our work of translation,&quot; said

Peabody. &quot;The more they try to fight it, the funnier they're going to

look.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Such heavy-handed tactics work as poorly in cyberspace as they do on

the geopolitical stage,&quot; said Cooper Kharms, another Yes Man. &quot;At

least Gatt.org was transparent: you could tell what it was by reading

a line or two. These other sites may not be so obvious.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prince thinks the software, while interesting, is not a solution.&quot;With their attack on Gatt.org, an unelected, unaccountable

organization is running roughshod over the USA Bill of Rights,&quot; said

Prince. &quot;But every day they violate people's rights in the Third

World, or enable corporations to do so. This time it's just closer to

home.&quot;</font></p>
