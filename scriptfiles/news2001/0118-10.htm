- January 18 - Former Senator, and Attorney General nominee, John Ashcroft "has

misconstrued the law surrounding affirmative action programs

throughout his Senate career and continues to do so in his current

confirmation testimony," said Georgina Verdugo today after

reviewing Ashcroft's testimony before the Senate Judiciary

committee.

<p>"In both instances when affirmative action was mentioned during

the hearing, Mr. Ashcroft got it wrong. He has purposefully

mischaracterized the law."

<p>Senator Orrin Hatch asked Mr. Ashcroft, on Tuesday "what sort of

affirmative action programs (he) would support?" Senator Ashcroft

completely deflected answering the question and referred to

"Affirmative Access" in Texas, California and Florida.

<p>"Clearly Senator Ashcroft will not distinguish the very

important differences between the programs that have replaced

affirmative action in these three states, or how they came about.

And by no means are these programs or their outcomes an adequate

substitute for legal and constitutional affirmative action," said

Verdugo.

<p>"Access and action are two very different things. During the

Presidential debates Governor Bush refused to articulate exactly

what he meant by "affirmative access" and now, Senator Ashcroft is

trying to hide behind the same undefined term."

<p>During Bill Lann Lee's confirmation hearings, Senator Ashcroft

confusedly cited Adarand (Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515

US 200 (1995) as the most important case in civil rights. Senator

Ashcroft deliberately ignores a 23-year-old Supreme Court ruling

that pronounces affirmative action constitutional. Senator Ashcroft

challenged Bill Lee's understanding of the law by injecting the

idea that quotas were part of affirmative action, failing to

recognize that quotas have been illegal since the Supreme Court

ruled on Bakke (Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,

438 U.S. 265 (1978). Four years later Senator Ashcroft still

refuses to accept the state of the law as it has been for nearly a

quarter of a century.

<p>Senator Ashcroft has been a strong and vocal advocate against

affirmative action, and his statements have only reinforced the

public misunderstanding on this issue. Affirmative action gives

qualified women and minorities an opportunity to succeed.

Affirmative action means a fair chance for all Americans.

<p><i>Ms. Verdugo is the Executive Director of Americans For A Fair

Chance and has served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in

the Department of Justice, Office Legislative Affairs.
