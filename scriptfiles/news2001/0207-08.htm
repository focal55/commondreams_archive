- February 7 - Raising the limit on the amount of money individuals are

permitted to contribute to congressional and presidential candidates would make them

beholden primarily to the wealthy, according to <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/reform/hard$increase.html">a Public Citizen analysis</a>

of 1999-2000 campaign contributions.

<p>The analysis focuses on the impact of a proposal likely to be presented during this

year&#146;s 7congressional debate on the McCain-Feingold-Cochran campaign finance reform

bill, which would ban unlimited &quot;soft money&quot; contributions to political parties.

The proposal calls for the current &quot;hard money&quot; limit on individual

contributions to be raised from $1,000 to $3,000 per election.</p>



<p>In the 1999-2000 election cycle, nearly half -- 46 percent -- of individual

contributions to federal candidates came from donors who gave at least $1,000. If the

individual hard money limit were tripled, Public Citizen estimates this proportion would

have risen to 63 percent -- on the conservative assumption that half of the large donors

would have tripled their giving and half would have remained the same. The amount of hard

money received by all House, Senate and presidential candidates from $1,000+ donors would

have doubled from $391 million to $782 million.</p>



<p>&quot;Increasing this contribution limit is a terrible idea that would further corrupt

our already corrupted system,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;It

would send a strong signal to large contributors that the price of access and influence

has tripled, and they now must cough up more money to retain their status.&quot;</p>



<p>Because donors may contribute to both primaries and general elections, increasing the

contribution limit would allow one person to give $6,000 per election cycle and a couple

to give $12,000. Moreover, fundraisers could assemble &quot;bundles&quot; of $3,000-$6,000

checks from employees of a company or lobbying firm.</p>



<p>Proponents of increasing the limit argue it is needed because of the rising cost of

living and escalating campaign costs. But they are overlooking the fact that the limit was

designed to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, Claybrook said. Last

year, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a $1,075 contribution limit for statewide races in

Missouri on the grounds that state legislatures could determine that such limits were

reasonable to combat corruption. </p>



<p>Public Citizen&#146;s analysis also found that: </p>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li>Almost 232,000 people gave $1,000 or more to federal candidates in 1999-2000 &#151; just

      one-ninth of 1 percent of the voting-age population;</li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li>In 1999-2000, 47 percent of total individual contributions raised by Senate candidates

      came from donors who gave at least $1,000. If the contribution limit were raised to

      $3,000, the percentage would have risen to 64 percent -- on the conservative assumption

      that half of the large donors would have tripled their giving and half would have given

      the same;</li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li>In 1999-2000, 38 percent of total individual contributions raised by House candidates

      came from donors who gave at least $1,000. If the contribution limit were raised to

      $3,000, this percentage would have risen to 71 percent;</li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li>In 1999-2000, 55 percent of total individual contributions raised by all presidential

      candidates came from donors who gave at least $1,000. At a $3,000 limit this percentage

      would have risen to 71 percent; and </li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>



<blockquote>

  <ul>

    <li>The proposal to raise limits wouldn&#146;t clearly favor either of the two major

      political parties.</li>

  </ul>

</blockquote>



<p>While soft money (those unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy

individuals to political parties) is a huge problem in politics today, large hard money

contributions are also of great concern on such issues as taxes and Social Security

reform, the analysis noted. The current McCain-Feingold-Cochran bill banning soft money

would have banned an estimated $500 million in national party soft money received in the

1999-2000 election cycle. But if the hard money contribution limit had been increased, it

would have returned about $391 million of that, estimates show.</p>



<p>&quot;We cannot overstate how greatly lawmakers in Congress are swayed by any kind of

big money, whether it is hard or soft,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch. &quot;Tripling the hard money limit represents three steps

back in the effort to stop the legalized bribery that goes on in Washington today.

Boosting the contribution limit would undermine congressional reformers&#146; goal of

cleaning up the system.&quot;
