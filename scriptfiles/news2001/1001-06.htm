<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- October 1 - Participants of a Washington-based arms control alliance have condemned

the administration's attempts to circumvent current arms export controls by

proposing to waive restrictions on arms exports and military aid in its

draft &quot;Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001.&quot;  The current administration proposal is

to lift restrictions on arms sales to India and Pakistan, including those

prohibiting arms sales to countries with abhorrent human rights records,

countries testing or proliferating nuclear weapons, or a history of

supporting terrorism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Over twenty participants of the Arms Transfers Working Group (ATWG) &#150; an

alliance of over 30 arms control, peace, religious, and human rights

organizations &#150; sent a letter to Members of Congress on Friday, September

28, 2001, calling on them to oppose any language that gives the President

free rein to send arms and military aid abroad without regard for current

export criteria and other controls on the export decision-making process.

In particular, ATWG participants want to ensure that decisions to send arms

exports and military aid overseas give proper consideration of a country's

level of political stability, respect for human rights, civilian control of

the government, and record of cooperation against terrorism.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The administration's proposals, whether blanket waivers or limited to

specific states, could open the door to ill-considered arms transfers that

do more harm than good.  The ATWG letter notes, &quot;we are concerned that the

proposed language could undermine the core values of U.S. foreign policy &#150;

freedom, democracy, and respect for human life &#150; and ultimately jeopardize

American security.&quot; Ending congressional oversight on arms sales to

Pakistan and India is particularly worrisome given the risk of inflaming

the ongoing conflict between these nuclear nations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The administration's proposed arms control waivers may ultimately be

removed from  the Anti-Terrorism bill and added to a relevant

appropriations bill.  The President may also decide to invoke Section 614

of the Foreign Assistance Act, which gives him special authority to provide

up to $50 million per country per fiscal year in military or other aid for

national security reasons.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The letter is attached.  Other organizational letters delivered to

Congress are also available upon request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">September 28, 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Dear Member of Congress:	</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We are writing to express our concerns about language in the

Administration's proposed anti- terrorism legislation that would waive

restrictions on U.S. weapons exports and military assistance to countries

that may assist the U.S. in its fight against terrorism.  As

representatives of religious, development, arms control and human rights

organizations working to limit the negative impact of the weapons trade on

international peace and security, we are concerned that the proposed

language could undermine the core values of U.S. foreign policy - freedom,

democracy, and respect for human life - and ultimately jeopardize American

security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, we believe that Congress should continue to oversee U.S. arms

exports and military assistance while not sacrificing the following central

foreign policy goals:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;	Long-term Regional Stability - the United States should not export

weapons and provide military assistance that could destabilize countries

and regions;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;	Respect for Human Rights - the United States should not supply weapons

and military aid to governments that would use them to violate the human

rights of or deny basic freedoms to their citizens;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;	Civilian Rule - the United States should not provide weapons or military

aid to those countries whose duly elected head of government is deposed by

decree or military coup;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;	State Sponsors of Terrorism - the United States should not provide

weapons or aid to countries that sponsor terrorism;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149;	Arms Trade Boomerang - the U.S. should not provide weapons or military

assistance to foreign parties if there is a reasonable possibility that

they could be used against U.S. personnel or U.S. interests in the future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current U.S. law already includes emergency provisions that permit the

President to provide military equipment and aid to allies in times of

crisis.  Before exercising such national security waivers, we urge Congress

and the President to consider the broader foreign policy goals articulated

above and to take steps to ensure that any waiver be limited in both scope

and duration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Existing restrictions on U.S. weapons exports and military aid have been

carefully crafted over the last fifty years to protect U.S. national

security and prevent the misuse or diversion of U.S. military assistance or

equipment.  The tragic events of September 11 demonstrate that the U.S.

must take steps to protect the country and bring to justice those

responsible for the terrorist attacks. But in an effort to overcome the

threat of terrorism, the U.S. should not reverse laws and policies that

have served to keep weapons out of the hands of governments and terrorists

who may threaten U.S. national security.</font></p>
