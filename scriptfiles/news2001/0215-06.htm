- February 15 - The Congressional Progressive Caucus today hailed last night&#146;s announcement that the AFL-CIO formally endorsed the framework of its &#147;American People&#146;s Dividend&#148; plan, by which every man, woman and child receives a set dividend tax cut, as long as a surplus exists. The Caucus, which this week authored a letter to labor leaders urging them to support the dividend concept, is now aggressively moving forward to have its tax plan become the prime alternative to the Bush plan, which gives most tax relief to the wealthy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive Caucus Chairman Dennis Kucinich said, &#147;Representing 13 million people and the aspirations of many more, the AFLCIO has given a significant endorsement to the Progressive Caucus' plan for equitable distribution of the surplus.  Members of Congress should be encouraged to ensure that all people get an equal share of the surplus through an American People's Dividend.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three weeks ago, Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-VT) brought the dividend plan to the Caucus, which promptly endorsed the proposal. The next day, Members of the Progressive Caucus presented their &#147;American People&#146;s Dividend&#148; to the Democratic Caucus as a whole, and with a supportive response, was called into a private meeting with Minority Leader Gephardt to discuss the possibility of the plan becoming the prime alternative to the Bush plan. Members of the Progressive Caucus are now negotiating with Members of the Ways and Means Committee to have its plan formally adopted as the prime alternative to the Bush plan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive Caucus Vice Chair Barbara Lee (D-CA) said, &#147;&quot;I am thrilled that the AFL-CIO has endorsed the concept behind the Progressive Caucus&#146;s American People&#146;s Dividend plan. Clearly, this is the plan that will give the most tax relief to the greatest number of Americans, including children, minorities, seniors, and the poor. I look forward to working with my colleagues, the AFL-CIO, and other groups that will benefit from the Progressive Caucus tax plan to make sure that those left out of the &#145;economic boom&#146; of the past eight years will see some real tax relief.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Progressive Caucus released a report entitled &#147;Equalizing Tax Reform&#148; in which it presented detailed analysis comparing the American People&#146;s Dividend to the Bush plan. All told, the report proved that the plan to give every man, woman and child in America $300 would provide far more tax relief to 80% of the population than the Bush plan, at half the cost to the government. Additionally, the report also analyzed how the American People&#146;s Dividend would provide far more immediate stimulus to the economy than the Bush plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &#147;While the Bush proposal essentially leaves out seniors and low-income workers, the Progressive Caucus plan helps everyone - and I am glad that the AFL-CIO and labor leaders see that. Our premise is based on the fact that Americans rich and poor helped build the surplus, and therefore everyone should get an equal part of that surplus - not just the wealthy. This plan is simple, across-the-board, and fiscally prudent. President Bush should stop trying to trick the American people into believing that his plan helps everyone, and join the Progressive Caucus and the working people of America to pass a plan that gives everyone an equal benefit.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Kucinich was elected chairman of the Progressive Caucus one month ago.  With the development and promotion of the American People&#146;s Dividend, and with positions on several other issues under development, the Progressive Caucus is showing new life as a force in Congress.</font></p>
