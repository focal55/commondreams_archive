- July 10 - On Wednesday (July 11), an array of groups will be protesting the policies of ExxonMobil. Many are calling for a boycott of the oil giant. The following activists and policy

analysts are available for interviews:

<P><LI>CHRIS DORAN, <A HREF="mailto:chrisdoran@pressurepoint.org">

Doran is campaigns director for PressurePoint, an organization launching its first major campaign directed at ExxonMobil on Wednesday. Doran said today: "ExxonMobil might

be the richest corporation in the world, but morally it is bankrupt. The U.S.

government's climate change policy is the ExxonMobil policy. What sort of

democracy do we have when one company can buy off our political process for its

own gains? We're turning up the heat on ExxonMobil and George W. Bush to take real

action on climate change and corporate influence."

<P><LI>CARWIL JAMES, <A HREF="mailto:carwil@moles.org">

carwil@moles.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.moles.org">www.moles.org</A><BR>

Oil Campaign coordinator for Project Underground, James said today: "ExxonMobil often

leads the charge in the oil industry's effort to lower environmental

protections and to open new ecosystems and homelands to oil drilling, and leads

in breaking even those lowered environmental standards. In 1997, CEO Lee

Raymond blatantly warned developing countries to lower environmental standards

or risk losing foreign investment. From the half-million people affected by a

1998 Mobil oil spill in Nigeria to the billion dollars Mobil gave Russian and

Kazakh partners for transactions with no apparent business purpose in 1999, the

company consistently fails to be accountable to the communities its destructive

operations affect."

Author of <I>The Heat Is On: The Climate Crisis, The Cover-Up, The Prescription</I>,Gelbspan

said today: "ExxonMobil's funding of the most vocal 'greenhouse skeptics'

goes far beyond normal public relations spin, given the robust nature of the

science and the unavoidable evidence of what is happening to the climate."

<P><LI>STEVE KRETZMANN, <A HREF="mailto:kretzmann@mindspring.com">

kretzmann@mindspring.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.seen.org">www.seen.org</A><BR>

Policy analyst with the Sustainable Energy and Economy Network, Kretzmann said today: "Whether you're talking about global warming or human rights violations, ExxonMobil is

at the top of the list of offenders. There has just been a suit filed against

it for collaboration in ongoing human rights violations, including murders, in

Indonesia. It is cooperating with the repressive regime in Chad. ExxonMobil

should suspend operations in these areas immediately."

<P><LI>ALEX TAPIA, <A HREF="mailto:alex@campaignexxonmobil.org">

alex@campaignexxonmobil.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org">

Tapia is climate coordinator for Campaign ExxonMobil, a coalition of environmental and religious shareholders in ExxonMobil. He said today: "There will be over 100 protest

actions tomorrow. The company should take responsibility for its role in global

warming and invest in renewable energy."
