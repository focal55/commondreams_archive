<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY?: Conferees urge against waging indiscriminate wars of revenge in 

Afghanistan and challenge the Congress and President to use the full forces 

of the federal government to meet today's true security needs.  Priority 

number one for the nation, according to the women, is effective security 

measures such as terrorist detection and fully funding programs such as the 

Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs, designed to keep nuclear 

weapons and materials from falling into terrorist hands. Activists and 

legislators are alarmed that total funding for every facet of the nation's 

anti-terrorist efforts from law enforcement to stockpiles of vaccinations 

received only $8.4 billion in 2000, while Congress is poised to spend $8.3 

billion this year on a narrow, unproven missile defense program.  WiLL/WAND 

is the only national peace organization linking women legislators, local 

activists and women in Congress in order to address issues of militarism, 

violence and human needs. For more information, log onto &lt;<a href="http://www.wand.org" target="_new">www.wand.org</a>&gt;.</font></p>
