- May 8 - In response to news reports

that President Bush may announce his first judicial nominations

within days, the National Women's Law Center urged the Senate to

carry out its equal and independent constitutional responsibility

in the confirmation process, by closely scrutinizing all nominees

to ensure their commitment to the rights and principles that

Americans hold dear.

<p>"Federal judges have sweeping powers to ensure that women

continue to advance or to turn the clock back," said Marcia D.

Greenberger, NWLC co-president. "In the judicial confirmation

proceedings to come, the burden will be on each nominee to

demonstrate to the Senate that he or she is worthy of a lifetime

appointment to the federal bench, with all the powers that role

carries. With fundamental rights at stake, the Senate must resolve

any doubts about a judicial nominee in favor of protecting those

rights."

<p>Before a judicial nominee is confirmed, the Senate must satisfy

itself not only that the nominee meets high standards of character,

experience, legal excellence and temperament, but also that he or

she embraces:

<p>-- a commitment to core constitutional principles that protect

and advance women's legal rights, especially rights guaranteed

under the Equal Protection Clause and the right to privacy, and

<p>-- a commitment to equal justice principles reflected in key

statutory provisions that protect and advance women's legal rights,

such as rights to education and employment secured by federal law.

<p>While much attention has focused on a possible Supreme Court

appointment in the coming months, nominations for the lower courts

are also critically important. Because most cases do not reach the

Supreme Court, those appointed to judgeships in the lower federal

courts will determine the fate of American women -- and men -- for

decades to come.

<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-profit organization

that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect women's

legal rights. NWLC focuses on major policy areas of importance to

women and their families including economic security, education,

employment and health, with special attention given to the concerns

of low-income women.</i>
