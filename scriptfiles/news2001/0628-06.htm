- June 28 - The Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Million Mom March announced today that the organizations would merge on October 1. Leaders of both groups heralded the alliance as a &quot;win-win&quot; opportunity for two strong groups that share the common goals of educating the public about gun violence and mobilizing support for sensible gun laws.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sarah Brady, Chair, and Michael Barnes, President, of the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center, together with Donna Dees-Thomases, Chair, and Mary Leigh Blek, President, of the Million Mom March, revealed the merger at a news conference in Washington, D.C. They were joined by a host of MMM members from throughout the East Coast. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This alliance sends a clear message that the gun control movement is uniting and targeted,&quot; said Sarah Brady. &quot;For many years, we have been successful in passing effective legislation, while increasing public awareness of the scourge of gun violence. Today's announcement is an exciting next step in further raising an army of supporters that will enable us to continue to effect change in Congress and in state Legislatures.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Donna Dees-Thomases said: &quot;Nearly 30,000 people die in the United States each year from gun injuries - almost twice the number of drunk driving deaths. By combining our experience, talent and resources, we are better positioned to secure national policies that adequately address the epidemic of gun trauma in this country.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Million Mom March (MMM) will be known as the &quot;Million Mom March, United with the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center.&quot; MMM chapters will continue to exist, with autonomous decision-making capability, under the guiding principles of the Brady Campaign and Center (formerly known as Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence). A primary goal of the merger is to foster the strong grassroots culture of the MMM while providing assistance from the national level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A total of three seats will be added to the Board of Trustees for the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to accommodate a voice for the MMM. Two of the seats will be on the <br>

Brady Campaign and the Brady Center, respectively. A third seat will go to a leader of the MMM, elected each year for a rotating term.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Million Mom March, started by mothers and survivors of gun violence, has grown into an impressive national grassroots movement - with 230 chapters across the country - and a household name in less than two years,&quot; said Michael Barnes. &quot;It is no secret that there is strength in numbers, and the combined membership of our organizations is sure to be a powerful force for common-sense gun legislation. Poll after poll, including one we released earlier this month, has shown that Americans want these measures. This alliance will help make that happen.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 14, the Brady Campaign released a national poll conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation International showing that Americans overwhelmingly support responsible gun control measures, including 83 percent who support closing the &quot;gun show loophole&quot; by requiring criminal background checks on all gun purchases at such shows. In addition, 84 percent of the respondents believe in requiring that all guns be sold with childproof safety locks, and 73 percent believe that a law should be passed that would prevent individuals from buying more than one handgun a month.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This legislative agenda is shard by the Brady Campaign and the Million Mom March. &quot;This alliance demonstrates our philosophy that cooperation is critical to reducing gun violence in America,&quot; said Mary Leigh Blek. &quot;We have always worked closely with the Brady Campaign and other groups. Today's announcement will only strengthen this partnership. Our goal is to unite, play to our strengths, and advance our shared mission of safer American homes, schools, and communities.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The merger will be effective on October 1. Additional details on implementation and structure will be available closer to that time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brady Campaign and Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence: For more than 25 years, the Brady Campaign has been the nation's largest national, non-partisan organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence with hundreds of thousands of dedicated members across the country. The Brady Campaign works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws, regulations and public policies through grassroots activism, electing pro-gun control public officials and increasing public awareness of gun violence. The Brady Center works to reform the gun industry and educate the public about gun violence, and works to enact and enforce sensible regulations to reduce gun violence including regulations governing the gun industry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Million Mom March: Founded in 1999, the MMM is a national grassroots, chapter-based (230 chapters in formation across the country) organization dedicated to preventing gun death and injury and supporting victims and survivors of gun violence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

The Million Mom March focuses on education and advocacy through grassroots activity across the country, seeking responsible limits on gun access and use. On Mother's Day 2000, more than 750,000 people marched on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. and tens of thousands of others marched in towns across America, to demonstrate their support for sensible gun laws. </font></p>
