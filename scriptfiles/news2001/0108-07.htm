- January 8 - Shutting out consumer groups from discussions about

California&#146;s energy crisis is a huge mistake, and the Clinton administration should

reverse itself and include the groups in upcoming discussions, a Public Citizen

representative said today.

<p>Consumer representatives typically have been excluded from meetings about the crisis

that have been held by the state of California, and now they are being shut out by the

White House. On Tuesday, representatives of utility companies are scheduled to meet with

the administration in a closed-door summit, where company executives will have exclusive

access to federal and state decision-makers, according to <i>The Washington Post</i>. The

administration has failed to invite anyone representing California's consumers, the <i>Post</i>

reported.</p>



<p>&quot;It is shameful that the Clinton administration thinks California's electricity

deregulation failure can be solved without input from consumer groups,&quot; said Wenonah

Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy &amp; Environment Program.

&quot;California got into this mess by writing deregulation's rules on terms dictated by

the power companies. It is time for regulators to listen to consumers and pull the plug on

deregulation.&quot;</p>



<p>Hauter noted that a recent <i>Los Angeles Times</i> poll showed that 66 percent of

Californians think deregulation was a mistake and favor re-regulation by a 2-to-1 margin.</p>



<p>&quot;Just because Californians never asked for deregulation doesn't mean regulators

shouldn't consult consumers on how to fix it,&quot; Hauter said.
