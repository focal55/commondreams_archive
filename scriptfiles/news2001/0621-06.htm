- June 21 - -- President Bush has moved 

to block insurance coverage for contraceptives for federal 

employees even as a new National Abortion and Reproductive Rights 

Action League (NARAL) poll released today shows Americans 

overwhelmingly support access to contraceptives and legislation 

requiring insurance companies to cover them. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On this issue, President Bush is in the minority of even his 

own party. He is supported by just thirteen percent of Americans. 

His position is outside the mainstream of American values,&quot; said 

NARAL President Kate Michelman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL's poll reveals that: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 87 percent of Americans support access to birth control, with 

69 percent saying they &quot;strongly&quot; support access. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 77 percent said they support laws requiring insurance 

companies to cover prescription contraceptives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite these numbers, President Bush's FY02 budget proposes 

deleting an existing provision requiring Federal Employee Health 

Benefits (FEHB) plans to cover prescription contraceptives if they 

cover other prescription drugs and devices. The Office of 

Personnel Management has stated that the contraceptive coverage 

requirement, originally passed in 1998, has not imposed any 

additional costs on the FEHB program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While most health plans cover prescription drugs, many exclude 

contraceptives. Forty-nine percent (49 percent) of all typical 

large group plans do not cover any contraceptive methods and only 

15 percent cover all five of the most commonly used reversible 

prescription methods. This inequity leads to higher out-of-pocket 

health care costs for women. Indeed, women pay 68 percent more for 

their health care than men, with reproductive health services 

accounting for much of the difference. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American public wants this inequity addressed. They want 

the health care system to work in ways that help women prevent 

unintended pregnancy and thus reduce the need for abortion,&quot; 

continued Michelman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NARAL has launched an aggressive nationwide campaign to address 

contraceptive insurance inequities:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

-- At the federal level, NARAL will work with members of 

Congress to secure contraceptive insurance coverage for federal 

employees and pass EPICC, the Equity in Prescription Contraceptive 

Coverage Act. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

-- Eleven NARAL affiliates are involved in contraceptive equity 

legislative campaigns at the state level (Mass., Mo., Mont., N.M., 

N.Y., Ore., Pa., Texas, Utah, Wash., Wis.). Republican Texas 

Governor Rick Perry recently signed that state's bill and 

Missouri's bill awaits Democratic Governor Bob Holden's signature. 

Nine other states are also considering contraceptive equity 

legislation (Ark., Ariz., Fla., Ill., Ind., La., Neb., Okla., 

S.C.).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

-- NARAL will send out over 600 contraceptive equity action kits 

to legislators in states that have not passed legislation. In 

addition, NARAL has sent out an alert to over 100,000 Choice Action 

Network members asking them to contact their members of Congress, 

state legislators, and their own employers to ask them to back 

contraceptive equity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans overwhelmingly support access to contraception. They 

want to see that insurance companies treat women fairly by 

providing coverage for contraceptives. The President and

anti-choice lawmakers do not. Their anti-choice, 

anti-contraception position is extreme and out of step with the 

American public,&quot; added Michelman. </font></p>
