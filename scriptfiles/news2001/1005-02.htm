<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - October 5 - Today the House Republican leadership broke ranks with the Bush 

Administration to lead the way on approval of the Farm Security Act 

of 2001. The House ignored the Administration's call for a common 

sense farm policy and extended programs that have hurt both 

taxpayers and the small family farm. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current farm policy includes price supports, loan programs, and 

marketing loans to certain commodities that cost federal taxpayers 

billions every year. These same payments keep the farm economy 

depressed and continue the vicious cycle of overproduction and low 

commodity prices. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This legislation would also continue to subsidize corporate 

agribusiness over small family farms at taxpayer expense. It sends 

the lion's share of farm payments to those who do not need 

government support. &quot;Nearly half of all recent government payments 

have gone to the largest eight percent of farms,&quot; according 

to the Bush Administration's Statement of Administration Policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Put simply, agribusinesses and large corporate farmers -- the 

least likely group of producers in need of federal assistance -- 

are among the largest recipients of these subsidies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Farm Security Act as passed by the House would cost 

taxpayers $170 billion over ten years, and would involve an 

increase in spending of over $73 billion. In recent years farm 

subsidies have often been supplemented by emergency payments to 

farmers for both unforeseen natural disasters and market losses. If 

unforeseen events occur that would require additional emergency 

spending, the $170 billion price tag would increase dramatically. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spending $170 billion dollar over the next ten years warrants a 

more in depth examination than the House afforded the issue. 

Unfortunately, taxpayers and farmers will once again be forced to 

pay the price for lawmakers' haste. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House today decided to build on the mistakes of the past. 

With new financial commitments arising from the September 11 

tragedy, it is now more critically important than ever that major 

spending decisions be carefully scrutinized. </font></p>

the American taxpayer. TCS is dedicated to cutting wasteful 

spending and subsidies in order to achieve a responsible and 

efficient government that lives within its means. </i>
