- October 18 - More people worldwide are now displaced by natural disasters than by 

        conflict. In the 1990s, natural catastrophes like hurricanes, floods, 

        and fires affected more than two billion people and caused in excess of 

        $608 billion in economic losses worldwide-a loss greater than during the 

        previous four decades combined. But more and more of the devastation wrought 

        by such natural disasters is &quot;unnatural&quot; in origin, caused by 

        ecologically destructive practices and an increasing number of people 

        living in harm's way, finds a new study by the Worldwatch Institute, a 

        Washington D.C.-based environmental research organization.

<p> &quot;By degrading forests, engineering rivers, filling in wetlands, 

        and destabilizing the climate, we are unraveling the strands of a complex 

        ecological safety net,&quot; said Senior Researcher and author of Unnatural 

        Disasters Janet Abramovitz. &quot;We have altered so many natural systems 

        so dramatically, their ability to protect us from disturbances is greatly 

        diminished.&quot; </p>

      <p>Also contributing to the rising toll of disasters is the enormous expansion 

        of the human population and the built environment, which put more people 

        and more economic activities in harm's way. One in three people-some 2 

        billion-now live within 100 kilometers of a coastline. Thirteen of the 

        world's 19 megacities (with over 10 million inhabitants) are in coastal 

        zones. The projected effects of global warming, such as more extreme weather 

        events and sea level rise, will only magnify potential losses.</p>

      <p> Although &quot;unnatural disasters&quot; occur everywhere, their impact falls 

        disproportionately on poor people as they are more likely to be living 

        in vulnerable areas and they have fewer resources to prepare for or recover 

        from disasters. Between 1985 and 1999, 96 percent of recorded disaster 

        fatalities were in developing countries. </p>

      <p>

        The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that future 

        impacts of climate extremes will affect the poor disproportionately. Viet 

        Nam and Bangladesh, for example, are projected to lose more than 70,000 

        square kilometers of land, affecting some 32 million people. Rich countries 

        will not be spared either. The entire Mediterranean coast is especially 

        vulnerable to sea level rise, as are the U.S.'s Atlantic and Gulf coasts.</p>

      <p>

        Economic losses from &quot;unnatural disasters&quot; are greater in the 

        developed world-the earthquake that rocked Kobe, Japan in 1995, for example, 

        cost more than $100 billion, making it the most expensive natural disaster 

        in history. Smaller losses often hit poor countries harder, where they 

        represent a larger share of the national economy. The damage from 1998's 

        Hurricane Mitch in Central America was $8.5 billion-higher than the combined 

        gross domestic product of Honduras and Nicaragua, the two nations hardest 

        hit.</p>

      <p>

        Few of the losses in poor countries are insured. In the period 1985-99, 

        the vast majority of insured losses-some 92 percent-were in industrial 

        nations.</p>

      <p>

        &quot;Expanding the financial safety net for poor countries is essential,&quot; 

        said Abramovitz. &quot;So too is maintaining and restoring nature's ecological 

        safety net in all countries. Dunes, barrier islands, mangrove forests 

        and coastal wetlands are natural 'shock absorbers' that protect against 

        coastal storms. Forests, floodplains, and wetlands, are 'sponges' that 

        absorb floodwaters. Nature provides these services for free, and we should 

        take advantage of them rather than undermining them.&quot; </p>

      <p>

        For example, China now recognizes that forests are ten times more valuable 

        for flood control and water supply than they are for timber, and has halted 

        logging in the Yangtze River watershed. The loss of 85 percent of the 

        forests in the upper Yangtze River worsened the 1998 flood that affected 

        223 million people. Viet Nam has restored 2,000 hectares of mangroves 

        in a successful effort to provide a buffer from coastal storms as well 

        as much needed jobs in fisheries. The U.S. could prevent a repeat of the 

        devastating 1993 Mississippi flood by restoring just half of the wetlands 

        lost in the upper Mississippi Basin-a move that would affect no more than 

        three percent of surrounding agricultural, forest, and urban land. </p>

      <p>

        To date, much of the response to disasters has focused on improving weather 

        predictions before the events and providing humanitarian relief afterwards-both 

        of which have saved countless lives. &quot;Yet, too often long-term mitigation 

        efforts are overlooked by the public and politicians alike,&quot; says 

        Abramovitz. &quot;Money invested in disaster mitigation yields several 

        fold returns in recovery cost savings. Considering the social and ecological 

        losses that are also prevented, it's clear that mitigation is a great 

        investment.&quot;</p>

      

<p>

        Unnatural Disasters also suggests several other specific mitigative measures: 

        Community-based disaster preparedness is essential in preventing and responding 

        to the full array of disasters that societies now face. Rather than subsidizing 

        environmentally unsound settlement and development practices, governments 

        need to direct new construction and settlement out of harm's way. Infrastructure 

        in vulnerable locations can be built or reinforced to withstand hazards. 

        Debt relief for developing nations can free up resources for desperately 

        needed disaster prevention efforts. Better hazard mapping can further 

        improve early warning and disaster preparedness schemes, keeping human 

        and economic losses as low as possible. </p>
