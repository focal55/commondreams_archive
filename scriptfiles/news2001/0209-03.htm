- February 9 - Anticipating Republican plans to rush legislation to

overhaul the bankruptcy code (S. 220) to the Senate floor next week, U.S.

Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) today wrote Majority Leader  Trent Lott to press

for numerous amendments to be allowed on both sides when the bill does come up

for consideration, and to insist on his rights as a Senator to full and open

debate.  Over the past two years, Wellstone has sucessfully led Senate

opposition to the bill, written largely by the credit card industry, which seeks

to shred the safety net protections offered to working families by bankruptcy

laws. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am troubled by reports that you intend to move the bill through the Senate

without substantive modifications.  In light of the dramatic shortcomings of

this legislation, I believe the Senate must allow time for numerous amendments

on both sides when this bill does come up for consideration.  It may even be

appropriate to debate the illogic of your haste in scheduling this measure. 

Naturally, I would view with great concern efforts to move this harsh bill

through expedited means on the Senate floor and will insist my rights to full

and open debate,&quot; Wellstone said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fundamentally, S. 220 is ill-conceived and unjust.  It imposes harsh penalties

on families who file for bankruptcy in good faith as a last resort, and it

addresses a &quot;crisis&quot; that appears to be self correcting.  It rewards the

predatory and reckless lending by banks and credit card companies which fed the

crisis in the first place, and it does nothing to actually prevent bankruptcy by

promoting economic security in working families.  As a result, a broad coalition

of consumer groups, unions, women's and children's groups, civil rights

organizations, and religious groups have united in opposition to this

legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I continue to be puzzled by the false urgency for this bill.  As bankruptcy

rates fell steadily in the past two years, the rhetoric about the &quot;crisis&quot; in

filings became even more shrill.  But even more perversely, projected increases

in bankruptcy filings for the coming year &#150; as a result of layoffs and falling

income due to a cooling economy &#150; is now being used to justify rolling back the

bankruptcy safety net.  In other words, now that more working Americans will be

forced to file for bankruptcy because of circumstances beyond their control, we

should make it harder for them to do so.  I for one will have difficulty making

that argument to the newly unemployed steelworkers in my state,&quot; wrote

Wellstone.
