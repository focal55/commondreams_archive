- February 20 - Reports from the British media

have confirmed the extent of election engineering and

voter disenfranchisement in Florida in 2000, resulting

in the victory of George W. Bush in the presidential

campaign.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investigations by BBC&#146;s Newsnight and The Guardian

(reported on Saturday, February 17) exposed how errors

and manipulation by DatabaseTechnologies (DBT)

eliminated thousands of voters from the Florida rolls,

especially African Americans whose votes would have

gone to Al Gore.  The Guardian article is excerpted

below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party has insisted that errors and

manipulation aren&#146;t the only assaults on voting

rights, but that voting rules in some states --

regardless of miscounts, erroneous elimination of

votes, and other failures and corruption of the system

-- are designed to swing elections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens continue to demand that states like Florida

abolish disenfranchisement of convicted felons,

especially those who have served their sentences. 

These policies exist for the very purpose of blocking

the votes of African Americans, other people of color,

immigrants, and the poor, all of whom are

disproportionately incarcerated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats as well as Republicans are responsible for

enacting and maintaining these rules.  More people

were imprisoned under Bill Clinton than under the

Reagan and Bush Sr. administrations combined.  Al Gore

was conspicuously silent about voter

disenfranchisement in the wake of the Florida debacle.

 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bipartisan support for the War on Drugs ensures that

thousands of Americans get convicted every year on

felony charges for minor, nonviolent offenses and lose

their voting rights.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">De facto obstruction of voting rights has replaced the

de jure obstruction prevalent in many states before

the civil rights movement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party, like other third parties, faced and

fought engineered election policies throughout 2000,

especially prohibitive ballot access laws designed to

hinder third parties, and the barring of Green

candidate Ralph Nader from the national debates, which

are strictly controlled by a commission owned and run

by the Democratic and Republican Parties.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of Greens helped organize and joined the

Inauguration Day protests on January 21.  A lawsuit

undertaken by Mr. Nader against the Commission on

Presidential Debates is now pending in a Boston court.</font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&gt;From The Guardian:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Information supplied by... DatabaseTechnologies

(DBT), led to tens of thousands of Floridians being

removed from the electoral roll on the grounds that

they had felonies on their records.  However, a

Guardian investigation in December confirmed by

Newsnight found that the list was riddled with

mistakes that led to thousands of voters - a

disproportionate number of them black - being wrongly

disenfranchised....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover the Florida state government, where Mr Bush's

brother Jeb is governor, did nothing to correct the

errors, and may have encouraged them.  Under DBT's

contract, seen by Newsnight, the company was obliged

to check its data by 'manual verification using

telephone calls and statistical sampling'. DBT was

paid $4.3m for its purge of the voters' roll, but

company officials confirmed that they did not call

voters they had included on their list to check if

they had identified the right person.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Lee, a vice-president of ChoicePoint, which

bought DBT last May, said: 'Florida law prevents names

from being removed from the voting roll unless the

information is confirmed by local officials - not us.'

 But he told Newsnight that the Florida state

government made it clear that it 'wanted there to be

more names than were actually verified as being a

convicted felon'.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blacks make up about 15% of the overall Florida

population, but half the state's prison population, so

the errors tended to erase their names

disproportionately from the electoral roll. State

officials have denied it was their responsibility to

check the felons list, arguing that it was the duty of

the individual counties.  A few counties found it was

so full of mistakes that they dumped the list

altogether. Some sent out warning letters to the

people who had been stripped of their voting rights,

putting the burden on them to appeal. But most simply

accepted the flawed list, and removed thousands of

names from the rolls.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The civil rights commission was due to question

ChoicePoint executives yesterday about their role. One

commissioner, Christopher Edley, said: 'There is a lot

of public concern that the contractor who was selected

to do this is a firm that seems to have ties to the

Republican party'....</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DBT was hired, in part, to comb through computerised

records around the country to identify former felons

registered to vote in Florida. After wrongly

identifying 8,000 Florida voters with Texas

misdemeanour records as felons, it supplied a revised

list of 57,770 'possible  felons' to Florida's

secretary of state, Katherine Harris.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list was full of mistakes mainly because of the

criteria DBT used. It compared its list of felons with

the Florida voting rolls by looking for a rough match

between the names and dates of birth. Thus, a

Christine Smith could have been disqualified if there

had been a Christopher Smith of the same age with a

felony record somewhere in the US. DBT also used race

as a matching criterion, skewing the impact of 

the errors even more against black voters, of whom

nine in ten 10 voted for Mr Gore&quot;....</font></p>
