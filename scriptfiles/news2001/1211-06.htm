- December 11 - I find it hard to believe Microsoft's contention that the handful of communications disclosed in their recent Tunney Act filing represents all of their attempts to influence the outcome of their antitrust case. Leaving aside more than a half a million dollars in corporate political contributions this year, they spend $5 million a year on lobbying. It's hard to imagine that none of that money was intended to influence a case filed by the government that challenges Microsoft's business practices, its intellectual property and its existence. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their filing suggests that settlement talks did not begin until September of this year, which is at best a very narrow reading. It is further difficult to believe that the few contacts Microsoft has disclosed represents the &quot;true and complete&quot; disclosure that the Tunney Act requires. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The whole point of these disclosures is for judges to have confidence that any proposed settlement is made in the public interest, and has not been influenced by politics. As any member of Congress can tell you, Microsoft has become an active player in lobbying and contributing to candidates since the Justice Department began looking at potential anti-trust violations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Their contributions are a legal attempt to grease the skids for the settlement that is on the table today, and are at least disclosed. Their filing defies belief. </font></p>
