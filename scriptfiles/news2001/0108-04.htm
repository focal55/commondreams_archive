- January 8 - President-elect George W. Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft for Attorney General is an affront to women and people of color who rely on the federal government to promote fairness and equal opportunity.  

<p>

John Ashcroft is an extremist who has consistently opposed measures to promote civil rights and women's rights in this country.  His opposition to hate crimes legislation, minority judicial appointees, and a woman's right to choose - even in cases of rape and incest - are shameful.  The role Ashcroft played last year in convincing his fellow Senators to reject a federal judicial appointment for Ronnie White, the first African American Supreme Court Justice in Missouri, was appalling. 

<p>

We call on Congress to reject his nomination, and to demand an Attorney General who will work to preserve, not restrict, the rights and opportunities of women and people of color.  John Ashcroft must not be confirmed.
