- June 15 - Wednesday, the Bush administration notified Congress of the sale of 10

advanced F-16 fighter jets and two KC-135 mid-air refueling tankers to the

government of Chile. The notification represents the practical end to a ban

on sophisticated weaponry to Latin America  since the Carter

administration.  It's official, the Bush administration has opened the

store, and all South American countries with the cash are invited to The

Arms Bazaar of the Americas!</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon's news release makes several false claims.  What follows are

excerpts from the release and our rebuttal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national

security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a

friendly country . . .&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the sale will work against the foreign policy and national

security aims of the United States, by decreasing Chile's security.  While

Chile may have more sophisticated weaponry in its arsenal, the F-16 buy

will spur other countries in the region to purchase similar weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;. . . which has been and will continue to be an important force for

political stability and economic progress in South America.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chile's political and economic development will not be helped in any way by

the $714 million purchase of F-16s.  Rather, resources devoted to military

modernization will reduce funding for pressing needs identified by the

heads of state at the most recent Summit of the Americas - &quot;access to

education, poverty alleviation, strengthening human rights and democracy

and economic integration.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not affect the basic

military balance in the region.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This sale will fundamentally alter the basic military balance in the

region.  No other country in the region can defend against Chile's proposed

F-16s, which have advanced, power projection capability.  Chile's neighbors

will be forced to match Santiago's purchase of jets that can strike deep

and accurately into their territory. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States' first priority should be to contribute to the political,

social and economic development of the countries in South America.  This

sale does exactly the opposite, reinforcing a militaristic approach to U.S.

foreign policy in a region where it is not needed, and is potentially

dangerous.  </font></p>
