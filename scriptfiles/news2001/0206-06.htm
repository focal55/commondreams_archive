- February 6 - The reproductive rights and health of American women are being

threatened by a handful of legislators who want their personal

ideology to replace the judgment of doctors and scientists.

<p>American women and their health care providers had been asking

for mifepristone for years because of the clear benefits it offers

as a health care option. The FDA approved the early option pill

because extensive clinical trials and use in other countries proved

beyond doubt that the drug is very safe and very effective. The

decision was based on science, plain and simple.

<p>But some members of Congress don't like science that contradicts

their ideology. They don't like medicine when it gives women more

options instead of taking options away. And when they don't like

something, they think their role as legislators gives them the

right to interfere with the work scientists, doctors, other health

care providers, and anyone else trying to use their knowledge and

expertise to serve the people of this society.

<p>Today, they are seeking to restrict access to mifepristone.

Tomorrow, it will be all forms of abortion. The day after that,

contraception, family planning services, medically accurate sex

education, and who knows what else. Enough is enough. It's time

to let the scientists, the healers, the professional health care

providers do their jobs, and let the legislators stick to theirs.

<p>

<i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the world's

largest and most trusted voluntary family planning organization. It

comprises 127 affiliates that operate 875 health centers

nationwide, which serve nearly five million Americans annually.
