- May 22 - The Human Rights Campaign today denounced two anti-gay measures that would deny funding to school districts which &#147;discriminate&#148; against the Boy Scouts for barring membership to gays and lesbians. The measures are unnecessary, however, because the law already dictates that the Boy Scouts have equal access to school facilities, says HRC. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., introduced the Senate measure and Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., introduced a companion measure in the House, where a vote is expected as early as May 23. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;These bankrupt measures will accomplish nothing concrete or substantial in the policy arena and are vivid examples of political grandstanding by anti-gay politicians,&#148; said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. &#147;The Boy Scouts have always had, and still have, access to schools. So this is really nothing more than a punishment in search of a problem.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To gain support for his amendment, Hilleary issued a letter to his colleagues on Capitol Hill that mistakenly said schools routinely deny access to the scouting organization. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reps. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., and Connie Morella, R-Md., sent a letter to lawmakers to address the error. &#147;The Hilleary 'dear colleague' [letter] might lead you to believe that such exclusion is lawful and commonplace, and it is not,&#148; they wrote. &#147;A selective denial of equal access is unlawful. And no school district has ever successfully barred the Boy Scouts from using school facilities that are open to all.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To rally support against the measures, HRC called on its members in an action alert to urge their representatives to oppose the measures. In addition, HRC, several key education organizations and others sent a letter of opposition to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the organizations who signed the letter are: the Association of School Administrators, American Association of University Women, American Psychological Association, Americans for Democratic Action, Anti-Defamation League, Council of the Great City Schools, HRC, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Myra Sadker Advocates, the National Association of School Psychologists, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Council of Jewish Women, National Education Association, National Federation of Filipino American Associations, National PTA, National Rural Education Association, National School Boards Association, National Women&#146;s Law Center, New York State Education Department, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, People For the American Way, Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Helms said on the Senate floor last week that &#147;radical militants&#148; were trying to ban the Boy Scouts from campuses. He also said they [gay activists] &#147;demand that everybody else&#146;s principles must be cast aside in order to protect the right of homosexual conduct.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community. </i></font></p>
