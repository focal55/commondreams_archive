- June 9 - The planned July 14 test of missile defense systems from Vandenberg AFB,

California will cost over $100 million and dramatically help to destabilize

global disarmament efforts.  Testing of the National Missile Defense (NMD

program is just the beginning of aerospace corporation, U.S. government and

Pentagon efforts to move the arms race into space.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent &quot;Rumsfeld Commission&quot; report states that, &quot;In the coming period

the U.S. will conduct operations to, from, in and through space in support

of its national interests both on the earth and in space.&quot;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;George W. Bush and his aerospace corporation allies know that they cannot

go to the American people and ask for hundreds of billions of dollars for

offensive space weapons that will allow the U.S. to control and dominate

space,&quot; says Regina Hagen, a German  board member of the Global Network

Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power in Space.  &quot;So instead they dress up their

new Star Wars plan in sheep clothing and call it a defensive shield to

protect the U.S., and now its allies, from purportedly 'rogue' states.  In

Germany, we can see through this fa&ccedil;ade.&quot;</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the merits of  NMD are debated, the Bush administration is moving to

deploy Theatre Missile Defense (TMD) systems in the Middle East.  It will

also eventually surround China, and will force a chain reaction of nuclear

weapons proliferation as Iran, China, India, and Pakistan all move to

respond to U.S. destabilizing deployments.  First comes NMD, then TMD, then

space-based lasers.   In the end the world becomes more unstable, the

weapons corporations get rich, and the American taxpayer gets hung out to

dry,&quot; claimed  Bruce Gagnon, Coordinator of the Global Network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coming on the heels of Bush's enormous tax cut, an expansion of the arms

race into space will also force Congress to abandon any real effort to

provide health care for those Americans who do not presently have it, and

will require dramatic cuts in other needed social programs.  Despite claims

otherwise Congress cannot provide both guns and butter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The farewell warning to the American people by President Dwight Eisenhower

in 1961 to &quot;beware of the power of the military industrial complex&quot; seems

all the more relevant today as the aerospace industry now has &quot;unwarranted&quot;

access and influence in Congress and the White House.  Democracy is in

danger when such decisions are made to spend the national treasury on plans

that will only lead to a more unstable world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Global Network is organizing an International Day of Protest to Stop the

Militarization of Space on October 13.  Local actions will be held at

military bases and aerospace corporations  facilities around the world.
