- June 25 - Today the U.S. Supreme 

Court handed a major defeat to the National Rifle Association (NRA) 

in the organization's ongoing attack on the federal Brady Law. The 

Supreme Court declined to hear the NRA's appeal of a decision by 

the federal court of appeals in the District of Columbia which 

upheld the legality of a Justice Department regulation implementing 

the Brady Law's National Instant Criminal Background Check System 

(NICS) for firearm purchases. The regulation gives the Federal 

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the ability to combat abuse of the 

system by conducting periodic security audits of electronic records 

in NICS. Such audits ensure that NICS is not being defrauded in 

ways that allow felons, fugitives, and other prohibited persons to 

obtain firearms. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Supreme Court's action makes it clear that the NICS audit 

log is legal. And while the Ashcroft Justice Department defended 

the audit log in court, the Attorney General is now working to 

undermine the system through the regulatory process,&quot; said Mathew 

Nosanchuk, VPC litigation director and legislative counsel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 4, 2001, the VPC sued Ashcroft in federal district court 

in Washington, DC for illegally suspending the final Justice 

Department regulation implementing a 90-day retention period for 

information on approved firearms transfers in the NICS audit log. 

The regulation that Ashcroft suspended is an updated version of the 

one that the Supreme Court declined to review today. The VPC today 

filed an amended complaint adding two individual plaintiffs who 

have been injured by Ashcroft's unlawful delay of the NICS 

regulation. Tomorrow, the VPC will file a motion asking the court 

to decide the legal issues in the case in its favor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In suspending the regulation, Ashcroft cited the need for 

further &quot;study&quot; of the regulation due to privacy concerns. 

However, Ashcroft's own lawyers opposed the NRA's court petition, 

arguing that the &quot;Attorney General's audit log regulations-which 

require both temporary retention of certain information for a brief 

period and the information's complete destruction after that 

period-are consistent with the Brady Act.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adds Nosanchuk, &quot;Ashcroft's Justice Department is speaking out 

of both sides of its mouth-defending the legitimacy of the audit 

log in the Supreme Court, while at the same time undermining it by 

suspending the final NICS rule that would make the 90-day retention 

period permanent.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Violence Policy Center is represented in its suit by 

Virginia A. Seitz from the Washington, DC office of Sidley, Austin, 

Brown &amp; Wood. Last month the VPC launched 

<a href="http://www.ashcroftgunwatch.org" target="new">www.ashcroftgunwatch.org</a>, the leading source of ongoing information 

on Ashcroft, his pro-gun activities and gun lobby ties, as well as 

his enforcement of current gun laws. </font></p>
