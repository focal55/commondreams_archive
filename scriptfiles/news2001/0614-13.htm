- June 14 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force today joined a coalition of groups (below) opposing George W. Bush's nomination of Wade Horn. Horn has been nominated to be Assistant Secretary for Family Support, the top family policy position in the Department of Health and Human Services. Horn's reactionary views are out of touch with the changing demographics of families in the United States and pose a particular threat to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender families. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the head of the National Fatherhood Initiative, Horn has aggressively advocated denying access to federal programs to families not headed up by a married man and a woman. These programs include Head Start, public housing, financial aid for education expenditures, job training and others. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Horn has written, &quot;If we are serious about encouraging marriage, and by extension, fatherhood, we should make these limited-supply benefits available first to married, two-parent families.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;More than half of the children growing up today will spend some of their childhood in a single-parent family - whether because of choice, divorce, separation, death or - in the case of many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender couples - because they cannot legally marry,&quot; said NGLTF Executive Director Lorri L. Jean. &quot;George W. Bush campaigned on a theme of 'Leave No Child Behind.' If the U.S. Senate confirms Horn's nomination, we might as well change that slogan to, 'Leave No Child Behind As Long As Their Parents Are Happily Married Heterosexuals.'&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 1990 Census, one in five lesbian couples had children living with them, as did five percent of gay male couples. And new statistics that are just now being released by the U.S. Census Bureau show a dramatic rise in the number of reported same-sex, unmarried partner households. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the context in which Horn's nomination poses a threat to GLBT families,&quot; Jean said. &quot;The nuclear, mother-father-child family that Horn would give preferential treatment to now represents fewer than one in four U.S. families.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a detailed analysis prepared by the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund Horn also: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Opposes abortion, opposes no-fault divorce and views the National Organization for Women as a &quot;radical feminist organization.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Believes the Southern Baptist Convention statement &quot;that a wife should 'submit' to her husband's servant leadership&quot; and &quot;serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation.&quot; He quotes from the New Testament that &quot;the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Believes that mothers want fathers to participate in caregiving as subordinates, not as equals. &quot;By this, I don't meant to imply that mothers do not want their husbands to be involved dads,&quot; Horn once wrote. &quot;They do. &quot;But they want that involvement to be on their terms, with themselves as the 'field generals' and the fathers as 'enlisted men.'&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Horn was also involved in the &quot;parental rights&quot; movement of the early- to mid-1990s that sought to make it more difficult for the government to investigate child-abuse cases and easier for parents to prevent not only their children but other parent&#146;s children from being exposed to sexuality education and life-saving information on HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. That movement failed, largely due to opposition from teachers, progressive clergy and social services advocates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGLTF this week sent a letter to members of the Democrat-led Senate Finance Committee asking committee members to oppose the Horn nomination. Text below. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*********************************** </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The text of the letter delivered to the members of the Senate Finance Committee: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 14, 2001 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator_______: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing to urge your opposition to the nomination of Wade Horn as Assistant Secretary for Family Support at the Department of Health and Human Services. We ask that you investigate the writings and philosophy of Mr. Horn and that you question him thoroughly when he comes before the Senate Finance Committee for confirmation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The HHS Assistant Secretary for Family Support, the country&#146;s top family policy post, will be making important decisions and recommendations on many critical public programs which serve predominantly lower income children and families, including welfare, childcare, child welfare, child support, adoption, foster care, child abuse and domestic violence. The person who holds this job will also influence the Administration&#146;s positions and activities dealing with next year&#146;s reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) programs. This person must be able to understand and promote the needs of ALL families in our society. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wade Horn wants the government to promote marriage by penalizing families where the parents divorce, separate, or do not marry. He also wants the government to tell unmarried mothers to surrender their children for adoption. There is very little &quot;support&quot; for families in these sentiments. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With Wade Horn as Assistant Secretary for Family Support, we fear a Department of Health and Human Services that will penalize, and promote discrimination against, families headed by a divorced, separated, or never-married parent or where both parents live in the home but are not married. Horn has written that single parent families should be denied public benefits whose supply is limited -- such as public housing, Head Start, and child care -- unless all married couples have been served first. Horn has written that cohabiting parent families should be denied any welfare benefits at all, and kept at the end of the waiting list for other benefit programs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to divorce, separation, death, abandonment or their parent&#146;s never-married status, more than half the children growing up today will spend some of their childhood in a single-parent family. An increasing number of children live in two parent families where the parents delay marriage, choose not to marry or are prevented by law from marrying. Horn advocates penalizing all these children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By supporting Wade Horn&#146;s nomination as Assistant Secretary for Family Support at the Department of Health and Human Services, President Bush&#146;s campaign call to &quot;Leave No Child Behind&quot; rings hollow. If the President&#146;s true intention is to support all of America&#146;s families and children, rather than judging and penalizing many, he should appoint an individual who can work with Congress, our states and our own dedicated organizations to ensure that we will be more &#150; not less -compassionate when dealing with our children and families living at or near poverty. </font></p>
