- February 27 - A bill introduced today to authorize new base closures 

                      could save taxpayers more than $20 billion over the next 

                      15 years, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS), 

                      a national budget watchdog organization.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

                      bill, which was introduced by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) 

                      and Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) would authorize two new rounds 

                      of base closes in 2003 and 2005. That would save billions 

                      for other important defense priorities, says the group. 

                      </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This 

                      common sense legislation is good for taxpayers and for the 

                      Pentagon,&#148; said Alise Frye, Director of the TCS National 

                      Security Project . &#147;This important piece of legislation 

                      is key ingredient for our national security priorities for 

                      the twenty-first century. Base closure is a vital next step 

                      in right-sizing the U.S. military.&#148; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Base 

                      Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, allows for the creation 

                      of a commission to review military bases for the possibility 

                      of closure. In order to maintain impartiality, the commission 

                      creates a list of bases to be closed that is then sent to 

                      Congress for a yes or no vote without amendments.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, 

                      the armed services must pay about $3.6 billion a year for 

                      excess bases. By 2003, this cost will have grown to more 

                      than $25 billion. The United States could save a projected 

                      $21 billion dollars through 2015 if the military is allowed 

                      to close its unneeded bases in 2003 and 2005.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While 

                      savings may not be seen immediately from the closure of 

                      unneeded bases, base closure is important to meeting our 

                      national security needs. Dollars spent on maintaining those 

                      facilities are dollars not spent on modernizing equipment 

                      or improving the quality of life for men and women in uniform.,&#148; 

                      continued Frye. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 

                      recent report by Business Executives for National Security 

                      found that 70% of the Department of Defense budget is spent 

                      on support functions, including bases. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said 

                      Frye, &#147;It would be comparable to seven of every 10 

                      fireman just doing paperwork - leaving only three left to 

                      fight fires.&#148;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 

                      base closures are initially difficult for communities, research 

                      has shown that previously closed military bases across the 

                      country are now generating income and providing jobs at 

                      equal or higher rates than the military base provided. Base 

                      property returned to communities has been turned into schools, 

                      community centers and municipal airports. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies 

                      by the RAND Corporation, the Congressional Research Service 

                      and the National Bureau of Economic Research have found 

                      that in the long run, localities with closed bases are better 

                      off.</font></p>

<p align="left">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The 

                      military has been asking Congress for six years to allow 

                      another round of base closures. It is time for Congress 

                      to do the right thing for taxpayers and for America&#146;s 

                      soldiers, sailors and airmen,&#148; concluded Frye. </font></p>
