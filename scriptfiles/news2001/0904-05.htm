- September 4 - Earthjustice's White

House Watch reported today that the U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency's Region V office will release its preliminary draft

report on the investigation of Ohio's enforcement of federal

environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act. The U.S. EPA's

investigation has been the object of heightened public interest

because it reflects upon the qualifications of the Bush

administration's controversial nominee -- Donald Schregardus

-- to head EPA's national enforcement program. The draft report

will be released to the public later today, but a letter accompanying

the draft was released to the public late last Friday. According

to the letter, Ohio must take steps to avoid withdrawal of authority

to administer Clean Air Act programs in the state.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This program review appears to be a wake-up call for Ohio EPA

and bad news for Don Schregardus's bid to be EPA's top enforcement

cop," said Maria Weidner of Earthjustice's White House Watch

program. "EPA's letter threatens withdrawal of Ohio's clean air

programs unless changes are made. As part of its consideration of

whether Mr. Schregardus is fit to head EPA's enforcement program,

the U.S. Senate should carefully examine this report as well as the

public comments on the draft that will be submitted during the

30-day review period."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schregardus's tenure as director of Ohio EPA (and that of his

successor) has been the subject of this federal investigation by

EPA known as the Ohio Program Review. The review was initiated

after petitions from several Ohio environmental groups submitted

information to U.S. EPA documenting the failure of Ohio EPA under

Schregardus to enforce federal environmental standards.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"EPA's letter indicates that the review is not a good report

card for Don Schregardus," explained Weidner. "We are concerned

that the Bush administration has been trying to sugar-coat the

findings of the Ohio Program Review in order to help Schregardus's

chances of being confirmed by the Senate, but apparently Ohio's

failure to adequately enforce the Clean Air Act was too blatant to

overlook."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Donald Schregardus's nomination for Assistant Administrator of

EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance has drawn fire

from national, regional, and Ohio environmental groups, as

well as from several U.S. Senators. Concerns have been fueled not

only by the EPA's investigation of Ohio's enforcement of federal

environmental programs, but also due to several other troubling

aspects of Schregardus's track record as director of Ohio EPA,

including:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Schregardus's opposition to every federal initiative to clean

up the nation's dirtiest power plants while at Ohio EPA and his

role in the agency's decision to disregard a federal mandate that

called for the reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions from

utilities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A ruling by a U.S. administrative law judge that found

Schregardus and other Ohio EPA officials guilty of violating the

whistleblower provisions of seven federal environmental statutes

and of misrepresenting possible threats to human health at

contaminated sites in Marion, Ohio.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- During Schregardus' tenure at Ohio EPA, legal actions brought

by the agency to force polluters to clean up contaminated sites

fell by more than 50 percent.
