<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOSTON 

- February 27 -</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;I feel 

              that there should be reform of the estate tax in order to further 

              protect small business and small farms, but repeal would be throwing 

              the baby out with the bath water. The fact of the matter is that 

              this tax is paid by the top 2 percent of the wealthy people in this 

              country. And so this is a really important way to tax accumulated 

              wealth and provide more opportunity.&quot;</i></font>

              2/15/01</font></p>

            

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over 400 more 

              people personally affected by the estate tax have signed on to Responsible 

              Wealth's &quot;Call to Preserve the Estate Tax,&quot; launched two 

              weeks ago by William H. Gates, Sr., and 120 other wealthy people.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hundreds of 

              the new signers fall in the $700,000 to $5 million range of family 

              wealth. Critics of the statement have implied that only billionaires 

              and centimillionaires, who can easily afford taxes, support preserving 

              the tax. But in fact, most of the signers have small fortunes and 

              think it&#146;s fair that they be taxed on a portion of their wealth. 

              The statement calls for reforms of the current policy, such as raising 

              the exemption level and strengthening the protections for family 

              farms and businesses, instead of repeal.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I was 

              able to build a successful software company thanks to the support 

              of public schools, public scholarships, public research grants, 

              and public contracts. The last thing I want to do is pull up the 

              ladder behind me so that others can&#146;t get those same kinds 

              of support to succeed,&quot; said Syracuse entrepreneur Martin Rothenberg.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush&#146;s 

              Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said yesterday, &quot;[The President] 

              is aware of this effort launched by several millionaires and billionaires 

              to keep the estate tax in place. He disagrees.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chuck Collins, 

              co-director of United for a Fair Economy, responded, &quot;President 

              Bush should not dismiss this as the concern of a small number of 

              ultra-rich people. Opposition to estate tax repeal is widespread 

              among &#145;the millionaires next door&#146; and people at every 

              income bracket who care more about charitable giving, adequate public 

              services, and the dangers of growing concentrated wealth than about 

              tax cuts for the already wealthy. We are calling for an open debate 

              on tax cut priorities.&quot; Mr. Collins is available for interviews 

              after the President&#146;s speech tonight.</font></p>
