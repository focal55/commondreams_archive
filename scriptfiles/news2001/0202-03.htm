- February 2 - Citing a new poll showing

that Americans want their government to lead the way in reducing

world hunger, Bread for the World president David Beckmann today

called on Congress and the Bush administration to take up that

challenge.

<p>"The United States and other industrial nations have the

resources and the know-how to cut world hunger in half by the year

2015," Beckmann said. "We have lacked only the political will. In

this poll Americans say they want to end hunger and are more than

willing to pay their share."

<p>The new poll, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and conducted

by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy

Attitudes (PIPA), found that Americans overwhelmingly favor using

U.S. foreign aid to ease hunger and spur economic development in

the world's poorest countries. This is one of the first

comprehensive studies of American attitudes toward foreign aid

since 1995, when PIPA last conducted a similar survey. The study

included a nationwide poll of 901 randomly selected Americans as

well as focus groups and a review of polling by other

organizations.

<p>In its 1995 poll, PIPA found that 64 percent of the public

wanted to cut foreign aid, while the new poll shows this number has

fallen to 40 percent. The new study also clearly illustrates that

Americans would overwhelmingly support a global effort to reduce

hunger worldwide, specifically in Africa. Eighty-three percent of

the public said that the United States should be willing to commit

to a joint plan for cutting world hunger in half by the year 2015,

and 70 percent of respondents rejected the notion that, "The U.S.

has no vital interest in Africa."

<p>Beckmann predicted the poll would boost Bread for the World's

Africa: Hunger to Harvest campaign, in which thousands of church

members and others will urge Congress to make a long-term

commitment to help reduce hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, the world's

poorest region.

<p>"Many members of Congress mistakenly believe that Americans are

overwhelmingly against foreign aid and don't care about hungry and

poor people overseas," said Beckmann, a Lutheran pastor. "This

poll shows us that is not true."

<p>Bread for the World will propose that Congress begin by

approving an additional $1 billion a year in effective,

poverty-focused aid to Africa. That aid would include the next

installment of U.S. funds for international debt relief, $240

million for fiscal year 2002.

<p>"The total annual cost of this $1 billion package would be a

penny a day per American," Beckmann said. "With our country

expecting budget surpluses totaling $3.2 trillion over the next

decade, we surely can afford this investment in a healthier, more

secure world."

<p>Of those polled, 87 percent favored giving food and medical

assistance to countries in need. Seventy-three percent favored

U.S. aid to help poor countries develop their economies. And 75

percent said they would be willing to pay $50 a year in taxes to

cut world hunger in half.

<p>Africa: Hunger to Harvest is Bread for the World's principal

lobbying campaign for 2001. "We want the United States to focus on

Africa because that is where hunger is most widespread and

persistent," Beckmann said. "If we want to cut hunger in half

worldwide by 2015, our greatest challenge is in Africa."

<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where hunger has more than

doubled over the last 30 years. One of every three people there is

chronically undernourished and 291 million people (as many as the

entire U.S. population) live on less than $1 a day.

<p>Africa's efforts to overcome poverty have been thwarted by civil

wars, the HIV/AIDS pandemic (which kills 6,000 people a day),

burdensome foreign debt, declining farm production, environmental

problems and other hardships. But recently there have been signs

of renewal, including new democratic governments, the rise of

grassroots organizations, and economic progress.

<p>With additional aid, African countries could begin to make

investments to work themselves out of poverty. These might include

enrolling more children in school (especially girls, who are often

kept out), improving farm production and food distribution,

treating and preventing HIV/AIDS and other diseases, encouraging

business investment, building roads, and fostering small

businesses.

<p>During the last Congress, Bread for the World was a key part of

the Jubilee 2000 coalition that persuaded a once-reluctant Congress

to approve debt relief for poor countries. BFW members generated

approximately 250,000 letters to Congress in support of debt

relief. The organization also was instrumental in securing U.S.

food stamp program reforms to help about a million low-income

households.

<p><i>Bread for the World is a 45,000 member Christian citizens'

movement against hunger. Founded in 1974, Bread for the World's

members lobby Congress and the administration to bring about public

policy changes that address the root causes of hunger and poverty

in the United States and overseas. Bread for the World is a

nonpartisan organization supported by 45 denominations and many

theological perspectives. Please visit our Web site at
