- June 25 - In comments submitted to the U.S. Dept. of Energy&#146;s Fast Flux Test Facility Review today, Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy &amp; Environment Program urged the department to follow the original Record of Decision, which specified permanent deactivation of the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) &#150; the most contaminated nuclear site in the western world.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Janury 19, 2001 then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson signed a Record of Decision that stated &quot;the Fast Flux Test Facility in Washington will be permanently deactivated.&quot; On April 25, 2001, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham suspended that Record of Decision for 90 days. During the suspension a review of the decision to permanently shut down FFTF is being conducted. Comments are due by July 3rd.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The comments provided by Public Citizen outline six reasons against the re-start of the FFTF, and for the original Record of Decision to permanently shut it down. These include:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no genuine need for the facility to operate. Stated purposes of a restarted FFTF could be achieved at other extant facilities. <br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food irradiation is a dangerous, controversial technology, and the form that requires sealed sources of isotopes (that FFTF could create) is not being favored by food industries. Food irradiation should not be used as justification for restarting FFTF. <br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Fast breeder&quot; reactors, such as FFTF, are unstable and dangerous, and have experienced at least two meltdowns in the US. Further, it is an internationally rejected technology. <br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reopening the FFTF would only worsen the radioactive waste problems at the Hanford site. <br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Restarting the FFTF would be a wholesale waste of taxpayer money. <br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opening the facility to create more sealed sources of radiation runs counter to the EPA's program to locate and collect dangerous &quot;orphaned&quot; radiation sources. <br>

<br>

</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Elaborating on the food irradiation aspect, Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy &amp; Environment Program, said, &quot;Claims by the DOE that we need to produce radioactive material to irradiate food are absolutely false.&quot; Technology currently exists that does not require sealed sources of radioactive isotopes. Public Citizen stands against any form of food irradiation, however. &quot;Using irradiation to make our food supply safe is like using a chainsaw to cut butter - it's excessive and unnecessary. Cleaning up filthy factory farming and slaughtering practices will provide American families with safe, wholesome food.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FFTF was built at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington in 1980, and began running in 1982 to serve as a fuel and material irradiation test facility, but was closed in 1992. It was considered unprofitable to keep open solely for research purposes, and commercially viable uses for it could not be identified. Decommissioning the plant would cost about $70 million, while restarting it would cost more than $284 million with an additional $100 million per year to operate at full power.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The DOE is creating a new taxpayer boondoggle,&quot; Hauter said. &quot;Instead of concentrating on cleaning up the environmental nightmare at Hanford, it is trying to restart the reactor to create more radioactive material. It is nothing but a welfare program for the nuclear establishment, and the US and international experience with this type of reactor argues against restarting it.&quot; </font></p>
