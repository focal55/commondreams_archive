<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 7 - News Advisory: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, Sept. 10, National Women's Law Center Co-President 

Marcia D. Greenberger will testify in support of the Equity in 

Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act (EPICC) 

before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and 

Pensions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenberger's testimony is expected to focus on the importance 

of contraceptive coverage for women's health and equality. She 

will discuss the recent federal court decision in Erickson v. 

Bartell Drug Co. and a December 2000 ruling by the Equal Employment 

Opportunity Commission that represent significant progress on this 

issue, and why EPICC is still needed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenberger will also highlight the Center's efforts through its 

Pill4Us Campaign to encourage women to ask their employers to add 

coverage of prescription contraceptives to their health plans. The 

Center has already worked on behalf of several female employees to 

encourage employers to cover this health care need. The Center Web 

site is giving employees the tools and information they need to 

approach employers about contraceptive coverage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When: <br>

Monday, Sept. 10 at 3 p.m. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where: <br>

Dirksen Senate Office Building, Room 430 <br>

First and Constitution Ave, N.E. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-profit organization
