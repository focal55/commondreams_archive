<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><blockquote>



Award-winning filmmakers Kelly Anderson and Tami Gold <EM>(Out at Work, Another Brother)</EM> team up with Academy Award-winning executive producer Infact for the world festival premiere of the film that’s got Philip Morris scared. <EM>Making a Killing: Philip Morris, Kraft and Global Tobacco Addiction </EM>reveals the ugly truth about the tobacco giant, a $62 billion corporation that uses outrageous tactics like the Marlboro Man to promote tobacco to young people, and exerts undue influence over public policy in every corner of the globe. </blockquote>

<b>WHO:

</b>

<blockquote>	<EM>Making a Killing </em>was produced and directed by award-winning filmmakers Kelly Anderson and Tami Gold, known for their hard-hitting documentaries. Anderson and Gold have been collaborating for more than ten years. In 1997 they completed<EM> Out At Work,</EM> which was screened at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, received a GLAAD Media Award for Best Documentary and aired on Home Box Office. Recent AndersonGold Films productions include<EM> Another Brother</EM> (directed by Tami Gold), about Vietnam Veteran and anti-war activist Clarence Fitch, which had a PBS national broadcast and was the recipient of the CINE Golden Eagle Award. <EM>Shift </EM>(directed by Kelly Anderson), a one hour ITVS drama, premiered at the Rotterdam International Film Festival and aired on public television stations nationally.

Executive producer Infact won an Academy Award for its 1991 film, <EM>Deadly Deception: General Electric, Nuclear Weapons, and our Environment. Deadly Deception</EM> was a key factor in pushing GE out of the nuclear weapons business. Since 1977, Infact has been exposing life-threatening abuses by transnational corporations and organizing successful grassroots campaigns to hold corporations accountable. From the Nestlé Boycott of the 1970’s and 1980’s over infant formula marketing, to the GE Boycott of the 1980’s and 1990’s over nuclear weapons production and promotion, to today’s Boycott of Philip Morris’s Kraft Foods, Infact organizes to win.



</blockquote>

<STRONG>WHY:</STRONG>	<blockquote>At their best, documentary films can be a powerful tool in the fight for social justice. Tapping this rich tradition, <EM>Making a Killing </EM>exposes Philip Morris’s deadliest abuses-and realizes the corporation’s worst fears. In a training manual for top management, Philip Morris has written, “Risk always exists that group [Infact] will use innovative tactic e.g. documentaries that could involve and activate a larger segment, particularly outside the US.” Now, that tactic is mobilizing growing numbers of consumers behind Infact’s Kraft Boycott-and <EM>Making a Killing </EM>will shock even those who believe they have seen it all from tobacco corporations.
