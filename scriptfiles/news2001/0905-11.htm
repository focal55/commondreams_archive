- September 5 - According to a new government report obtained by the Arms Trade Oversight

Project, licenses for weapons, spare parts and arms manufacturing

assistance totaled $55 billion in fiscal year 2000. This is a 100 percent

increase over licenses granted in 1998.  Combined with the Pentagon's $12.1

billion in foreign military sales in 2000, the U.S. authorized more than

$67 billion in arms sales last year.  This surge in license authorizations

to over 140 countries solidifies the U.S. as the world's dominant arms

merchant.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Project's analysis of the report (<a href="http://www.clw.org/atop/655analysis.html" target="_new">www.clw.org/atop/655analysis.html</a>)

shows that the U.S. government approved licenses worth tens of millions of

dollars for small arms and related materials to nearly every country in

Latin America.  In 2000, thirty-one of thirty-eight countries in Latin

America received some small arms related export licenses from the United

States. Licenses for weapons to Latin America included: 53,099 pistols and

revolvers valued at over $53 million, nearly 20,000 non-military rifles

valued at over $8 million, and over 195 million small caliber ammunition

cartridges valued at over $18 million.  These numbers show why the U.S.

doggedly fought efforts to restrain the trade in small arms and light

weapons at the recent conference UN conference on small arms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The State Department also granted licenses to countries in Latin America

that it cited in its previous human rights reports for human rights

violations.  State granted licenses for 2,372 pistols and revolvers for the

Dominican Republic, 7,775 pistols and revolvers for El Salvador, and 3,006

non-military rifles for Guatemala. Notably, Costa Rica, which has no

military, may receive over 24 million small caliber ammunition cartridges,

5,987 pistols and revolvers and 2,247 non-military rifles. Evidently over

half of Costa Rica's 8,400 paramilitary forces will have a new side arm

next year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remarkably, the U.S. granted licenses worth over $30.3 billion for

manufacturing and technical assistance in 2000, a figure that exceeds the

value of all licenses only two years before.  According to the report, the

rise in manufacturing and technical assistance agreements between the U.S.

and foreign countries reflects &quot;the growing complexity of commercial

defense trade as international joint ventures, co-production, licensed

manufacturing and offset arrangements involving offshore assembly or

procurement increasingly characterize major sales.&quot;  In other words, the

U.S. government is rapidly providing foreign countries the materials and

expertise necessary to build their own weapons.  Over the long term, this

will lead to a proliferation of weapons and manufacturing capabilities,

leaving the U.S. with less control over its weapons and manufacturing

expertise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures are part of the annual &quot;655 report,&quot; the primary public

disclosure of annual U.S. arms export licenses granted by the State

Department.  However, these figures do not represent the total amount of

weapons sold or delivered through the State Department's arms export

system, since not all licenses result in signed contracts or deliveries.</font></p>
