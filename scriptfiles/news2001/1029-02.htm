<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MARRAKECH 

- October 29  - Australia, Canada, Russia and Japan are attempting to undermine the landmark Bonn Agreement reached last July to finalize the rules for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement aimed at preventing dangerous climate change that open in Marrakech today, Greenpeace warned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 7th Conference of the Parties (COP7) of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) begins today in Morocco, to finalize the details of the Bonn Agreement. The Protocol was initially designed to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 5% but the rules which have already been agreed are so weak that it is now unlikely to achieve any reduction in greenhouse emissions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s vital that these next two weeks in Marrakech do not see the Protocol further weakened. Even the Protocol&#146;s nominal target of 5% reduction hardly started the process of making the 80% reductions needed to prevent dangerous levels of climate change,&quot; said Mr Bill Hare, Greenpeace climate policy director. &quot;Australia, Canada, Russia, and Japan must not be allowed to further weaken the Kyoto Protocol. Delegates must finish the job.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most countries have set a target of 2002 for ratification and implementation of the Protocol, and are moving towards that date; but a few, including Australia, Canada and Japan are still holding out on the final details before ratifying. The United States, which signed and ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, and signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, continues to state that it no longer intends to ratify or implement the Protocol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its ongoing attempt to avoid an agreement that has any legal consequences, Australia has tried to weaken the whole Protocol by substituting the word &quot;should&quot; for the world &quot;shall&quot; throughout the compliance agreement, weakening its legal power. Australia also wants to be able play with its figures on forestry and land use, and is trying to get the rules written so it doesn&#146;t even have to say exactly where the forests are. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan is extremely nervous about legally binding penalties for failing to meet its emission obligations. Canada also wants to weaken the requirement to report its sinks. Russia is demanding an even bigger sink allowance than it got in Bonn. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The USA is refusing to ratify the Protocol at all, but is still participating in negotiations. While the US has indicated it would come up with an alternative policy to address climate change, it has not done so. Greenpeace will be watching the US closely to see whether it attempts to block the Protocol or interfere with progress made by other participants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Throughout the next two weeks of talks, Greenpeace will be aiming to ensure that the Protocol is as environmentally effective as possible,&quot; said Mr Hare. &quot;It must not be muddied with diplomatic doubletalk and further weakened. The processes that underpin the Protocol must be transparent and open for public participation, and the Protocol itself must be backed by the full force of international law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Protocol remains the only international legal instrument designed to start the world on the road towards the massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are needed this century to avoid disastrous climate change. We cannot afford to let it be sacrificed to greed and shortsightedness.&quot; </font></p>
