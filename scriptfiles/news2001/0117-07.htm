- January 17 - The Sierra Club praises President Clinton for designating new

National Monuments in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Montana, Idaho and

the Virgin Islands. On Wednesday, January 17, President Clinton announced

permanent protection from commercial exploitation for eight monuments

including wild Missouri Breaks of north central Montana, Pompey's Pillar of

Montana, Sonoran Desert of Arizona, Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks of New Mexico,

U.S. Virgin Island Coral Reef National Monument, Buck Island Reef National

Monument (expansion), Minidoka Internment National Monument in Idaho, and

Carrizo Plain of California -- safeguarding inspiring and historic

landscapes for future generations to explore and enjoy.

<p>

"It's a joy to see President Clinton protecting recreational areas,

wildlife habitat, and historical sites threatened by destruction by oil and

gas extraction and real estate development," said Carl Pope, Sierra Club's

executive director.  "We are happy that President Clinton saved these

national treasures for future generations before they were destroyed

forever."

<p>

Some members of Congress have mentioned an interest in removing some of the

national monument designations the president had given public lands in

recent years. However, this will require an act of Congress. Americans

consistently poll in strong support of saving the United State's remaining

wild areas for future generations. The Sierra Club and other conservation

organizations plan to mobilize this overwhelming support to hold

congressional members accountable to the public's interests, versus the

campaign contributions of oil, gas and real estate developers.

<p>

Missouri Breaks is the last undeveloped portion of the Missouri River. The

landscape remains largely unchanged since Captains Meriwether Lewis and

William Clark set out to explore America's wildlands. The Missouri Break

covers over one hundred miles of wild river, travels through sandstone

formations and multicolored towers of rock, is a favorite recreational area

known for canoeing, and provides critical bird habitat.

<p>

Pompey's Pillar is a 200-foot high sandstone outcropping, which carries the

only physical evidence of the historic Lewis and Clark expedition. William

Clark signed his name into the sandstone pillar on July 25, 1806. The

outcropping is named for Sacajawea's baby, Little Pomp. From this lookout,

one can see a breathtaking view of the Yellowstone River and Bighorn

Mountains.

<p>

"Two Montana National Monuments make the best gift we could ever give our

children to begin 2001," said Mary Wiper, conservation organizer with

Sierra Club Montana Chapter. "These designations safeguard the wild

corridor of the Missouri and Pompey's Pillar marks the sole physical

evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition.  We applaud setting aside these

places as monuments for our families and our future."

<p>

The Carrizo Plain of California contains some of the last remnants of the

vast, sweeping grasslands which used to be common throughout the San

Joaquin Valley. Located between the coastal ranges of  San Luis Obispo

County in the southern San Joaquin Valley, the Plain provides a refuge for

the greatest concentration of threatened and endangered species in the

state. Threatened species found in the area include the San Joaquin kit

fox, giant kangaroo rat, blunt nosed leopard lizard, and sandhill cranes,

among many others.  It also harbors a number of rare plants, including the

California jewel flower, which is found in only one other place in the

world, and is a sacred area for Native Americans.

<p>

"Carrizo Plain is a sweeping landscape that has all but disappeared in

California," said Holly Sletteland, Conservation Chair of the Sierra Club

Santa Lucia Chapter. "I'm glad to see that this is one place where it will

remain forever."

<p>

The Sonoran Desert National Monument protects nearly 500,000 acres of

spectacular desert mountains and saguaro-covered plains only 30 air miles

from Phoenix, AZ, one of the nation's fastest growing urban areas. The

monument will preserve for all time habitat for desert bighorn sheep and

desert tortoise, and will protect fragile cultural sites for several nearby

Native American tribes.

<p>

"The Sonoran desert is the most biologically rich in North America, but

it's being bulldozed away before urban sprawl," said Rob Smith, Sierra Club

Southwest Representative. This monument protects America's classic Sonoran

desert landscape for future generations -- knife-like mountain peaks, vast

valleys and one of the finest Saguaro forests in the world."

<p>

The Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument is approximately 4,100 acres

in north-central New Mexico near Santa Fe. The area includes volcanic

features such as cone-shaped tent rocks, as well as pumice, ash and other

deposits from volcanic eruptions between 6 million and 7 million years ago.

<p>

"The creation of the Kasha-Katuwe/Tent Rocks National Monument is a symbol

of Americans working together to preserve their public wildlands," said

Martin Heinrich, member of the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club. "This

monument has broad support ranging from Native American leaders at Cochiti

Pueblo, to urban hikers in Santa Fe, to county commissioners in rural

Sandoval County. It shows what we all know in our hearts that Americans

care passionately for their public lands and will work together to protect

them."
