- February 7 - President George W. Bush's announcement yesterday that he

will use the outgoing Clinton Administration's fiscal 2002 Defense

Department budget request has sparked a wave of controversy.  An

opinion-editorial in the February 7 Washington Post blasts President Bush

for failing to provide a significant increase, while a New York Times

editorial praises his decision not to provide new funds.  However, no one in the debate acknowledges that the request still represents a sizable

increase.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The $310 billion figure is a $19 billion increase from the fiscal 2001

request,&quot;  said John Isaacs, President of the defense reform group Council

for a Livable World. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The $310 billion request does not include Department of Energy nuclear

weapons activities and congressional add-ons.  The fiscal 2001 request for

DOE defense programs was $14.3 billion and each of the last two years

Congress has added $4.5 billion in defense spending to the administration's

request.  For fiscal 1998 total defense spending was budgeted at $271.3

billion.  By fiscal 2001 that number had reached $310 billion and will

increase by at least $19 billion in fiscal 2002.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Military spending has risen dramatically the last few years,&quot; claimed

Isaacs.  &quot;Meanwhile we are spending more than the next 12 biggest defense

spenders combined,&quot; Isaacs argued, &quot;We spend more than three times the

amount of all our potential enemies combined.  Just the increase from

fiscal 2000 to 2001 was greater than the entire State Department budget and

just the research budget of the Pentagon is greater then all federal

education expenditures.  Military spending has reached almost 95 percent of

the Cold War average.  In fact, the Pentagon budget is greater now then it

was when Mr. Rumsfeld finished his first term as Secretary of Defense.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Massive investments in defense are not necessary to fulfill Bush's promise

to strengthen national defense.  Simply eliminating billions in unneeded

Cold War era weapons could free up funds for other priorities such as

readiness and advanced weapons research.  Fixing the Pentagon's accounting

problems would save billions while solving spare parts problems.  Closing

unnecessary bases will save $3-5 billion annually and removing &quot;Buy America&quot; provisions that require the procurement of products made in the

U.S. could save $5-7 billion a year.  According to Sen. John McCain (R-AZ),

the Senate's top pork buster, Congress added $7 billion in unrequested

spending to the fiscal 2001 defense spending bill.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Seven billion dollars would easily pay for the readiness shortfalls cited

by the Pentagon,&quot; added Isaacs.  &quot;Revising the Pentagon's unrealistic two

war strategy, which defines the size of the military and its procurement

needs, to something less ambitious and more sane, would also alleviate many

readiness problems,&quot; Isaacs concluded.  </font></p>
