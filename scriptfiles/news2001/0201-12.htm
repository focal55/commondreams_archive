- February 1 - The Senate's narrow confirmation of John Ashcroft as

Attorney General today is a warming against weakening enforcement of

environmental safeguards, the Sierra Club said today.  Ashcroft's past

opposition to laws protecting our families from pollution generated serious

concerns about whether he will vigorously enforce these laws as attorney

general.  The Sierra Club praised those Senators who voted against

Ashcroft's nomination.

<p>

"The narrow vote puts John Ashcroft on notice that he should not let

corporate polluters off the hook as America's top environmental cop," said

Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.  "America needs an

attorney general who will aggressively protect our families from polluters

who poison the air we breathe and the water we drink.  In his hearing,

Ashcroft pledged to uphold the laws safeguarding our families from

pollution, and we'll make sure he doesn't duck that commitment.  We applaud

those Senators who voted against Ashcroft to protect America's environment

for our families and for our futures.

<p>

"Those Senators who voted for Mr. Ashcroft are now obligated to ensure that

he aggressively enforce our environmental laws to provide clean air and water for all Americans," added Pope.

<p>

While in the Senate, Ashcroft voted against additional funding for

environmental programs including the Clean Water Action Plan and toxic

waste cleanups at Superfund sites.  He also voted in favor of bills to roll

back clean water protections, to prevent the EPA from enforcing arsenic standards for drinking water, and to allow mining companies to dump cyanide

and other mining waste on large areas of public lands next to mining sites.

As attorney general, it will be his duty to enforce these protections.

<p>

During his confirmation hearings, Senator Ashcroft was asked specifically

whether he would "aggressively defend and uphold" President Clinton's plan

to protect 60 million acres of wild, roadless areas in our National Forests

from destruction.  Senator Ashcroft stated "I will, regardless of whether

or not I supported something as a senator, defend the rule. And if it is a

rule with the force and effect of law, I will defend those cases."  The Sierra Club will hold him accountable to his promise to defend the

protection of these pristine 60 million acres.

<p>

The Sierra Club worked to block Ashcroft's appointment by mobilizing its

more than 630,000 members and by working in coalition with environmental,

civil rights, and other organizations to educate the public about

Ashcroft's bleak environmental record.
