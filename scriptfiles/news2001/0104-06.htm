- January 4 - "Once again, over the wishes of a clear majority of his

constituents, Governor John Engler has pandered to the gun lobby

and signed a bill weakening the state's concealed weapons law.

Citizens who truly favor safer streets are sadly disappointed in

their government.

<p>"Under this bill, persons applying to carry a hidden handgun

would no longer have to show need for carrying a gun. Furthermore,

county gun boards and local law enforcement would no longer have

any discretion when it comes to issuing concealed weapons permits.

This means that anyone who can legally own a gun and who goes

through minimal safety training would be able to carry it on

Michigan streets. It is a slap in the face to law enforcement who

go through regular training in the use of deadly force that

lawmakers have seen fit to ignore the views of the men and women

who put their lives on the line to enforce the law.

<p>"I think we all know people who may not be criminals but who

have bad tempers, who have poor judgment or who carry grudges.

This bill would force the people of Michigan to wonder if the

person sitting next to them in the movie theater, standing in line

behind them in the grocery store, or waiting with them in line for

the bus is carrying a loaded gun.

<p>"This bill requires only eight hours of firearms training. The

Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police has pointed out that every

law enforcement officer is required to undergo 72 hours of firearms

training with recertification in firearms proficiency at least once

a year. Little wonder then that this measure has been fiercely

opposed by Michigan law enforcement, prosecutors, the clergy and

the medical community. A December 10 EPIC/MRA poll showed that 55

percent of Michigan voters oppose this bill.

<p>"Unfortunately, Michigan lawmakers are not listening to their

constituents, prosecutors or those who know best how to protect

public safety. Despite the legislature's obvious intent to

suppress the will of the people by including appropriations

language, HCI feels certain that this bill will not stand. We

support Michigan's People Who Care About Kids and all other

community groups' efforts to overturn this CCW bill, and encourage

them to bring this issue to the voters who can let their true

feelings be heard.

<p>"Mark my words: this insult to caring Michigan citizens will not

go unnoticed, and will not be forgotten."

<i>Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by

Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun

violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law

enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across

the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun

control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has over

500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it the nation's

largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More

information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to

Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our Web site at
