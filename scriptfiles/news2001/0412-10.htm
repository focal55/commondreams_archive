- April 12 - Today, US District Court Judge Gladys Kessler approved a  settlement agreement between Bluewater Network and the National Park

Service (NPS) regarding personal watercraft (PWC) use in the National

Parks.  PWC, better known by the trade name jet ski, are motorized

thrill-craft which have been shown to cause significant damage to air and

water quality, visitor enjoyment, public health and safety, natural quiet and wildlife.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March of last year, the NPS adopted regulations which permitted PWC

operation to continue in the 21 parks where operation is most prevalent.

Bluewater Network brought suit against the NPS in August, arguing that PWC

operation in the National Parks violated the Park Service's legal mandate

to leave park resources unimpaired.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The settlement, finalized during the Bush Administration, requires the Park

Service to prohibit the thrill-craft at these 21 parks unless the agency

undertakes a park-specific rulemaking process which complies with

environmental reviews as required by the National Environmental Policy Act.

 The settlement also guarantees public involvement in any rulemaking

process.  Jet ski operation may continue in these 21 parks while the NPS

undergoes the rulemaking process.  However, the settlement stipulates that

the process must be completed no later than the fall of 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Personal Watercraft Industry Association and the American Watercraft

Association - PWC industry trade groups - were also handed a stunning

defeat by the court when their motion to intervene in the case was denied.

In a strongly worded order, Judge Kessler ruled that the PWC industry's

interests would not be injured by the terms of the settlement and therefore

the industry had no standing to intervene in this matter.  The nine page

order also stated that some of industry's claims bordered on the &quot;frivolous.&quot;  Moreover, Judge Kessler found that approving industry's

request might block the establishment of an &quot;open, fair, and accountable&quot;

public process regarding the authorization of PWC use in the National

Parks.  Given the industry's weak claims, Judge Kessler saw &quot;no good

reason&quot; to unduly delay resolution of the case by granting the motion to

intervene.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater Network, the lead plaintiff in the case, hailed Judge Kessler's

action.  &quot;This jetski settlement is great news for the National Parks,&quot;

said Sean Smith Public Lands Director for Bluewater Network and a former

National Park Ranger.  &quot;It will better protect the visiting public as well

as park resources and wildlife from these noisy, smelly and dangerous

machines.&quot;</font></p>
