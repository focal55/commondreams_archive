- March 12 - One third of the savings under the Bush tax proposal would

go to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, while one third

of taxpayers would receive less than $200 in tax relief. "It



doesn't take a rocket scientist to calculate that the average

working woman is getting virtually no tax cut while Bush's wealthiest



friends will get the majority of the proposed $1.6 trillion



cut," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority



Foundation.

<p>According to the 1999 Population Survey by the U.S. Census



Bureau, women have a median income of $26,324, compared to men's



median income of $36,476. Under the Bush plan, the tax rate on



the first $6,000 earned by single people and the first $12,000



earned by married couples drops from 15 percent to 10 percent.



But the next tax bracket, $6,001-$27,050, representing 84



percent of women, gets no tax relief at all.

<p>"Working women need tax relief most of all yet they are left



out of the equation," continued Smeal. "I ask President Bush



what is compassionate about helping the rich get richer and the



poor get poorer?"
