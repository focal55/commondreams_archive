(D-Ohio) today called a report in today's Washington Post, &quot;Al 

Qaeda Cash Tied to Diamond Trade; Sale of Gems from Sierra Leone 

Rebels Raised Millions, Sources Say,&quot; more evidence that ending the 

trade in conflict diamonds ought to be a top priority for Congress. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Reports in today's Washington Post suggest recent years' 

efforts by US intelligence agencies, the Clinton and Bush 

Administrations, the Congress and industry watch-dogs to end the 

trade in conflict diamonds not only have failed -- but have been so 

impotent that they allowed terrorists to fill the coffers that 

support their attacks on Americans,&quot; Hall said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've known for a long time that shady operators, including an 

organization the State Department calls a terrorist group -- the 

Revolutionary United Front -- were earning hundreds of millions of 

dollars a year from this blood trade,&quot; he said. &quot;If this report is 

accurate, we've also known exactly who was collecting some of that 

money: to Osama bin Laden.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Al Qaeda's workings may be news to most Americans, and the link 

between the money we spend on tokens of love and terror ought to 

shock consumers and the jewelers who employ tens of thousands of 

people in communities across our country alike. Conflict diamonds' 

exploitation by terrorists appears to have been well known to our 

intelligence agencies, and yet Congress still has not acted on any 

of the bills introduced over the course of two years. All of them 

aimed to sever the link that brutal rebels used to fund their 

operations - and that terrorists have been milking,&quot; Hall said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I don't fault US policymakers or civil servants for failing to 

predict how terrorists would use this blood money,&quot; he added. &quot;But 

our collective failure, along with the diamond industry's, has been 

to treat those who commit acts of terror differently when the 

victims are innocent Africans. Any terrorist organization -- 

including the RUF -- ought to have been targeted long before it 

claims U.S. victims. That didn't happen, and the result is our job 

is now much harder and the threat to Americans much greater. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is a sorry day for me, and for everyone who has known this 

blood trade is funding terror but has been unable or unwilling to 

stop it,&quot; Hall said. &quot;I urge Congress to act immediately on 

legislation to right this wrong before more innocent people -- 

Africans or Americans -- suffer crimes that are funded in part by 

the Americans who buy the majority of the world's diamonds.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hall is an original author of the Clean Diamond Trade Act, HR 

2722. It is the sixth bill he has sponsored to end the trade in 

conflict diamonds since late 1999, when he visited Sierra Leone and 

Guinea with U.S. Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-VA). The House bill's 

lead sponsors are Rep. Amo Houghton (R-NY) and Rep. Charles Rangel 

(D-NY). Sponsors of its Senate companion, S 1084, are Sen. Dick 

Durbin (D-IL), Sen. Mike DeWine (R-OH), and Sen. Russ Feingold 

(D-WI). The bills have the support of a coalition of more than 

100 humanitarian, human rights and faith groups, and of the 

diamond and jewelry industries. </font></p>
