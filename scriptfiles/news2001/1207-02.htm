- December 7 - Officers of the Green Party of the

United States have just returned from meetings in

Europe with legislators and other officials who are

members of various European Green Parties.  Meanwhile,

Green activist Medea Benjamin, founder of the

non-profit organization Global Exchange and 2000 Green

Party candidate for U.S. Senator from California, and

three other women from Global Exchange recently

returned from a fact-finding trip to Afghanistan and

Pakistan.  On Thursday, December 6, they released a

report describing their findings and offering

recommendations to the Bush Administration about how

to alleviate the suffering of Afghanistan's civilian

population (&quot;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/1206-07.htm">Reconstructing Afghanistan: Statement by

Global Exchange Women's Delegation to the Region</a>&quot;.)</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. bombing has created a whole new class of

refugees, most of whom are not receiving any kind of

aid,&quot; said Ms. Benjamin.  &quot;The U.S. therefore has an

tremendous responsibility to ensure that the refugees

we have created do not die from lack of food.  We need

U.N. peacekeepers in Afghanistan now to get food to

people. The U.S. must today end its resistance to an

international peacekeeping force. It is unconscionable

for the U.S. to frustrate humanitarian efforts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The contingent from Global Exchange has been working

closely with the Revolutionary Association of the

Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), Afghan Womens Mission,

Afghan Womens Council, and Afghan Womens Network, all

of which have demanded that women be included in the

plans for reconstructing Afghanistan and in the Bonn

talks on establishing a new Afghan government.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Annie Goeke, chair of the International Committee of

the Green Party of the United States, Tom Sevigny, a

member of the party's national Steering Committee, and

Green Party Political Coordinator Dean Myerson met

last week with Belgian Green Party Minister Jean Marc

Nollet, a United Nations representative, to discuss

Children's Rights and a campaign to protest the U.S.'s

refusal to sign on to the Child Rights International

Treaty.  They also discussed strategies to address

global warming and control carbon dioxide (greenhouse

gas) emissions with Olivier Deleuze, chair of the

European Parliament.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Green Parties on both sides of the Atlantic have

continued to develop and meetings during this visit

promise to move our cooperation to a new level of

practical coordination to build the Green Party

globally and get real results on Green issues,&quot;

commented Myerson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We emphasized to European Greens that they are in a

position to embarrass U.S. government officials for

their inaction or bad policies, and that our own

experience in the U.S. political system can help them

do so, thus getting more results on many issues of

common concern.  This is the next step for the Earth's

only global political party to combine the leverage of

European Greens in governmental positions with our

new-found growth and impact to affect U.S. policies in

a way not expected by the elites in the U.S.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goeke, Sevigny, and Myerson spoke at a public forum

attended by officials from the European Federation of

Green Parties (EFGP) in the Maison des Femmes,

discussing the U.S. Green Party's goals and clarifying

the party's position on the War in Afghanistan:

disagreement with the German Greens' decision under

the leadership of Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to

support the U.S.'s unilaterally conducted military

strikes; calling for an international court to try the

criminals behind the September 11 attacks in accord

with international law; demand for representation from

Afghan women's organizations in the Bonn talks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They later met Arnold Cassola, Secretary General for

EFGP, and officials from the European Parliament Green

Group and from the Heinrich Boell Foundation, which

supports and coordinates the Green movement in

Germany.  Greens in Europe and the U.S. plan to

participate in the 2nd World Social Forum (WSF) in

Porto Alegre, Brazil, from January 31 to February 5,

2002.  About 100,000 people attended the first WSF in

2001, an initiative of international NGOs that

presented a democratic alternative to the

Globalization Forum in Davos, Switzerland. </font></p>

Budapest at the European Federation of Green Parties

Council meeting on international security; Annie Goeke

Lille. </font></p>
