- June 19 - More than 50 leaders 

in the arts and entertainment community -- including Robin 

Williams, Ben Stiller, William Baldwin and Jane Alexander -- 

have urged Senators Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), Hillary Rodham 

Clinton (D-N.Y.), Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Herb Kohl (D-Wis.) 

to withdraw their support for the Media Marketing Accountability 

Act of 2001 (S. 792). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to the Senators from members of The Creative 

Coalition and others in the entertainment and arts communities, 

the signatories warned that the proposed legislation may violate 

the First Amendment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed legislation will give the Federal Trade 

Commission (FTC) control over the way adult rated entertainment 

-- movies, music and video games -- is marketed. It empowers 

the FTC to impose fines on entertainment companies that market 

adult rated products to children. For the first time, the 

concept of &quot;deceptive&quot; advertising practices would be linked to 

the content of creative products. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actor and President of The Creative Coalition William Baldwin 

said, &quot;A governmental role in defining 'acceptable' 

entertainment is an indirect form of censorship. There are 

better, more workable and more tolerant solutions. We appeal to 

consumers, parents and policymakers to continue to encourage the 

entertainment industry to improve its ratings systems and 

marketing practices through non-legislative actions. The threat 

of civil penalties is an extreme reaction to a problem whose 

solution lies in voluntary self-regulation by the creative 

industries, action these industries have successfully undertaken 

and continue to improve upon. Responsible adults should not be 

subject to having their choices restricted or monitored by the 

government.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other signatories to the position letter include: Adam 

Arkin; Lauren Bacall; Richard Belzer; HBO Chairman &amp; CEO Jeff 

Bewkes; Chevy Chase; Wes Craven; Alan Cumming; Reporters 

Committee for Freedom of the Press Executive Director, Lucy 

Dalglish; Bo Derek; Olympia Dukakis; Hector Elizondo; Harvey 

Fierstein; producer Tom Fontana (Oz, Homicide); Michael P.

Lawford; Interactive Digital Software Association President Doug 

Lowenstein; Ron Reagan; producer Amy Robinson (Autumn in New 

York); Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
