- April 18 - Investors with 88.9 

million shares of Coca-Cola stock, worth more

than 4 billion dollars, voted to support a shareholder 

resolution on recycling at the company's

annual meeting today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Supporters of the recycling resolution secured enough 

support to bring the proposal back again

next year, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange 

Commission rules governing shareholder

proposals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We did better than expected.  When you combine the

yes votes and those who abstained, roughly 10 percent 

of the votes went against the Coca-Cola management's 

recommendation opposing the recycling resolution.  

That's an excellent result for a first vote on any 

shareholder resolution,&quot; said Lance King, speaking 

on behalf of environmental groups and individual 

investors supporting the recycling proposal 

(Item 5) on Coke's agenda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conrad MacKerron, representing the Education 

Foundation of America and Walden Asset Management,

co-sponsors of the shareholder resolution, made 

the presentation in support of the shareholder

proposal.  The non-binding proposal calls for 

Coca-Cola to achieve two specific recycling goals by

January 1, 2005:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;	Make plastic bottles with 25 percent 

	recycled plastic; and

&middot;	Take steps to achieve an 80 percent 

	recycling rate for Coke bottles and cans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Recycling rates for beverages sold by Coca-Cola 

and its competitors dropped dramatically in recent 

years, as plastic bottles and other throwaway beverage

containers proliferate,&quot; said Pat Franklin, a Coke 

shareholder and executive director of the nonprofit

Container Recycling Institute, based in Arlington, Virginia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO Douglas Daft made two

significant announcements in response to

the shareholder proposal on recycling.  First, 

Daft said that Coca-Cola plans to use 10 percent

recycled plastic in its bottles by 2005.  Second, 

Daft said Coke is working with a newly formed

alliance called BEAR - Businesses and Environmentalists 

Allied for Recycling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In a question and answer session, Bill Sheehan of

the GrassRoots Recycling Network noted that Coke 

uses 25 percent recycled plastic in other countries, 

such as Daft's native Australia, and Sheehan asked 

&quot;why not in the United States?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sheehan also presented a letter in support of the 

shareholder resolution on recycling, addressed

to the Coca-Cola Board of Directors, and signed by 

76 investors, public officials, businesses,

environmental and community leaders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob Woodall, an Atlanta-shareholder and executive 

director of Waste Not Georgia, said after the

vote:  &quot;Unless a financial incentive is established, 

like the refundable deposits in 10 states with bottle 

bill laws, Coke will find it difficult or impossible 

to meet the goal of making plastic bottles with 10 

percent recycled plastic.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Institutional investors co-sponsoring the shareholder 

recycling resolution called on Coca-Cola to stop 

opposing bottle bills or come up with another method 

to achieve the 80 percent recycling rate, which is the 

current average in states with refundable deposits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The vote today assures shareholders that recycling 

will stay on the agenda in discussion with top

management at Coca-Cola and can be brought back again 

next year, if necessary.  Coca-Cola is

beginning to address the problem,&quot; King said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pepsi, by contrast, is doing nothing to address 

these problems and fought unsuccessfully before

the SEC to block a similar shareholder recycling 

proposal, according to the environmental groups.

The Pepsi shareholder vote is scheduled May 2 in 

Dallas, Texas.
