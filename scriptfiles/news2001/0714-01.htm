- July 14 -  News Advisory:

<p>The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) is

scheduled to conduct the fourth test of its ground-based NMD

interceptor this Saturday, July 14, between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. EDT.

BMDO will launch an interceptor from the Kwajalein Atoll in the

Pacific that will attempt to hit a target launched from Vandenberg

AFB in California. Saturday's $100 million test will be a repeat of

the July 8, 2000, NMD flight test, which failed to hit the target.

<p>Earlier this week, Bush Administration officials asked Congress



to approve a new missile defense research, development and testing



program that they say will come into conflict with the 1972



Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty within "months, not years."



This reflects the Administration's wish to have a rudimentary



national missile defense capability by 2004, whether or not it has



been proven to be reliable and effective. Such a crash deployment



would provide illusory protection from potential long-range missile



threats, while at the same time violating the ABM Treaty and



setting off a dangerous action-reaction cycle involving the United

States, Russia, and China.

<p>The following experts will be available for comment and analysis
