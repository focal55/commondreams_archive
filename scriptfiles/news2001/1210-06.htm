- December 10 - Common Cause hosted a press conference Monday January 10 at the 

            National Press Club in Washington to support free and open debate 

            during wartime and to urge Attorney General Ashcroft to fulfill his 

            oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also participating were: Laura Murphy of the American Civil Liberties 

            Union; Morton Halperin from the Council on Foreign Relations, Jerry 

            Berman from the Center for Democracy and Technology, Joe Onek from 

            The Constitution Project; and Stephanie Foster from the People For 

            the American Way. </font></p>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Thank you all for coming. 

          </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At Common Cause, we believe this is a just war, and we 

support President Bush and our war effort.  We all 

oppose terrorism in all its forms. We all oppose those 

who would seek to end what the free world has fought for. 

And that is why we stand by the Constitution.  That is 

why we seek to make sure that we as a nation even in 

times of crisis do not in any way negate what so many 

have fought and died for. 



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We had just hoped for more.  We hoped Attorney General 

Ashcroft, too, would rise to the occasion, like the 

President and Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld.  

As patriots, we hoped he'd at least have tried to show 

us the way in this crisis, not just representing his 

client, or following the public will, or playing to the 

lowest common denominator or fears, but showing us how 

to have it all - safety and security and our values, 

which include healthy, open, positive patriotic debate...



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are here, a diverse bunch, because what unites us as 

Americans is so much greater than what divides us.

Attorney General Ashcroft's remarks suggest that isn't so.  

He went over the line last week in claiming his critics 

give aid and comfort to our enemies.  Mr. Ashcroft swore 

an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, but that 

doesn't make him its only defender.  The oath is just a 

reminder  -- it is every American's duty to hold government 

accountable, just as it is every American's responsibility 

to protect and defend the Constitution.  



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A true patriot does not criticize those who do so, he 

recognizes that questioning government is one of the 

highest forms of patriotism. Instead, Mr. Ashcroft's 

remarks may have a chilling effect on our Constitution 

and our values.  



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no doubt that during wartime, the United 

States must act strongly to defend all our interests 

at the expense of others' rights.



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a former prosecutor, I am inclined to give Attorney 

General Ashcroft the tools he thinks he needs to do 

his job, especially on a temporary basis.  Because 

after all, no one can deny there is a clear and present 

danger to ourselves and our fellow citizens. 



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But we expect an Attorney General to lead, to be a tough 

but smart advocate for our law and for law and order. 

To protect and to preserve our Constitution, especially 

in a time of war. Above all, to encourage debate, 

discussion, education, input and then to take the heat 

and act, but never to chill debate and discussion by 

saying it aids the enemy.  An Attorney General should 

set an example for citizens, lay people, civil and 

military authority, of what it means to live within 

and for a government of laws and constitutional values. 

 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Attorney General exempted Congress from his criticism, 

but if you follow his logic, Congressman Bob Barr, 

a former U.S. attorney and CIA analyst, and Senator 

Patrick Leahy, the intended victim of one of the anthrax 

letters, are helping Al Qaeda.  That's flat-out wrong, 

and while Senator Leahy and Congressman Barr can take 

care of themselves, I worry for other Americans 

who criticize the Attorney General.



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the President has cautioned, this is a new kind of war.  

Mr. Ashcroft's comments are especially disturbing because, 

as Attorney General, he is the member of the cabinet 

responsible for ensuring today's crisis does not 

become precedent for tomorrow's abuses.  



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Ashcroft should be clear that he has two mandates 

to protect our national security:  to lead the country's 

law enforcement efforts, and to protect and defend the Constitution.  

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He must do both."
