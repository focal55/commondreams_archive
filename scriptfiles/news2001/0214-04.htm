- February 14 -  The Human Rights Campaign joined a coalition of organizations 

  at a news conference today to praise the introduction by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, 

  D-N.Y., of legislation that would provide same-sex partners of U.S. citizens 

  and lawful permanent residents the same immigration rights legal spouses of 

  U.S. residents enjoy.

<p> &#147;This bill will help end the unjust and cruel separation of families,&#148; 

  said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg. &#147;We applaud Congressman 

  Nadler for taking this initiative and recognizing that immigration law is supposed 

  to be based on protecting families and not tearing them apart based on sexual 

  orientation.&#148; </p>

<p>The Permanent Partners Immigration Act, sponsored by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., 

  would modify the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. Currently, U.S. immigration 

  law does not allow lesbian and gay citizens or permanent residents to petition 

  for their same-sex partners to immigrate. About 75 percent of the one million 

  green cards, or immigrant visas, issued yearly go to family members of U.S. 

  citizens and permanent residents. However, those excluded from the INA&#146;s 

  current definition of family include same-sex partners, unmarried heterosexual 

  couples and other family members.</p>

<p>Each year, current law forces thousands of lesbian and gay couples to break 

  up or live in constant fear of deportation. In some cases, partners of lesbians 

  and gays face prosecution by the Immigration and Naturalization Services, hefty 

  fines and deportation, and U.S. citizens are sometimes left with no other choice 

  but to migrate with their partner to a nation whose immigration laws recognize 

  their relationship.</p>

<p>Fourteen countries recognize lesbian and gay couples for the purposes of immigration: 

  Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Israel, the Netherlands, 

  New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Lesbian and Gay Immigration Rights Task Force, a New York-based organization 

  addressing the widespread discriminatory impact of immigration laws on lesbians 

  and gays, anticipates same-sex binational couples will have to meet the same 

  requirements as married couples do. Last year, the Permanent Partners Immigration 

  Act quickly garnered the support of nearly 60 congressional cosponsors.</p>

<p><i>HRC is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization with members 

  throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support 

  and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, 

  honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.
