        to smallpox terrorism becomes clearer, Congress is set to give budget-busting 

        hand-outs to the wealthiest individuals and corporations. The $100 billion 

        stimulus bill, H.R. 3090, scheduled to come before the House of Representatives, 

        would not only be ineffective for economic recovery, it would be a dangerous 

        misuse of funds urgently needed for crisis response.</font>

<ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">A hundred 

          million antibiotic treatments for anthrax infection and better baggage 

          screening machines at every U.S. airport would cost less than the $12.8 

          billion speed-up of income tax rate reductions for the best-off 30% 

          of taxpayers.</font></font></li>

          the Centers for Disease Control budget, extending unemployment benefits 

          for three million people for 13 weeks, federalizing airport security 

          with no ticket price increases, and modernizing Amtrak would cost less 

          than the $40.2 billion tax cut for accelerated depreciation.</font></font></li>

      </ul>

      <ul>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Fourteen 

          profitable corporations such as IBM and General Motors would get $6.3 

          billion in rebates of their Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) payments back 

          to 1986. These companies together had in 2000 a net worth of over $217 

          billion and $43 billion in cash in the bank. Total AMT rebates would 

          cost $25 billion, more than the total value of the rebates the bill 

          gives to the 39% of American households who didn&#146;t get a full rebate 

          this summer. </font></font></li>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">&quot;I&#146;d be embarrassed to take a tax cut at a time like this,&quot; 

        says New York RW member Richard Perl, President of Pacific Partners International 

        Investments, Inc. &quot;With so many in my city grieving, digging through 

        rubble, and losing their jobs, my government should be asking me to pitch 

        in, not handing me a bonus. The priorities of this stimulus package are 

        upside-down. It is not just ineffective, it&#146;s unpatriotic.&quot;</font></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">RW member Dal 

        LaMagna, CEO of Tweezerman Corporation in Glen Cove, NY, adds, &quot;We&#146;ve 

        had nine interest rate cuts this year and still nobody&#146;s investing. 

        Why should manufacturers like my company react any differently to tax 

        incentives? What drives businesses to expand is demand for our products, 

        so what we need is a tax and spending package that puts money into the 

        hands of people most likely to spend it.&quot; </font></font></p>
