American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) joined the American Civil



Liberties Union (ACLU) today in urging Congress not to pass any



hasty legislation in the name of anti-terrorism that would



compromise our civil liberties while providing questionable

additional security.

<p>In a news conference today in Washington at the National Press



Club, the newly formed coalition released a statement titled "In



Defense of Freedom at a Time of Crisis," that outlined the



concerns, and called for calm and deliberate consideration in the



weeks and months ahead. (Statement posted at

<a href="http://www.indefenseoffreedom.org" target="_new">www.indefenseoffreedom.org</a>/)

<p>While AAPS does not agree on every point or all wording of the



statement, AAPS Executive Director Jane M. Orient, M.D. said the



potential for violations was so great that action was necessary.

"We want to join in urging the government not to make haste to



destroy our country just to keep our adversaries from doing it



first. Let's have a calm, open appraisal of just where our

intelligence and security failed us."

<p>AAPS has long opposed a national ID card -- a proposal which has



been raised in the past to cope with immigration problems -- and



recently sued the government to halt national medical ID cards. "I



do think our immigration policy is a problem. It is misguided in



every direction. But the equivalent of electronic dog tags for

law-abiding citizens is unacceptable," said Dr. Orient.

<p>Dr. Orient warned that expanded law enforcement powers will only



result in civil liberties violations while creating a false sense



of security. "We should target law enforcement efforts to areas



where there is probable cause to think a crime is going on instead

of blanketing all Americans with police state surveillance."

<p>"The problem is not the lack of government power; it is the



misdirected use of government power. Problems will get worse, not



better, if the government is allowed to become more powerful

against individual rights," concluded Dr. Orient.

<p><i>AAPS is a non-partisan professional association of physicians



dedicated since 1943 to the protection of the patient-physician

relationship from third party intrusion.

</i>

<p><i>AAPS recently filed suit against the federal government to



protect patients' medical privacy, halt the establishment of a



national database of medical records, and prevent implementation of



national medical ID card. Information is posted at
