- January 16 - The American Friends Service Committee has established

an &quot;El Salvador Earthquake Relief and Reconstruction Fund&quot;

to respond to the widespread suffering and destruction in that

country in the aftermath of Saturday's earthquake. AFSC staff

in the region report that the earthquake has cut electricity to

many areas of the country and blocked many of El Salvador's mountain

roads.

<P>

&quot;AFSC has worked in El Salvador for nearly 50 years, accompanying

its people through the challenges of civil war, peacebuilding

and reconciliation, natural disasters, and long term projects

for economic and social justice,&quot; said AFSC General Secretary

Mary Ellen McNish. &quot;We will focus our relief and rebuilding

efforts among those rural communities most vulnerable and least

likely to get other assistance.&quot; 

<P>

AFSC is sending 4000 hygiene kits and has released $10,000 from

its Crisis Fund to pay for local purchase of emergency supplies

for earthquake survivors. AFSC staff on the ground assembled seven

truckloads of food, hygiene supplies, candles and tools for delivery

on January 15 from Honduras. 

<P>

Donations may be directed to AFSC, marked &quot;El Salvador Earthquake

Relief and Reconstruction,&quot; and mailed to: AFSC/Development,

1501 Cherry St., Philadelphia, PA 19102 . To contribute via Visa

or Mastercard, call 1-888-588-2372, ext. 1. 

<P>

The AFSC is not presently accepting material donations for El

Salvador.
