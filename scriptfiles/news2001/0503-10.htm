- May 3 -<i> &quot;On the predatory 

          lending side, some people have done unethical things. We don&#146;t 

          do that.&quot; </i></font>

<p align="right"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#151; 

          Bill F. Aldinger III, CEO, Household International, <br>

          in the Chicago Sun Times</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The executive 

        officers of the oldest and largest consumer finance company in the country, 

        Household International, have made public statements committing to business 

        practices free of predatory lending. Yet since North Carolina passed the 

        first state law banning predatory lending in 1999, Household International 

        has been second only to Citigroup in predatory lending complaints to the 

        state&#146;s banking commission.</font></p>

      

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shareholders 

        will present a resolution at Household International&#146;s annual meeting 

        on May 8 in Brandon, near Tampa, Florida, which would create a mechanism 

        for evaluating the company&#146;s officers in meeting their stated commitments 

        and would offer positive incentives for ending predatory lending practices 

        and ensuring fair treatment of customers.</font></p>

      

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Predatory 

        lending refers to the misleading packaging of high fees, costly credit 

        insurance and other charges into loans to unsophisticated borrowers. These 

        loans are often compounded by refinancings that, instead of benefiting 

        borrowers, primarily generate fees for lenders.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Household 

        International and other lenders have steadfastly opposed attempts by cities 

        and states to regulate the sale of high-fee, high-interest loans known 

        in the industry as subprime. A recent report by the Treasury Department 

        and Department of Housing and Urban Development states that &quot;evidence 

        from a number of cities demonstrates that foreclosure actions have grown 

        at a disturbing rate in inner city neighborhoods.&quot; According to HUD,

        subprime home loans rose nationally from 100,000 in 1993 to 1 million 

        in 1999, most often in predominantly black neighborhoods.</font></p>

      

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The 

        purpose of this resolution is to focus the company on a key issue of business 

        risk, as well as to break through the denial regarding abuses in the subprime 

        industry,&quot; says Julie Goodridge, president of Northstar Asset Management 

        and the Household International shareholder who will present Responsible 

        Wealth&#146;s resolution at the annual meeting.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Responsible 

        Wealth has also filed shareholder resolutions on executive compensation 

        at six other companies: Disney, FleetBoston, Citigroup, Exxon Mobil, Raytheon,
