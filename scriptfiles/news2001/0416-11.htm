- April 16 - This tax day, religious

leaders are raising questions and awareness about the

disproportionate amount of federal money flowing into the military

in contrast to the lack of funding available for human needs

programs that provide health care, education, job training and

nutrition programs to the disadvantaged and working poor.

<p>At a press conference at the National Press Club, The Interfaith

Alliance (TIA) joined religious leaders from the National Council

of Churches of Christ; Network, A National Catholic Social Justice

Lobby; the Muslim Public Affairs Council; and Pax Christi USA:

National Catholic Peace Movement to unveil Tax Day: How the Federal

Government Spends Your Income Tax, a report produced by the

National Priorities Project.

<p>The local report provides a detailed analysis of how federal

income tax dollars contributed by Washington, D.C., taxpayers are

spent on human services within the city in comparison to military

and defense funding. According to the data, which analyzes the

budget for the 2000-2001 fiscal year, 22 cents of every dollar from

D.C. residents' federal income taxes is used for military spending,

compared to 2 cents for city housing needs and half a penny for job

training.

<p>"The report findings illustrate the disturbing trend to spend

almost 50 percent of our discretionary budget on military and

defense, compared with fractions on education, nutrition programs

or job training," said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive

director of TIA. "These numbers reflect budget priorities that

clearly place a higher moral value on building weapons than

adequately funding programs which address the needs of the hungry,

suffering and struggling in our midst.

<p>"Our faith traditions instruct us to help, not abandon, those in

need. Our tax dollars should be distributed in a manner consistent

with our values as a society. How can we increase military

spending when 14 million children to go to bed hungry, when there

is a critical lack of affordable housing and when public schools

lack basics resources like textbooks and teachers?

<p>"Instead of increasing government resources for the working

poor, President Bush's faith-based initiative shifts federal

responsibility of social services to religious charities through a

plan that breeds religious competition, invites the political abuse

of religious groups, sanctions government funded religious

discrimination and undermines the autonomy of religion."

<p>To raise concerns about the budget priorities and the lack of

resources available to those in need, TIA will convene grassroots

forums to bring together local religious, civic and government

leaders to discuss the impact of President Bush's faith-based

proposal on the current needs of local communities. Findings from

these forums will be shared with elected leaders and officials in

the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.

<p><i>Founded in 1994, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan

clergy-led grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the

positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and

challenging those who manipulate religion to promote intolerance. </i>
