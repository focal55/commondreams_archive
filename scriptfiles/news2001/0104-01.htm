- January 4 - A coalition of United

States and Canadian conservation groups formally asked the U.S.

government today to use a federal statute, which includes the

threat of trade sanctions, to pressure Canada to stop a

controversial mining project proposed for British Columbia's

Taku River. The petition alleges that the Tulsequah Chief mine,

and a 95-mile access road that would slash through untouched

(and unprotected) wilderness, would harm essential habitat for

woodland caribou and grizzly bears, species protected by the

1942 Convention on Nature and Wild Life Preservation in the

Western Hemisphere.

<p>The petition cites the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the

Fishermen's Protective Act. That law requires the U.S.

Department of the Interior to determine whether another

country's actions "diminish the effectiveness" of international

environmental protection agreements. If the agency deems this to

be the case, it must "certify" the offending nation. The next

step can be the imposition of trade sanctions. Such

certifications have been issued in situations involving whaling

and the use of driftnets on the high seas. Certification led to

trade sanctions against Taiwan in 1994 for trading in body parts

of endangered rhinoceroses and tigers.

<p>"The Pelly certification process provides an opportunity for

the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, and ultimately the

President, to bring pressure to bear on Canada for failing to

take measures to protect the Taku River watershed and its

protected wildlife," said Eric Jorgensen, a lawyer for

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. "We hope action from the

Secretary will lead to a referral to the International Joint

Commission and, in the end, to rejection of the proposed

project."

<p>The petition was filed today by The Wilderness Society,

Natural Resources Defense Council, Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra

Club, National Audubon Society, American Rivers, Earthjustice

Legal Defense Fund, Southeast Alaska Conservation Council and

several Canadian conservation groups belonging to the

Transboundary Watershed Alliance (TWA) including Taku Wilderness

Association, Yukon Conservation Society and Sierra Legal Defense

Fund.

<p>"The Tulsequah Chief mine is precisely the type of action

that will drive Canadian and cross-border wildlife species into

oblivion," said Bill Snape, Vice President for Law and

Litigation for Defenders of Wildlife. "The woodland caribou has

already nearly disappeared from the U.S., and Canada lacks any

endangered species law to protect it or other imperiled wildlife

and habitat."

<p>"Our concerns that the grizzly bear and caribou populations

in the Taku will be irreversibly harmed if the mining project

that is being promoted by Redcorp Ventures Inc. and the province

of British Columbia goes forward have been ignored up to this

point," said Don Weir of the Taku Wilderness Association. "It is

our hope that the filing of the Pelly petition will draw

international attention to these vulnerable wildlife populations

and will focus on the fact that the government of Canada is not

adequately caring for these vulnerable species."

<p>"It is unusual for Canadians to petition the U.S. government

for protection of Canadian wilderness and wildlife, but we are

left with few other options," said Margot Venton, a Sierra Legal

staff lawyer. "B.C.'s environmental legislation locks our

clients out of the process and the environmental assessments

have ignored crucial information provided by conservationists.

Our governments appear hell-bent on approving the mine,

regardless of the cost."

<p>An environmental assessment of the project conducted jointly

by the Province of British Columbia and the federal government

of Canada in 1997 found that the project would not have

significant environmental impacts. At that point in the process,

the Canadian federal government had the option of initiating a

federal panel review on the environmental impacts that this

controversial mining project would have on the region but chose

not to take that action. Native groups opposed the finding and

went to court to challenge this assessment and, in June, the

B.C. Supreme Court ruled that the assessment was invalid since

it was done without relevant information about the potential

effects of the mine.

<p>"This intact, wild watershed is bigger than two Yellowstone

National Parks," Bart Koehler, spokesman for The Wilderness

Society. "And it is still free of roads, mines, and other

large-scale developments. It should remain wild and free. We

must protect this great North American treasure."
