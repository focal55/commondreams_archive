- April 19 - Greens from 70 countries who

gathered for the Global Greens 2001 Conference, which

took place in Canberra, Australia on April 14 to 16,

endorsed a boycott of major U.S.-based multinational

oil companies and their subsidiaries as a strategy to

pressure the Bush Administration to rejoin the Kyoto

Treaty.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March, George W. Bush withdrew the U.S. from the

international Kyoto agreement on measures to reverse

global warming, a policy that outraged governments and

media throughout the world who note that the U.S.,

with 4 percent of the world's population, uses about

25 percent of the world's energy resources.  The Kyoto

treaty establishes a protocol through which industrial

countries would cut carbon dioxide and other

greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2 percent

below 1990 levels by 2012.  Oil, coal, and other

corporations have lobbied American government

officials against such measures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green boycott targets oil companies that gave

major contributions to the Bush campaign in 2000:

Exxon-Mobil, Texaco, and Chevron. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Global Greens 2001 Conference was organized by the

Asia-Pacific Greens Network, the European Federation

of Green Parties, the African Federation of Green

Parties and the Federaci&oacute;n de Partidos Verdes de las

Americas.  The event drew over 700 participants,

including 300 delegates, from Green parties in Europe,

Africa, Latin America, the U.S. and Canada, Asia, and

the Pacific. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">15 Greens from the U.S. attended.  The official U.S.

delegates were Mike Feinstein, John Rensenbrink, and

Annie Goeke.  The alternates were Tony Affigne and Tod

Sloan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

ExxonMobil responds</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proving that oil execs have begun to fret about the

proposed boycott, ExxonMobil began to place ads in

major U.S. newspapers on Tuesday, April 17.  The ads,

posted at

&lt;<a href="http://www.exxonmobil.com/news/opeds/index.html">http://www.exxonmobil.com/news/opeds/index.html</a>&gt;,

call for deregulation, open markets, and voluntary

measures; offer scary warnings about &quot;public

toleration of major lifestyle changes&quot;; and blame the

stalemate at the Sixth Conference of the Parties of

the Convention on Climate Change, which took place at

the Hague in November, 2000, on &quot;fundamental flaws&quot; in

the Kyoto Protocols.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But deregulation, unrestrained markets, and voluntary

measures have caused the recent energy crisis in

California, have permitted the oil corporations to

undertake as little reform as possible, and have led

to power companies passing the bill for the high costs

of failed and unsafe nuclear plants on to consumers. 

Furthermore, the reason for the breakdown of the Hague

negotiations was obstruction by the U.S., as the

Clinton-Gore Administration caved in to the demands of

ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel lobbies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally disingenuous is ExxonMobil's claim that

renewable energy sources (solar and wind) &quot;face

serious technical, marketplace and political

barriers.&quot;  Fossil fuel lobbies have opposed

transition to such low-cost and self-sustaining

measures.  A cooperative President Bush has proposed

spending cuts of 54 percent for solar energy and 48

percent for wind energy, one of the cheapest and most

efficient energy sources known. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The April 9, 2001 issue of Business Week includes an

article, &quot;Exxon Unleashed: How the world's most

powerful corporation plans to dominate the new age of

oil exploration&quot;

on Exxon-Mobil's plans to exploit the current &quot;energy

crisis.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Swiss Green challenges the U.S. Greens for &quot;spoiling&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the Canberra Conference, a Green Party member

from Switzerland blamed Greens from the U.S. for

letting the Nader campaign &quot;spoil&quot; the 2000 election,

allowing George W. Bush's victory over Al Gore.  Swiss

delegate Hans Beat Schaffner pinned responsibility for

the U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Treaty on Ralph

Nader and American Greens and others who voted for

him, telling the conference, &quot;If they had only said he

would not be standing in Florida, we would not have

Bush now.&quot;  (Swiss Greens said later that Mr.

Schaffner was speaking on his own behalf, and not for

the party.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Matilda Banga, a Green delegate from Sierra Leone,

and Ingrid Betancourt, a member of the Parliament of

Colombia and a delegate from the Partido Verde

Oxigeno, stood up to defend American Greens and their

right to run candidates who challenge the corporate

domination of U.S. policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of ASGP, the federation of state parties that

nominated Ralph Nader to run for President in 2000,

recalled that the Clinton-Gore Administration had

already begun to sabotage the Kyoto Treaty.  In

deference to the same fossil fuel lobbies that now

dictate Bush policy, the U.S. delegation blocked

implementation of the Kyoto Protocols during the Hague

Conference Convention on Climate Change, this past

November. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an April 16 letter to Mr. Schaffner, former ASGP

secretary and Green activist Dean Myerson wrote, &quot;Are

you aware that the position of the Clinton

Administration was to pay other countries to lower

their carbon emissions so the USA would not have to? 

Are you aware that Mr. Gore disavowed any carbon taxes

or regulatory limitations on carbon emissions?  Are

you aware that the Clinton administration was

considered responsible for the breakdown of

negotiations to implement the Kyoto Treaty?  What

President Bush has done is to publicly admit what the

Clinton (and Gore) administration did as actual

practice.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASGP co-chair Steve Herrick said, &quot;The U.S. public has

a right to expect more from democracy than picking

which of two candidates will destroy the environment

and democracy more slowly than the other....  Our

purpose is to create a world with a clean environment

and clean politics.  This is our vision, and liberal

rhetoric or scare tactics will not distract us from

it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Global Green Charter endorsed unanimously</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference endorsed unanimously a Global Green

Charter calling for an international environmental

organization, a world court which would counteract

international &quot;free trade&quot; pacts that have nullified

environmental, labor, and human rights protections. 

Anti-democratic agreements such as NAFTA, the World

Trade Organization, and the Free Trade Agreement of

the Americas (FTAA), which is being negotiated this

coming weekend in Quebec, establish secretive

bureaucracies with the power to override such

protections in the name of corporate investment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A draft of the Charter (to be replaced shortly by the

final version) is posted at

&lt;<a href="http://www.global.greens.org.au/Charter.html">http://www.global.greens.org.au/Charter.html</a>&gt;.  The

Charter also calls for:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* All electoral systems to be based on proportional

representation </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Public funding and strict limits on corporate

donations in elections </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Bans on nuclear, chemical and biological weapons </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A tax on speculative financial transactions </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Immediate ratification of the Convention on

Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in

International Business </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Separation of state and religion </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Ratification of the Kyoto Protocol for a 5%

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions with a target of

20%-30% reduction by 2020 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Phasing out of nuclear power </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A worldwide ban on patenting of living creatures</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Reform or abolition of the World Trade Organization </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Domestic environmental laws to be applied to mining

and logging companies operating overseas </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The right of women to control their own fertility </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A ban on mandatory detention of asylum seekers </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Abolition of the death penalty worldwide </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* A 5 year moratorium on genetically engineered crops </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Removal of the veto power of the United Nations

Security Council </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Elimination of the debt burden on developing

countries</font></p>
