- January 18 - Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Springfield) announced at a press conference today his

  plans to introduce legislation to re-regulate the energy industry.  DeFazio, an outspoken opponent of energy deregulation, will introduce a bill when Congress reconvenes to

  reverse the 1992 Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act and re-regulate the energy industry.  The announcement came a day after Californians experienced rolling blackouts due

  to a shortage of energy.  DeFazio is Co-chairman of the Northwest Energy Caucus and a member of the House Resources Committee with jurisdiction over the Bonneville Power

  Administration.

  <p>

  "Yesterday was a dark day for Californians, but an extremely profitable day for a few giant power marketers," said DeFazio.  "Congress made a colossal mistake in `92, allowing

  the deregulation of wholesale production and distribution of energy.  The `92 Act eliminated the mandate that generators serve the public and provide stable, affordable, and

  reliable at-cost power.  We were left with private power buccaneers capitalizing on the energy crisis while we struggle to conserve, suffer from lost jobs, and brace for the

  lights to go out in our area.  I continue to support regional energy price caps for a short-term solution, but I think we need an aggressive solution for the long run.  We need

  to return to a regulated energy market, with stable, reliable, cost-based power.  That is why I'm introducing legislation to revoke the deregulation provision of the 1992 Energy

   Act and re-regulate the energy industry."

  <p>

  DeFazio was one of 60 House members to vote against the 1992 Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act that deregulated wholesale production and distribution of energy, and

  allowed individual states, like California, to go even further by deregulating retail energy production and distribution.  As a result, the West has been left with a

  decentralized, destabilized energy market.  Oregon is scheduled to begin deregulation in October of this year.

  <p>

  "The Oregon legislature should pull the plug on our state's deregulation experiment before the lights go out here, at home."
