- November 14 - On the heels of what has been called the greatest World Series

in recent memory, Major League Baseball owners last week voted

to eliminate two teams from the league next season, blaming a

mix of economic woes and lack of fan support. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But as the league prepares to announce which of its 30 teams

will face the ax, politics could prove to be a major deterrent,

especially if Congress has anything to say about it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least a dozen members of Congress--including Michigan Rep.

John Conyers, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary

Committee--have threatened to introduce legislation that would

revoke Major League Baseball's unique antitrust exemption, which

allows owners to control movement of teams from one city to the

next. Minnesota Sens. Paul Wellstone (D) and Mark Dayton (D)

already have sponsored such a bill, hoping to use it as leverage

to protect their hometown team, the Minnesota Twins, from

contraction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, several members of Virginia's congressional

delegation have jumped on the bandwagon, too-but for entirely

different reasons. Late last month, Virginia Sens. George Allen

(R) and John Warner (R) and Reps. Frank Wolf (R), Tom Davis (R)

and Jim Moran (D) hinted in a letter to baseball commissioner

Bud Selig that they, too, would take a second look at the

league's antitrust exemption should he not support Northern

Virginia's bid for a major league franchise. Last week, Davis,

who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee (the

House GOP's chief fund-raising arm), told reporters that he

would do what it takes to keep the Minnesota Twins from

folding--so that the team ultimately could be moved to Virginia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, none of these threats are new. For years, Congress

has debated legislation that would roll back the 1922 law that

shields Major League Baseball from most antitrust rules, and for

years, the league has blocked such bills. The only exception: a

1998 law signed by President Clinton that removed the league's

antitrust exemption on labor disputes with players. Since then,

Major League Baseball has upped its lobbyist payroll in

Washington to more than $1 million annually, according to

disclosure reports filed with the Senate. That's more than

double what the other professional sports leagues--the National

Basketball Association, the National Football League and the

National Hockey League--spend annually inside the Beltway,

combined. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like other industries, Major League Baseball also supplants its

lobbying with campaign contributions, having doled out $70,000

in soft money contributions during the first six months of 2001,

two-thirds to Democrats. That's just a few thousand dollars more

than the league and its employees contributed during the entire

1999-2000 election cycle alone--not including the $100,000 the

league contributed to the Bush-Cheney Inaugural Fund late last

year. Adding to that arsenal, Major League Baseball recently

filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to open its

own political action committee-the first major sports league to

operate its own PAC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the league's biggest influence in Washington may not come

via the commissioner's office or through its well-connected

roster of lobbyists--which includes Lucy Calautti, wife of Sen.

Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). Instead, baseball's real pull may come

from the individual teams' front offices, where some of the

nation's biggest political contributors call the shots.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, Carl Lindner, top banana at Chiquita (and the

American Financial Group) and the sixth biggest individual

campaign contributor during the 2000 elections, owns the

Cincinnati Reds. Attorney Peter Angelos, No. 8 on the list of

biggest givers, owns the Baltimore Orioles, and William O.

DeWitt, one of President Bush's top fund-raisers during the last

campaign and co-chairman of Reynolds, DeWitt &amp; Co, is the man

behind the St. Louis Cardinals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All told, Major League Baseball teams and their owners

contributed more than $3.9 million in soft money &amp; individual

contributions during the 1999-2000 election cycle, 60 percent to

Democrats. (Of that total, more than $75,000 was contributed to

President Bush.) That doesn't include contributions made by the

corporate owners of Major League Baseball teams, including

Atlanta Braves owner AOL Time Warner and the Walt Disney Co,

which reportedly hopes to unload its Anaheim Angels via the

planned contraction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With those kind of political connections, team owners are hoping

to keep Congress and President Bush--a former owner of the Texas

Rangers--out of the mix when it comes to the future of Major

League Baseball. But that lobbying already is being countered by

the Major League Baseball Players Association-which has asked

Bush to block the planned contraction-and other well-connected

political donors like Fred Malek ($60,457 during 1999-2000; 96

percent to Republicans). Malek, who heads a group wanting to

bring baseball to Washington, was partners with George W. Bush

in the ownership of the Texas Rangers and was former President

George H.W. Bush's campaign manager in 1992. </font></p>
