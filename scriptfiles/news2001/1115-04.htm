<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WASHINGTON - November 15 - The U.S. House of Representatives is preparing to vote today on a resolution encouraging public schools to set aside prayer time for students.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United for Separation of Church and State said the non-binding resolution, H.Con.Res. 239, is unnecessary and recklessly encourages school officials to ignore constitutional law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a Christian minister, I believe in prayer, but it's not the job of Congress to tell our children when and how to pray,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;Parents, not politicians, have the responsibility to instruct our children about matters of faith.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The measure was introduced by Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.), a freshman lawmaker with strong ties to the Religious Right. The resolution expresses the &quot;sense of Congress that schools in the United States should set aside a sufficient period of time to allow children to pray for, or quietly reflect on behalf of, the Nation during this time of struggle against the forces of international terrorism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU's Lynn said the resolution ignores the American principle of church-state separation. The measure not only promotes school prayer, he noted, but even instructs students what topic they should pray about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In some countries,&quot; Lynn said, &quot;the government tells people when and how to pray. I wish Congress understood that in America, individuals make religious decisions for themselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If this resolution passes, public school officials should ignore the House's advice,&quot; added Lynn. &quot;For decades, federal courts have mandated that the state not promote prayer in schools. With that in mind, schools that act on this resolution may find themselves in court.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn noted this is the second time in less than a month that the House has devoted time to endorsing non-binding measures regarding religion in public schools. On Oct. 17, House members voted unanimously to endorse a resolution expressing support for the display of the words &quot;God Bless America&quot; in the nation's public schools.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At this time of national crisis, the last thing we need is political bickering over prayer and religion,&quot; Lynn concluded. &quot;This resolution invites divisiveness when we are striving for unity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The non-binding resolution expresses only the &quot;sense of the Congress,&quot; and if passed, would not force schools to set aside time for prayer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., which has led the opposition to congressional attempts to require government-sponsored prayer in public schools. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
