- April 12 - With a chilling move that seems to signal a new government

willingness to abridge privacy rights and interfere with access to

even the most widely accepted forms of birth control, President

Bush has stunned women and individual rights advocates across the

nation. His budget proposal to stop requiring health insurers to

provide government employees with a full range of contraceptive

options could sharply limit access to birth control, and not only

for millions of women employed by the government. It could also

pave the way for a similar rollback among private sector employers.

<p>"If there was any shred of doubt that the radical right is

calling the shots in the White House, this action dispels them,"

said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way. "The

far right wants to turn back the clock to the days not only before

legal and safe abortion but even before birth control pills, which

they claim are a kind of abortion. This action by President Bush is

the first major and dangerous step down that road."

<p>Opposition to contraceptive methods such as IUDs and birth

control pills is a long-held ultra-right tenet. This issue arose

during the confirmation battle over Attorney General John Ashcroft

because of his avid advocacy as a U.S. Senator of both a

constitutional amendment and federal legislation so extreme that

they would have banned IUDs and birth control pills as well as

abortions.

<p>Ashcroft's advocacy as a senator also included attempts to limit

women's access to birth control. In 1998, he was one of just eight

senators, including Jesse Helms and Bob Smith, who signed a letter

opposing pending legislation to require federal employee health

insurance plans to cover the cost of prescription contraceptives.

The letter states: "we are concerned with what appears to be a

loophole in the legislation regarding contraceptives that upon

failing to prevent fertilization, act de facto as abortifacients.

Therefore we believe this amendment is a precedent setting attempt

to mandate coverage of other abortifacients." Ashcroft and the

other letter-signers urged that the provision requiring coverage of

contraceptives be dropped. By building a birth control exception

into the proposed budget, the White House is taking a major step

toward the extreme policy that the far right tried and failed to

institute just three years ago.

<p>"Now that we have far right advocates like John Ashcroft shaping

the nation's policy, we can see that the 'compassionate

conservative' badge that George W. Bush wore so proudly as a

campaigner was no more real than the emperor's clothes," said Neas.
