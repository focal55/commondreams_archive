<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- August 29 -  The Sierra Club announced today that it will run newspaper ads

in four states and Washington, DC, calling on Representatives to pass real

campaign finance reform legislation, for cleaner elections and a cleaner

environment.  When Congress returns from its summer vacation next week,

Representatives will have a chance to bring the Shays-Meehan campaign

finance reform bill to the floor of the House for a fair and open debate.

In July, the House leadership thwarted efforts to bring the bill to the

House floor, trapping it in the House Rules Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans don't want to see our clean air or drinking water safeguards

sold to the highest bidder,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the

Sierra Club.  &quot;The Senate took the first step to stop the flow of

polluters' cash into campaign coffers.  Now, the House must step up to the

plate to give elections back to all Americans, not just the wealthy

corporate polluters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 205 Representatives already signed onto the discharge petition to get

the Shays-Meehan bill out of the House Rules Committee, only 13 more

Representatives are needed to bring the Shays-Meehan to House floor.  The

ads, which run August 29, urge readers to call Reps. Doug Ose (R-CA),

Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD) and John Thune (R-SD)

and ask them to release the bill and allow it to be debated and voted on

before the full House.  The ad will also run in Washington, DC in early

September.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Elected officials should answer to people in their districts, not to the

oil, mining, chemical and timber industries that buy undue influence with

campaign dollars,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;We urge these Representatives, whose

constituents care deeply about cleaning up elections, to work for real

campaign finance reform and vote to bring the Shays-Meehan bill to the

floor of the House.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like the companion McCain-Feingold bill in the Senate, the Shays-Meehan

bill bans soft money -- unregulated contributions given to political

parties -- and is an important first step in reforming our campaign system

by taking huge, unlimited and unreported donations out of the campaign

system.  This means that polluting industries will no longer be permitted

to dump unlimited amounts of money into campaigns in an attempt to gain

undue influence.  The Senate passed the McCain-Feingold measure on April 2

by a vote of 59-41.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The oil and gas industry handed out more $32 million to candidates in the

2000 elections alone; now the Congress and President Bush want to open the

pristine and irreplaceable Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil

exploration.  The automobile mobile industry donated almost $18 million to

candidates and parties in 1999-2000; Congress then voted against raising

miles per gallon standards on sport utility vehicles. The mining industry

spent more than $6 million dollars on campaign payments; just months after

taking office President Bush rejected a plan to remove arsenic from our

drinking water.</font></p>
