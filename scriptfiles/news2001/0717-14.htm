- July 17 -  The Brady Campaign to

Prevent Gun Violence has released a short "e-movie" geared toward

motivating supporters of common-sense gun laws to take action. The

computer movie, a "Flash video" that is sent via e-mail, is a

metaphor for the stranglehold that the U.S. gun lobby has over the

Bush Administration. The video can be viewed at:

<p>"The gun lobby will continue to hold our government hostage

unless we mobilize and build an army of supporters to counter

them," said Michael D. Barnes, President of the Brady Campaign. "I

urge all Americans to take two minutes to watch this humorous,

animated e-movie from the Brady Campaign, which sends a serious

message: we must work together to take back our country."

<p>Supporters who have viewed the video have responded extremely

favorably. "It's amusing and informative," said one. "It's nice

to see you've got a sense of humor," said another. "It's hip,

humorous and educational," said a third.

Eye on Ashcroft and the Bush Administration: (Time-Line of Bush

Administration Anti-Gun Control Actions)

<p>May 2001:

Attorney General John Ashcroft writes a letter to the National

Rifle Association endorsing the NRA's long-discredited view of the

Second Amendment.

<p>Interior Secretary Gale Norton speaks at the NRA convention.

<p>June 2001:

Ashcroft sides with the NRA and proposes to destroy critical

background check records just one day after a gun is sold, despite

the FBI assertions that records should be retained for at least 90

days to ensure the integrity of the background check system.

<p>July 2001:

<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton advances the NRA's

position when he tells a United Nations conference that its

sensible proposals were a threat to legal gun ownership.

<p>Attorney General Ashcroft directs the U.S. Justice Department to

reverse its long-standing position on the Second Amendment -- a

position that Republican and Democratic Administrations have held

for more than 30 years.
