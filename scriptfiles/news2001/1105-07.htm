<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 5 - Citizen advocates 

converged today in Washington, D.C. to call on President Bush and 

Congress to end the outburst of wartime opportunism since the 

September 11 tragedy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since September 11 members of Congress have served up a nonstop 

buffet of corporate pork legislation. Under the guise of 'national 

security' our federal treasury is being raided and democratic 

rights are being taken away while Congress feeds sympathetic 

campaign contributors at taxpayer expense, sends working people to 

fight, and leaves the unemployed, disenfranchised, and American 

families to suffer,&quot; said Ralph Nader, consumer advocate and 

Citizen Works founder. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organizations in the environmental, labor, consumer, civil 

liberties, civil rights and pro-democracy communities have had to 

defend citizens against a new onslaught of opportunism in areas 

ranging from multi-billion dollar corporate tax cuts to expansion 

of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For corporations to loot the U.S. Treasury and prey on the 

environment while wrapping themselves in the flag is an act of 

sheer treachery, one Americans will not soon forget,&quot; said John 

Passacantando, executive director of Greenpeace USA. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth stated 

that, &quot;The Administration and many in Congress are pushing energy 

legislation that will actually weaken national security.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mildred Brown, past national president of ACORN said, &quot;The 

nation recognizes that the heroes of this tragedy are our nation's 

working people, but all Congress and the President want to do is 

give more tax breaks to big business and the nation's wealthiest 

people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizen Works, a pro-democracy citizen organization, laid out 

nine areas of corporate opportunism in a call to action released 

today: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. A so-called &quot;Economic Stimulus&quot; Plan that benefits corporate 

treasuries and neglects workers <br>

2. Pharmaceutical Gouging <br>

3. &quot;Bailouts for Billionaires&quot; not workers <br>

4. The Re-emergence of autocratic &quot;Fast Track&quot; <br>

5. Handouts for the Insurance Industry <br>

6. More Phony &quot;Defense&quot; and the Reintroduction of Biological 

Weapons <br>

7. Endangering the Environment and Energy <br>

8. The oxymoronic &quot;USA PATRIOT Act&quot; <br>

9. Restrictions on Information/Invasions of Privacy </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;From Fast Track to pharmaceuticals, wartime opportunists are 

shamefully using the September 11 tragedy to advance narrow 

corporate interests at the expense of public health and safety,&quot; 

said Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential Action. </font></p>
