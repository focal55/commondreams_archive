<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEXICO CITY - September 27 -  Genetically engineered corn imported to Mexico from the U.S. has contaminated a global center of biological diversity for corn. The Mexican government has confirmed that corn varieties from 15 communities in the state of Oaxaca have suffered ontamination of 3 to 10 percent. Greenpeace is calling on Mexico to adopt emergency measures to combat this first known example of genetic contamination of a place of origin and diversity for a crop grown around the world as a staple food. In addition, Greenpeace has called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to stop reregistration of genetically engineered Bt corn. This type of engineered corn is responsible for the contamination in Mexico and is currently up for reregistration in the U.S. on October 15. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The U.S. has a moral obligation to stop sending GE corn to Mexico, a major world center of diversity,&#148; said Ama Marston, Greenpeace genetic engineering campaigner. &#147;As the steward of this corn diversity, Mexico should immediately begin testing U.S. corn imports to be sure they are free of genetic contamination.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace urged the Mexican government to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem and to eliminate the source of contamination by banning all GE and GE-contaminated corn imports to the country. While the Mexican government has confirmed the contamination in at least 15 communities in Central Mexico, it has taken no action to eliminate the source or to implement any emergency measures to control the damage to the environment and the food chain. Greenpeace also appealed to the governments participating in next week&#146;s meeting on the Biosafety Protocol in Nairobi, Kenya, to assist Mexico in protecting one of the world&#146;s most important food crops as well as to speed up the ratification and implementation of the protocol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#148;The world is at risk of losing unique diversity of corn to genetic pollution,&#148; said Raul Benet, Executive Director of Greenpeace Mexico. &#147;This diversity ensures global food security now and in the future. As Jack Harlan the pioneering American botanist and plant breeder has stated, genetic diversity &#145;stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we cannot imagine.&#146;&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1970, the lack of diversity within the U.S. corn crop lead to the loss of 15 percent of the country&#146;s corn harvest, worth approximately $1 billion at the time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even a low level of genetic contamination is highly significant in a center of diversity and origin. The contamination is likely to spread through pollen flow and affect other traditional varieties and wild relatives growing in the area. Crop diversity is essential in the continuing pursuit of food crop varieties resistant to new pests, diseases, and changing climatic and environmental conditions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The international community must now agree on immediate preventative measures to avoid further outbreaks of contamination into other centers of diversity by banning all imports and releases of genetically modified organisms into these areas,&#148; said Dr. Doreen Stabinsky, Greenpeace science advisor. </font></p>
