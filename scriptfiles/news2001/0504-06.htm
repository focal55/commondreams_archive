- May 4 -  The following is a

statement by Kathryn S. Fuller, president of World Wildlife

Fund-U.S., on today's decision by the Bush Administration to

re-open the rule-making process on the Roadless Area

Conservation Rule:

<p>"Today's decision by the Bush Administration to reopen the

rule-making process on the Roadless Area Conservation Rule, and

thus rehash the past decade's rancorous debates over national

forest policy, is a disappointing step backward.

<p>"While ostensibly leaving in place the policy that protects

the last intact 30 percent of our national forests, the

Administration plans to amend the rule to provide logging and

oil and gas companies more influence at the local level in the

management of roadless areas in national forests. This signals

a return to the days before the roadless policy was promulgated,

when local officials, extractive industries and

environmentalists battled each other on every national forest,

paralyzing the U.S. Forest Service, interfering with the orderly

management of natural resources, and, more often than not,

opening up more and more pristine forests to the axe and the

bulldozer.

<p>"The Roadless Area Conservation Rule is a carefully wrought

compromise. It provides protection for some intact forests,

limits (but does not eliminate) road building, logging and oil

and gas exploration within them, and leaves over half the

national forest land in the country open to roading and

extractive industry. The rule was the result of ten years of

study and dialogue, 600 public meetings across the country, and

benefited from the input of 1.6 million Americans, the greatest

number of comments ever received by the Federal government in

response to a proposed rule. The comments were over 95 percent

in favor. Today's decision to reevaluate roadless area

protection on each national forest sweeps all that aside,

disregarding years of hard work and the concerns of millions of

Americans.

<p>"Roadless areas in our national forests provide refuge for

wildlife, reservoirs for plant life, and protect the freshwater

supplies of local communities. They are vital resources that

must be protected. On behalf of WWF's 1.2 million members in

the U.S., I urge President Bush to reconsider this decision and

implement the Roadless Area Conservation Rule as it now stands."
