<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 28 - <i>&quot;RAISE THE FLOOR sends a clear message to America that the minimum wage 

should lift people out of poverty, not perpetuate it. That's been our history 

and we should rediscover it.&quot;   </i>--Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;RAISE THE FLOOR: Wages and Policies That Work for All of Us,&quot; a 

groundbreaking new book published by the Ms. Foundation for Women, deftly 

blends the latest data and real-life stories to illustrate how an annual 

minimum wage income of $10,712 a year just doesn't add up. It shows what it 

takes to make ends meet in today's America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A mom and dad with two children would have to work a combined 3.3 full-time 

minimum wage jobs to make ends meet. That's 132 hours a week. Minimum wage 

workers earn 35 percent less than their counterparts did in 1968--adjusting 

for inflation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;People work hard full time, year round, and yet their families go without,&quot; 

says Marie C. Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation and author of the 

book's afterword. &quot;They take care of our children and seniors. They care for 

us in hospitals and harvest our food. Our country depends upon their hard 

work. Yet they can't buy adequate housing, health care and food. Surely we, 

the richest of nations, can do better.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most Americans believe a job should keep you out of poverty, not keep you in 

it. &quot;Raise The Floor&quot; authors Holly Sklar, Laryssa Mykyta and Susan Wefald 

show us how we can translate that belief into reality.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Raise The Floor&quot; recommends raising the minimum wage to $8. That's what a 

single worker needs to meet their minimum needs working full time. That's 

what it takes just to match the minimum wage of 1968, adjusting for 

inflation. &quot;Raise The Floor&quot; spotlights businesses, large and small, that 

demonstrate how good wages are good business.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I've been in the restaurant business for almost 30 years and know firsthand 

how raising entry-level wages is good for business as well as workers, &quot; says 

Judy Wicks, owner of the White Dog Caf&eacute; in Philadelphia. &quot;RAISE THE FLOOR 

cuts through the myths and shows us how we can solve some of our biggest 

problems.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To assure that all working families can meet their basic needs, &quot;Raise The 

Floor&quot; explains how we can supplement a higher minimum wage with improved 

child care, health care, housing and Earned Income Tax Credit policies, and 

other practical solutions.</font></p>
