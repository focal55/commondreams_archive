- June 21 - The Justice Department&#146;s move to settle the federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry represents the latest in the Bush administration&#146;s actions that prioritize corporate profit over human health and the public interest, according to activists with the corporate accountability organization Infact.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fate of this lawsuit has been in question since the day John Ashcroft was appointed US Attorney General. As a Missouri Senator, John Ashcroft had an extensive track record of tobacco-friendly maneuvers, including casting the sole dissenting vote in a 1998 Senate committee decision to approve debate on a tobacco settlement bill. Ashcroft vowed to employ every possible obstructionist technique-including filibuster-to kill the bill, which was later defeated on the Senate floor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ties between the current administration and tobacco peddlers extend beyond Attorney General Ashcroft&#146;s sympathetic ear to Big Tobacco&#146;s lobbying efforts and the $8 million tobacco corporations donated in the last elections:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the election cycle, a DC-based Philip Morris lobbyist, Charles Black, served as an informal advisor to Mr. Bush.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current White House liaison to the business community is Kirk Blalock, former Philip Morris public relations official.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush&#146;s Senior Advisor, Karl Rove, is keeping a high profile about his role in shaping this administration&#146;s policies. From 1991 to 1996 Rove served as a political consultant for Philip Morris.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Entrusted with improving the nation&#146;s health, evidence exists that Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson not only had overseas trips bankrolled by Philip Morris while acting as Governor of Wisconsin, but also had a senior Philip Morris vice president featured among the top thirty most frequently called individuals and organizations from his gubernatorial office. </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Revelations such as these could soon become more publicly pronounced given the recent passage of a resolution by the World Health Assembly urging countries to make transparent any connections between national delegates and the tobacco industry. With Thompson representing the US in an important global tobacco control treaty process, our administration is placed in the potentially embarrassing position of having to reveal Thompson&#146;s ties to Philip Morris.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;With advisors and cabinet members so thoroughly connected to the Marlboro Man, it is no wonder that the Bush administration is already formulating its exit strategy regarding the Justice Department&#146;s lawsuit against Big Tobacco,&#148; says Infact Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey.</font></p>
