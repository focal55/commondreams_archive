- January 22 - &quot;Just two days into his term, President Bush has trashed any remaining

trace of the moderate mask he wore during the campaign,&quot; said NOW President

Patricia Ireland. &quot;Bush's announcement that he will sign an executive order

ending funding to international family planning organizations is a direct

threat to the health and lives of women around the globe and an ominous

sign of what is to come.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With the vote on confirmation of Sen. John Ashcroft scheduled in the U.S.

Senate tomorrow, this executive order may have the effect of further

mobilizing women's rights supporters,&quot; said Ireland. &quot;Bush has said he will

do everything in his power to end abortions; the only way to stop him is to

organize the vast majority in this country who believes abortion should

remain safe, legal and accessible.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal funding for abortion and abortion-related activities has been

illegal since 1973 with the passage of the Helms Amendment to the

International Assistance Act, but this order would take monies away from

educational programs in some of the most underfunded areas in the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;An end to funding in countries where there is a dire need for education

and pregnancy prevention will only lead to more unplanned pregnancies, more

abortions, greater risk to women and greater economic need in the future,&quot;

stated Ireland. &quot;With such policies set internationally, we know our own

rights are also threatened?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This kind of order was not unexpected on this, the anniversary of Roe v.

Wade. Bush has made his anti-abortion stance well known, from his personal

statements to the selection of abortion opponents Sen. John Ashcroft for

attorney general and Gov. Tommy Thompson for secretary of health and human

services.&quot; said Ireland. &quot;Promises of bi-partisanship seem a myth as some

of women's most basic rights are in jeopardy. Our job now is to prevent a

reversal of the hard fought battles for women's rights to their own bodies.&quot; </font></p>
