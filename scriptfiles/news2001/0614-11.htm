- June 14 - Children who watch less TV want fewer toys, reports a new study

published in the June issue of the Journal of Developmental and

Behavioral Pediatrics.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study documented the effects of a school-based effort to reduce

television, video game and video tape use among third- and

fourth-graders upon those children's requests for toy purchases.  It

found that by the end of the school year, among those students who

encouraged to watch less TV, &quot;the odds of a child requesting a toy

purchase in the prior week was about 70% lower...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study concludes that &quot;reducing television viewing is a promising

approach to reducing the influences of advertising on children's

behavior.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If you want your kids to stop nagging you for toys, then put the TV set

in the closet or get rid of it altogether,&quot; said Gary Ruskin, executive

director of Commercial Alert.  &quot;The study just confirms what Economics

101 tells us: that advertising works, especially on vulnerable and

impressionable children.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Kids are mimics.  What they see on TV is what they want to have and

what they want to be,&quot; Ruskin said. &quot;Advertisers know this.  Programmers

know this.  It's time for the politicians in our country to wake up to

it, and defend children from commercial manipulation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study notes that &quot;On average, the number of commercials a child sees

has increased from 20,000 per year in the 1970s to about 40,000

commercials per year today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lead author of the study is Thomas N. Robinson M.D., M.P.H. of the

Stanford University School of Medicine.  A PDF version of the study is

available at: &lt;<a href="http://www.commercialalert.org/television/Toytv.pdf">http://www.commercialalert.org/television/Toytv.pdf</a>&gt;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding toddlers, in 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics released

a statement on &quot;Media Education&quot; that &quot;Pediatricians should urge parents

to avoid television viewing for children under the age of 2 years.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader founded Commercial Alert in 1998 to keep the commercial

culture within its proper sphere, and to prevent it from exploiting

children and subverting the higher values of family, community,

environmental integrity and democracy.  For more information, see
