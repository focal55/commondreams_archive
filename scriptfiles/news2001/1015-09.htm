<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 15 - Envelopes containing threatening letters and an unidentified powdery substance have been received by Planned Parenthood Federation of America offices in Washington, D.C., as well as by affiliate offices and health centers throughout the country. As of 2 p.m. today, that includes 90 clinics and offices in at least 13 states. There have been no reported injuries. Law enforcement officials are now conducting tests on the powder to learn if it is anthrax. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is perverse that these individuals here at home, who are themselves terrorists by virtue of their actions, would seek to capitalize on the events of the last days and weeks to further their own extremist agenda. But this will not deter us from our mission of providing essential health services to women in this nation,&quot; stated Gloria Feldt, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. &quot;Whether a hoax or not, these are intolerable acts of terror, and every effort must be made to apprehend the perpetrators.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the letters included messages from the &quot;Army of God&quot;, a domestic terrorist group that has claimed responsibility for attacks on reproductive healthcare providers. The envelopes, mailed to affiliates on the east coast and Midwest, had pre-printed return addresses from the U.S. Marshall's Office and the Secret Service. Some have an embossed message that reads, &quot;Time Sensitive - Urgent Security Notice - Open Immediately.&quot; The letters were mailed from Columbus, OH; Atlanta, GA; Chattanooga and Knoxville, TN. At an affiliate in Greensboro, N.C., an initial field test on the grainy substance has come back negative. Authorities are testing the powder from all sites. Planned Parenthood will provide the results as soon as possible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Law enforcement and HazMat teams have responded and are aiding in the investigations. All precautionary measures have been taken to ensure employee and patient safety. </font></p>

Representatives of Planned Parenthood are available for interviews by phoning the above listed number.</font></p>
