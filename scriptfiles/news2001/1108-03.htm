- November 8 - The Sierra Club, the State Building and Construction Trades

Council of California of AFL-CIO, the National Economic Development &amp; Law

Center, and the Office of the Mayor of Richmond celebrated a judge's

decision yesterday that overturned an executive order banning the use of

Project Labor Agreements that fund major construction projects.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club and National Economic Development and Law Council,

represented pro bono by Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes &amp; Lerach, filed an

amicus brief to a lawsuit put forth by the City of Richmond and Building

and Construction Trades Department in Washington, DC. The lawsuit

challenged a Bush Administration Executive Order (13202) issued on February

22, 2001 that barred federal agencies from using project labor agreements

(PLAs) on major construction projects. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan issued an

order Wednesday holding that the Executive Order was unconstitutional in

that Bush exceeded his authority to issue the order and because the subject

matter of the order was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club is delighted with the federal court's ruling supporting

the use of Project Labor Agreements,&quot; said Tim Frank, chair of the Sierra

Club Challenge to Sprawl Committee. &quot;If we want our cities to thrive, we

need to clean them up and bring in quality development. Project Labor

Agreements assure quality environmental clean-up projects.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club and State Building Trades pointed out that by facilitating

the coordinated use of skilled labor on complex projects, Project Labor

Agreements reduce cost, save time and increase the quality of the work

done. This is essential in environmental clean-up projects. The superior

environmental training of workers and the reduced time and cost all help

make it possible for communities to clean up toxic sites and redevelop

blighted areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One project that was affected by the original Executive Order was the

Richmond Transit Village. This housing development would provide increased

transportation options to thousands of Richmond residents, limit suburban

sprawl, reduce the number of cars on the road, and decrease air pollution.
