- May 16 - The Sierra Club today expressed disappointment with the U.S. House of Representatives for upholding the "global gag rule" policy that

limits international family planning.  The House approved an amendment to

the Foreign Relations Authorization Act (H.R. 1646) to maintain the global

gag rule, which restricts U.S. funding for family planning programs all over the world and puts more pressure on our global natural resources.

This amendment, introduced by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), passed by a

vote of 218 to 210.

<p>

"Global population growth coupled with wasteful consumption is having dire

consequences on our environment," said Carl Pope, executive director of the

Sierra Club.  "The rate at which we are consuming natural resources is

jeopardizing the health of the planet and threatening the availability of

our safe water, healthy forests and clean air for generations that follow.

Instead of working to protect our environment and families worldwide, the

House has restricted international family planning aid, which is crucial to

slowing population growth and easing the strain on our natural resources."

<p>

<p>

The global gag rule disqualifies overseas family planning organizations from receiving U.S. funds if they, with their own money, lobby to change

abortion laws or provide legal abortion services in their countries.  It

has been proven that women who have access to, and information about,

reproductive health care and family planning are better able to protect their health, the health of their families and the health of the earth.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

President Bush reinstated the global gag rule just days after his

inauguration.  The global gag rule is out of step with the vast majority of

Americans who support family planning opportunities worldwide and want to

protect the global environment.   By limiting access to information and services that help families to decide the timing and spacing of their

children, President Bush has made it more difficult to protect our natural

resources that are under pressure from the demands of rapidly increasing

population.

<p>

<p>

<p><i>

The Sierra Club, America's oldest grassroots environmental organization, is

actively working to address the connections between population, environment

and natural resources by promoting international and domestic family

planning assistance.  We support voluntary, unrestricted, comprehensive family planning programs to foster a balance between global population and

natural resources.  We are working to reduce wasteful consumption to

protect the global environment and preserve natural resources for our

common future. </i>
