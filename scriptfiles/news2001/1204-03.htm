<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - December 4 - A study of a large, nationally representative sample of older Americans, to be published Dec. 4 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, has found that 43 percent of those people without prescription drug coverage who are of minority ethnicity, have annual incomes of less than $10,000 and have out-of-pocket prescription drug costs of more than $100 per month reported restricting their use of prescribed medicines.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was conducted by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, Department of Medicine, who collected information from a random sample of almost 5,000 Americans, 70 or older, with and without drug coverage, who regularly used prescription medicines. Even one of three risk factors -- ethnicity, income and out-of-pocket drug costs of more than $100 a month -- made it significantly more likely that people without prescription drug coverage would be forced to restrict their use of medications due to cost.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the study, 20.9 percent of minority subjects, 15.6 percent of those with annual incomes under $10,000 and 13.4 percent of those with out-of-pocket prescription drug costs of more than $100 per month experienced medication restriction due to cost. Looked at from a different perspective, low-income study participants lacking prescription drug insurance were about 15 times more likely to limit their use of prescription drugs than low-income participants with full coverage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, in the absence of a prescription drug benefit, some of the country's most vulnerable seniors are most likely to go without the medicines they may need to maintain their health. The study&#146;s authors note that previous studies have shown that &quot;policies designed to limit medication use may have serious consequences for patients&#146; health, resulting in increased emergency department visits, nursing home admissions, [and] use of emergency mental health services.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These findings bring to the fore the idea that when you judge societies by how they treat their most vulnerable members, the United States ranks very low,&quot; said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Health Research Group. &quot;Our country fails to provide health insurance for about one-seventh of our population and fails to provide prescription drug coverage for millions of Medicare-covered older Americans who cannot afford to purchase drug coverage on their own.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of the study are consistent with a Nov. 20 Harris Poll of a random sample of 1,010 adult Americans that found 39 percent of people with annual incomes of less than $15,000 a year had not filled a prescription for medicine in the previous 12 months.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Michael Steinman, the lead author of the study, works in the Department of Medicine, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and at the University of California, San Francisco.</font></p>
