- April 17 - Making an appeal to The Coca-Cola Company's board of directors, an environmental group released today a letter signed by a diverse coalition of leaders urging support for setting recycling goals and developing a plan to meet them.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Investors, public officials, businesses, environmental and community leaders share a common objective, which is halting the wasting of Coke bottles and cans,&quot; said Bill Sheehan, national network coordinator for the Athens, Georgia-based GrassRoots Recycling Network. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Shareholders can send the Coke board of directors a clear message by voting for Item 5, the recycling resolution, at the April 18 annual shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Delaware,&quot; Sheehan said.  &quot;For information on the resolution visit our Internet web site at www.grrn.org.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Domini Social Investments, based in New York, explained why it is co-sponsoring the Coca-Cola shareholder resolution. &quot;In our view, a firm's commitment to responsible management of its waste stream is an essential component of sound corporate management, and a strong contributor to shareholder value. As the industry leader, we believe Coke has a responsibility to develop a more comprehensive recycling policy with clear goals that raise the bar for the beverage industry,&quot; said Adam Kanzer, general counsel for Domini Social Investments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shareholder groups have been discussing recycling concerns with Coca-Cola management for two years.  The recycling resolution calls upon the company to achieve specific recycling targets by January 1, 2005: using 25 percent recycled plastic to make new bottles and reaching an 80 percent national recycling rate for bottles and cans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are encouraged by Coke's responsiveness to our concerns, and hope that shareholders will take this opportunity to send management a further message of encouragement by voting to support our resolution,&quot; Kanzer said.  &quot;We hold 717,300 shares of the Coca-Cola Company in the Domini Social Equity Fund's (Ticker: DSEFX) socially and environmentally screened portfolio.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pat Franklin, executive director of the Arlington, Virginia-based Container Recycling Institute said,  &quot;In the 24 hours from releasing this appeal to Coca-Cola's board of directors to the vote at the shareholders meeting tomorrow, more than 54 million empty Coke soft drink bottles and cans will be thrown away. It's a terrible waste of precious natural resources and the energy needed to make more plastic and aluminum beverage containers.&quot; </font></p>
