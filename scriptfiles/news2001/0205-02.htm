- February 5 - The Aviation Consumer

Action Project called on Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta

to act on short term proposals to ease the airline delays, which a

U.S. DOT Inspector General's report last week found had increased

in 2000 by 20 percent, on top of a 35 percent increase in 1999.

One in four flights is now delayed an average of an hour, while

flight cancellations that usually result in 2 to 12 hour delays

have soared to one in thirty.

<p>Paul Hudson, Executive Director, said, "California style

blackouts in air travel are now possible unless Secretary Mineta

moves quickly. Pending short term solutions are sitting on his

desk and have been on FAA Administrator's Jane Garvey's desk for

over 18 months. The Bush Administration must not continue the

Clinton Administration policy of delaying about delays."

<p>Since 1998, ACAP's executive director has met several times with

FAA Administrator Jane Garvey on the delay problem. In August

2000, ACAP and a host of other aviation consumer representatives

met at U.S. DOT headquarters for an "Airline Delay Summit" and

with then U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Rodney

Slater, who heard specific proposals to ease the delay crisis. But

no action was taken, and the problem has only worsened to become a

crisis.

<p>Pending consumer group proposals include a Truth in Scheduling

Rule, requiring airlines to notify passengers of the on time

statistic of chronically delayed flights and to eliminate

deceptively scheduled flights (i.e. those late or canceled more

than 80 percent of the time), thereby arming passengers with

accurate scheduling information. This rule would eliminate the

incentive airlines now have to over schedule flights during peak

times to attract more customers. ACAP estimates that issuance of

the pending Truth in Scheduling Rule by U.S. DOT would reduce the

number of flights delays by 5 percent within 30 days, at no

significant cost to industry and would save the public with over $3

billion per year by reducing one type of unnecessary flight delay.

<p>Paul Hudson noted, "If the weather forecast says there is an 80

percent chance of rain, most people will not plan a picnic.

Likewise if the public is accurately informed when flights will

really take off and land, they will naturally adjust their travel

plans and tend to choose flights that are reasonably on time,

thereby reducing consumer demand for deceptively scheduled flights

during overcrowded times. Many airlines admit to over scheduling

but justify the practice on competitive grounds and because there

is no rule against it."

<p>Other proposals include:

<p>-- mandating use of larger airplanes (300 to 500 passenger jets)

to reduce the number of flights and relieve congestion between

major metropolitan airports,

<p>-- requiring airlines to operate with minimum reserves of

airplanes and flight crews (most airlines now operate with plus 1

percent to minus 8 percent reserves, causing daily chronic delays

and cancellations, that become massive delays in cases of minor

disruption),

<p>-- congestion pricing at major airports,

<p>-- shared use of airport capacity in congested major metro

areas,

<p>-- greater use of regional jets (30 to 60 passengers) for direct

service between smaller and medium size cities avoiding

overburdened hubs and certain congested big city airports,

<p>-- greater use of dozens of under-utilized military and

ex-military air bases for civilian aviation,

<p>-- new airports for the most over-crowded areas, such as Chicago

and Atlanta.

<p>Hudson noted, "In our view, the current delay crisis would

largely dissipate with reasonable government leadership and some

rationale regulation. Most experts in industry, government and

consumer groups agree that more runways are needed at some airports

and that air traffic control needs further modernization, but these

are medium to long-term measures that will do nothing to stem the

current delay crisis for 3 to 10 years. We cannot wait for a

California style electric deregulation debacle in air travel before

taking action."

<p>"Airlines and airports have largely caused the current crisis

with revenue maximizing and cost reduction practices. In the second

half of the 1990's, U.S. airlines earned record profits each year,

while the cost of unnecessary delays was borne largely by the

public. Some in the airline industry would use the delay crisis to

further a long sought political goal of the major airlines: Taking

air traffic control away from the FAA and turning it over to a

private monopoly, and to divert public attention from airline

responsibility for flight delays. The Bush Administration must

reject airline trade association's (Air Transport Association

(ATA)) opposition to any restrictions on airlines' present

unfettered right to schedule flights anytime, anywhere, and

especially the indefensible practice of issuing knowingly deceptive

flight schedules to the public (known as over scheduling). No

solution to the delay crisis is possible without reasonable

government regulation and enforcement existing DOT regulations

against deceptive marketing practices."

<p>Air traffic has become over concentrated at a few airports at

certain times of the day. Of the 450 airports in the USA, the

bottom 390 control only 6 percent of the traffic, while the top 60

have 94 percent of the traffic and the top 20 control over half the

traffic. Despite 0.5 to 5 percent annual increases in the air

travel, the skies are still virtually empty over 80 percent of the

USA, while most smaller and medium size airports have ironically

seen traffic stagnate or even decline due to major airline hub and

spoke systems and higher airfares.

<p><i>The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) is an independent,

non-profit, public interest organization founded in 1971, supported

by thousands of air travelers, which acts as a voice and ear for

the traveling public on major aviation issues. ACAP has been a

voting member of the FAA's 65 member Aviation Rulemaking Advisory

Committee (ARAC) since 1991, and is the public representative on

ARAC's executive committee. ACAP receives no government or

aviation industry funding.
