- January 9 - The Pacifica Foundation, which in the summer of 1999 locked out 

the staff of KPFA Radio in Berkeley, Calif., has recently begun a similar 

series of actions at WBAI Radio, its New York City station. Management 

changed locks over Christmas weekend and fired and banned several targeted 

workers from the station. There have been a series of protests in New York. 

The following people are available for interviews:



<P><LI>BERNARD WHITE, <A HREF="mailto:burnardwhite@aol.com">burnardwhite@aol.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.savepacifica.net">www.savepacifica.net</A>

<BR>Longtime co-host of WBAI's "Wakeup Call" and program director for the 

station, White was fired without explanation two days before Christmas.



<P><LI>SHARAN HARPER, <A HREF="mailto:sharan@africana.com">sharan@africana.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.glib.com/pac_theft_menu.html">www.glib.com/pac_theft_menu.html</A>

<BR>Producer for WBAI's "Wakeup Call," Harper was also fired without 

explanation. Both she and White have been threatened with arrest if they 

attempt to enter the station. Their possessions have been impounded.



<P><LI>AMY GOODMAN, <A HREF="mailto:amyg@pacifica.org">amyg@pacifica.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.democracynow.org">www.democracynow.org</A>

<BR>Co-host of "Wakeup Call" and of "Democracy Now!," Pacifica's flagship 

program, Goodman is winner of numerous awards including the George Polk 

Award. She recently told the Associated Press: "Many people feel like 

there's a purging going on...and it is very frightening between the firings 

and the banning of people."



<P><LI>RAY LAFOREST, <A HREF="mailto:savewbai@hotmail.com">savewbai@hotmail.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wbai.org">www.wbai.org</A>

<BR>Laforest is on WBAI's Local Advisory Board (he is also director of Haitian 

Constituency USA and a labor organizer). He said today: "Pacifica has a 

history of representing the views of the communities that the listeners are 

a part of. We have seen a change in the structure of Pacifica resulting in 

it being more centralized, diminishing the voice of the local stations and 

local boards and eliminating the role of the listeners."



<P><LI>EDWARD HERMAN, <A HREF="mailto:hermane@wharton.upenn.edu">hermane@wharton.upenn.edu</A>,

<A HREF="http://www.zmag.org/CrisesCurEvts/Pacifica/wbai.htm">www.zmag.org/CrisesCurEvts/Pacifica/wbai.htm</A>

<BR>Economist and media analyst, author of "The Myth of the Liberal Media" and 

co-author (with Noam Chomsky) of "Manufacturing Consent," Herman said 

today: "The takeover of WBAI by the Pacifica Foundation is part of a 

continuing de-democratization of the radio network."



<P><LI>SAM HUSSEINI, <A HREF="mailto:samhusseini@yahoo.com">samhusseini@yahoo.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.wpfw.net">www.wpfw.net</A>

<BR>Chair of the WPFW (Pacifica's D.C. station) Local Advisory Board, Husseini 

said today: "Pacifica management has used censorship to hide from its 

listeners what it has done to the network."



<P><LI>ROB ROBINSON, <A HREF="mailto:robrobin@erols.com">robrobin@erols.com</A>, 

<A HREF="http://www.interweavers.com/berkeley/article.cfm?issue=09-21-00&storyID=1429">www.interweavers.com/berkeley/article.cfm?issue=09-21-00&storyID=1429</A>

One of two board members bringing suit against the majority of the Pacifica 

board, Robinson said today: "The Pacifica Foundation Governing Board's 

Executive Committee has engaged in a pattern of violations of the bylaws, 

has seized all decision-making power and refuses to be accountable to the 

listeners..."



<P><LI>DAVID ACOSTA, <A HREF="cpadga@aol.com">cpadga@aol.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.pacifica.org">www.pacifica.org</A>

<BR>While his term is under dispute, Acosta continues to serve as chair of the 

Pacifica Foundation board.
