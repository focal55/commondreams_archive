- December 10 - More than 3,500 civilians have been killed

in Afghanistan by U.S. bombs, according to a study to

be released December 10 by Marc W. Herold, Professor

of Economics, International Relations, and Women's

Studies at the University of New Hampshire. Professor

Herold will announce his findings on Monday, December

10 in a discussion with award-winning journalist, Amy

Goodman of Democracy Now! in Exile's War and Peace

Report (<a href="http://www.democracynow.org" target="_new">http://www.democracynow.org</a>). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professor Herold has been gathering data on civilian

casualties since October 7 by culling information from

news agencies, major newspapers, and first-hand

accounts. &quot;I decided to do the study because I

suspected that the modern weaponrywas not what it was

advertised to be. I was concerned that there would be

significant civilian casualties caused by the bombing,

and I was able to find some mention of casualties in

the foreign press but almost nothing in the U.S.

press,&quot; said Herold.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herold's data will be available at

<a href="http://pubpages.unh.edu/%7Emwherold/" target="_new">http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For each day since October 7, when the U.S. bombing of

Afghanistan began, he lists the number of casualties,

location, type of weapon used, and source(s) of

information. Following are several examples from his

daily calculations:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 11, two U.S. jets bombed the mountain

village of Karam, comprised of 60 mud houses, during

dinner and evening prayer time, killing 100-160

people. Sources: DAWN, (English language Pakistani

daily newspaper), the Guardian of London, the

Independent, International Herald Tribune, the

Scotsman, the Observer, and the BBC News.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 13, in the early morning, an F-18 dropped

2,000 lb. JDAM bombs on the Qila Meer Abas

neighborhood, 2 kms. South of the Kabul airport,

killing four people. Sources: Afghan Islamic Press,

Los Angeles Times, Frontier Post, Pakistan Observer,

the Guardian of London, and the BBC News.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 31, in a pre-dawn raid, an F-18 dropped a

2,000 lb. JDAM bomb on a Red Crescent clinic, killing

15 - 25 people. Sources: DAWN, the Times of London,

the Independent, the Guardian, Reuters, Associated

Press, and Agence France Presse.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Professor Herold has sought whenever possible to

cross-corroborate accounts of civilian casualties. He

relied upon British, Canadian, and Australian

newspapers; Indian newspapers, especially The Times of

India; three Pakistani daily newspapers; the Singapore

News; Afghan Islamic Press; Agence France Press;

Pakistan News Service; Reuters; BBC News Online; Al

Jazeera; and a variety of other reputable sources,

including the United Nations and other relief

agencies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon has repeatedly denied reports of civilian

casualties in Afghanistan, and most U.S. media outlets

have qualified their reports of casualties with the

statement &quot;could not be independently confirmed.&quot; But

Professor Herold has been able to confirm the number

of casualties and has found that the number is

climbing toward 4,000. &quot;People have to know that there

is a human cost to war, and that this is a war with

thousands of casualties,&quot; said Herold. &quot;These were

poor people to begin with, and, on top of that, they

had absolutely nothing to do with the events of

September 11.&quot;</font></p>
