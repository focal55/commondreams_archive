- June 7 - With a new Energy Department 

report on access to natural gas from public land in the Rocky 

Mountains, the Bush administration is launching an attack against 

reasonable protections for imperiled wildlife, Defenders of Wildlife 

warned today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In one of the administration's first acts to implement its 

national energy plan, the Department of Energy's report claims that 

two- thirds of the natural gas potential in the Greater Green River 

Basin of Wyoming and Colorado is closed to development or 

significantly restricted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That's just plain wrong,&quot; said Dr. Mark L. Shaffer, Defenders of 

Wildlife senior vice president for program. &quot;This biased report reads 

as if it was written by the oil and gas industry. These special 

interests clearly hope to use the report as a weapon in their battle 

to exploit more of our public land for profit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Calling the natural gas potential of the Greater Green River 

Basin 'unavailable or restricted' belies the fact that there are over 

5,000 wells in production and over 7,000 approved wells that have yet 

to be drilled on federal lands in the area,&quot; Shaffer added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Last year, over 486 million cubic feet of natural gas was 

generated from public lands in Wyoming, and over 1,200 leases were 

issued totaling over 1 million acres on public lands in Wyoming. The 

number of completed wells doubled last year over the year before,&quot; he 

continued. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shaffer pointed out that the Energy Department report attacks 

common-sense provisions of federal oil and gas leases that allow 

development of natural gas while also protecting wildlife. In the 

Greater Green River Basin, that wildlife includes bald eagles, 

peregrine falcons, pronghorn antelope and elk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration's report fails to recognize that federal lands 

belong to the American people, not to industry, and the public values 

these lands for the variety of benefits they provide -- chief among 

them the protection of wildlife habitat,&quot; Shaffer said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The so called 'stipulations' the administration finds so 

restrictive protect animals like pronghorn antelope and elk during 

the harsh winter when they are already stressed with limited food and 

freezing temperatures and sensitive birds like sage grouse, hawks, 

eagles, and mountain plovers during nesting season -- while also 

providing access to gas extraction,&quot; Shaffer added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These modest protections only limit certain activities for part 

of the year, and only in limited areas. For example, a common 

protection for mountain plovers is to avoid areas within 200 yards of 

active nests from April to July. Drilling could occur at any other 

time of the year.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Any private landowner would ask for reasonable restrictions on 

oil or gas development on their property to protect their other 

valuable assets,&quot; Shaffer said. &quot;The public expects no less on 

federal land.&quot; </font></p>

organization recognized as one of the nation's most progressive 

advocates for wildlife and its habitat. With more than 430,000 

members and supporters, Defenders of Wildlife is an effective leader
