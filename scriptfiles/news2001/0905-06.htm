- September 5 -  On Thursday, the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) will mark 

two dark anniversaries for East Timor. The rights group will take a variety 

of actions in 20 cities across the United States, including hosting a press 

conference with members of Congress in Washington, DC. These actions will 

call attention to the ongoing refugee crisis and the need for an 

international tribunal for East Timor.



<p>September 6 is the anniversary of the Indonesian military-led massacre in 

1999 in the town of Suai, East Timor, one of the worst after East Timor 

voted overwhelmingly for independence. The date is also the first 

anniversary of the murder of three United Nations refugee workers and 

others by military-backed militia in Atambua, West Timor. A list of 

activities can be found at <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/calendar.htm" target="_new">http://www.etan.org/news/calendar.htm</a>.



<p>"East Timor took an historic step with last week's democratic, multiparty 

election. Yet, the U.S. and the wider international community have failed 

to fully address critical issues," said John M. Miller, spokesperson for 

ETAN. "The victims of past crimes require justice and all refugees in West 

Timor who wish to return must be able to do so."



<p>Approximately one-tenth of those eligible to vote last week in East Timor's 

constituent assembly election could not do so. They were among the 

estimated 80,000 East Timorese still held in squalid refugee camps in 

Indonesian West Timor. Humanitarian workers have described widespread 

malnutrition, epidemics, militia intimidation and violence against women in 

the camps, which are controlled by militia backed by the Indonesian military,



<p>East Timoresereligious, political and community leaders have strongly urged 

the creation of an international tribunal for war crimes and crimes against 

humanity committed in East Timor. They believe an international tribunal is 

necessary for East Timor's healing and reconstruction and have endorsed the 

call by a United Nations special inquiry on East Timor for such a tribunal.



<p>"An international tribunal is the only way to be certain that the 

Indonesian military commanders and political leaders most responsible are 

held accountable for the systematic human rights abuses in East Timor. 

Indonesia does not have the will and East Timor does not have the resources 

or access to try them. An international tribunal is essential to uphold 

international human rights standards and to end the impunity of the 

Indonesian military," added Miller.



<p>In Washington, DC at 11:30 am, tomorrow in Room SC-4 (Capitol Building), 

Senator Tom Harkin (IA) and Representative Jim McGovern (MA) will hold a 

press conference. With Senator Jack Reed (RI), they visited East Timor in 

August 1999 just before its UN-organized referendum. The Indonesian 

military devastated the country in retaliation for the overwhelmingly 

pro-independence vote. On September 6, some two weeks after the members of 

Congress visited Suai, the Indonesian military led a brutal attack on 

refugees sheltering in the town's churchyard, killing at least 200 people, 

including nuns and priests.



<p>Exactly one year later, three international staff with the United Nations 

High Commissioner for Refugees, including U.S. citizen Carlos Caceres, were 

hacked to death and their bodies set on fire by rampaging military-backed 

militia in West Timor as Indonesian police stood by. An unknown number of 

East and West Timorese civilians were also killed that day. Six militiamen 

confessed to the crime, but Indonesian courts sentenced them to prison 

terms of just 10 to 20 months, sparking international condemnation.



<p>To commemorate the anniversaries, ETAN will hold demonstrations at the 

Indonesian Embassy in Washington, DC, and the Indonesian consulates in 

Chicago and San Francisco. Other grassroots actions will take place in 

Tempe, AZ; Seattle; Green Bay, WI; Atlanta, and Philadelphia. These 

demonstrations and vigils will urge Indonesia to fulfill its promises to 

disarm the militia and allow the refugees to return home safely, as well as 

demand justice for the people of East Timor through the establishment of an 

international tribunal. Elsewhere, ETAN members will do local education, 

outreach, and contact the media to raise awareness of the issues.



<p>"Such a high level of activity demonstrates the continued interest in 

justice and security for East Timor, both in Congress and by local 

communities. We are deeply disappointed that the Bush administration has 

not made a priority of a just resolution to East Timor's refugee crisis or 

even publicly called for an international tribunal," said Diane Farsetta, 

ETAN's Field Organizer. "We are disturbed by the administration's stated 

plans to renew ties with the Indonesian military, especially now as this 

repressive force continues its brutal tactics against civilians throughout 

Indonesia. Tomorrow's activities should encourage the administration to 

reconsider," she added.



<p>Senator Harkin is the chief sponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 9 

calling for "the establishment of an international war crimes tribunal to 

prosecute crimes against humanity" carried out by the Indonesian military 

in East Timor. Representative McGovern is a co-sponsor of the companion 

House Concurrent Resolution 60.
