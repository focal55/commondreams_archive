- March 5 - "Our hearts and prayers

go out to the students, staff and their families of Santana High

School. This is yet another example of the tragedies that ensue

when children have easy access to guns. As we approach the second

anniversary of the massacre at Columbine High School, Congress has

still done nothing to prevent such shootings.

<p>"While the details of this shooting are still emerging, we do

know this: we can prevent such tragedies from happening. Whether a

gun is taken from the home or purchased at a gun show or on the

streets, it is simply far too easy for young people to get a hold

of firearms in this country. Every day, we lose 10 young people to

gunfire. Our rate of firearms deaths of children under the age of

15 is 12 times that of 25 other industrialized countries combined.

<p>"I am disappointed by President Bush's statement on this

shooting this afternoon. Yes, it is important to teach our children

morals and values, but the most immediate way to make sure these

shootings don't happen in the first place is to prevent children

from having access to guns. I challenge President Bush to support

the following:

<p>-- Mandatory safety training for gun owners so that they learn

the importance of storing their weapons out of the reach of

children and learn how to store weapons properly;

<p>-- Child access prevention laws, which hold gun owners

responsible when a child gains access to their unsecured gun;

<p>-- Closing loopholes in our laws, such as the gun show loophole,

that enable juveniles and criminals to buy guns;

<p>-- Child safety locks for every gun;

<p>-- Safety standards for child safety locks -- and for guns. Guns

remain specifically exempt from any federal safety regulations.

Just last month, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced

that most gun locks are easily defeated.

<p>"A 1998 study conducted by the Center to Prevent Handgun

Violence found that more than 40 percent of American homes with

children also contain guns. And in 25 percent of those homes, guns

are kept loaded and unlocked. That's why we need to educate gun

owners that they must store their weapons unloaded and locked up,

out of the reach of children.

<p>"But responsibility doesn't just stop with the shooter and the

gun owner. We need to hold the gun industry accountable for making

guns that children and other unauthorized users can fire. Why do

gun manufacturers continue to manufacture guns that don't have any

safety features that would prevent the gun from firing in the wrong

hands?

<p>"In California, as in the rest of the country, it remains too

easy for children to get guns. Handgun Control supports a measure

now being considered by the California legislature that would

require future handgun buyers to obtain a safety license by passing

tests on the responsibilities of gun owners, the best way to secure

handguns so children cannot get them, and basic safe handling of

the weapon. A new California law that requires all guns sold in the

state to have a state-approved child-safety lock to prevent

children and other unauthorized people from using the gun takes

effect on Jan. 1, 2002."
