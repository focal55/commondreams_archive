- January 20 - George

          W. Bush, sworn in today as the nation's 43rd president, announced a

          religious agenda in his inaugural address, including an emphasis on

          using houses of worship for providing publicly financed social

          services.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just

          moments after being sworn in as president, Bush used a speech laced

          with religious rhetoric to explain the role religion will play in his

          administration.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;[S]ome

          needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch

          or a pastor's prayer,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Church and charity,

          synagogue and mosque, lend our communities their humanity, and they

          will have an honored place in our plans and laws.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

          Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for

          Separation of Church and State, expressed concern about Bush's

          comments.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bush

          apparently believes he was elected national preacher as well as

          president,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The newly elected president

          presented himself today as a determined foe of church-state

          separation. The Constitution he swore to uphold simply does not permit

          the president to merge religion and government.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Churches

          and other houses of worship play a cherished role in our society, but

          they do not have a role in our secular laws,&quot; Lynn added.

          &quot;Bush's remarks showed a gross insensitivity to the

          constitutional principle of government neutrality on religion.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush

          also used his inaugural address to emphasize his plans for education,

          remarking, &quot;Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before

          ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.&quot; News agencies were

          reporting today that Bush will unveil an education plan on Tuesday

          that will feature vouchers for religious and other private schools.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Far

          too much of Bush's agenda calls for a unity between church and

          state,&quot; noted AU's Lynn. &quot;To protect the religious liberties

          of all Americans, his plans must be rejected by Congress.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

          one of his first acts as the nation's chief executive, Bush issued a

          proclamation ordering today as a &quot;national day of prayer.&quot;

          Bush, in the proclamation, called &quot;upon the citizens of our

          Nation to gather together in homes and places of worship to pray alone

          and together and offer thanksgiving to God for all the blessings of

          this great and good land.&quot; He added, &quot;I ask Americans to bow

          our heads in humility before our Heavenly Father, a God who calls us

          not to judge our neighbors, but to love them, to ask His guidance upon

          our Nation and its leaders in every level of government.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ironically,

          Bush quoted Thomas Jefferson both in his inaugural address and his day

          of prayer proclamation. Jefferson, a staunch advocate of church-state

          separation, never issued a prayer proclamation in order to preserve

          government neutrality on religious matters.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bush

          would have been wise to follow Jefferson's example and allow Americans

          to make up their own minds about how and when to pray,&quot; said AU's

          Lynn. &quot;It would have gotten the Bush presidency off to a much

          better start.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The

          Bush Administration is only a few hours old and it already has

          signaled remarkable hostility for church-state separation,&quot;

          concluded Lynn. &quot;Anyone concerned with this nation's religious

          liberties should realize that the next four years will be awfully

          busy.&quot;</font></p>
