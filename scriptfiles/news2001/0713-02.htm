- July 13 - Just 48 hours before a high-profile missile defense test, the Marshall Islands police, under pressure from the U.S. military, issued deportation orders and arrested a Greenpeace activist who was camping out on a small island at the Kwajalein missile test range. Richard &quot;Alice&quot; Leney from Australia has been living in a tent on a small island about 10 miles south of where an interceptor rocket will be launched on Saturday night in an attempt to destroy an incoming dummy warhead fired from California's Vandenberg Airforce Base. The scheduled launch is scheduled to test part of President Bush's proposed missile defense system known as Star Wars. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is the action of a dictatorship not a democracy and certainly not a world leader.&quot; said John Passacantando, Executive Director of Greenpeace in the U.S. &quot;It is obviously a desperate attempt, by a desperate U.S. government to suppress any and all opposition to this insane program.&quot; </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Marshall Islands authorities have come under increasing pressure from the U.S. government to arrest Leney since he set up camp following the departure of the Greenpeace ship MV Rainbow Warrior two months ago. U.S. officials have acknowledged that Leney has not been breaking laws by camping out on the uninhabited island with the permission of local landowners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The United States has just tossed the constitution out of the window and you have to wonder how far President Bush will go to force Star Wars on the world&quot; continued Passacantando. &quot;Greenpeace will continue to echo the growing outcry against this dangerous program and we will make sure the message is heard loud and clear.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace activists from around the world will be at Vandenberg Airforce Base in California today, to protest the latest missile defense test scheduled for Saturday. This demonstration is part of Greenpeace's intensive campaign against Bush's Star Wars plan.</font></p>
