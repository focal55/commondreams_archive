<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - August 22 - South Africa's Treatment Action Campaign filed a lawsuit Monday 

against the South African government, escalating their battle to win 

pregnant women access to nevirapine, a drug that cuts rates of HIV 

transmission from mother to infant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">South Africa has the largest number of HIV infected people of any 

country in the world - 4.68 million, or more than 10 per cent of the 

population. Hundreds of HIV positive newborns are born every day in 

South Africa as a result of HIV exposure at and around birth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The South African Government could have avoided this court case,&quot; 

said Asia Russell of the Health GAP Coalition. &quot;Instead they are 

continuing to obstruct access to nevirapine, leaving tens of 

thousands to die preventable deaths.&quot; According to the South African 

Health Department, national HIV infection rates among pregnant women 

were 24.5% during 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Access to nevirapine would prevent HIV infection for at least 20,000 

infants born each year in South Africa. Nevirapine is available at no 

cost to the public sector for preventing transmission from mother to 

infant--but the South African government has refused to allow its 

widespread availability in the public sector.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">250 South African health care providers joined with Treatment Action 

Campaign in lodging the lawsuit; the government has until September 

12 to respond. Treatment Action Campaign will hold protests in South 

Africa on August 27 as a next step.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) is a South African grassroots 

organization dedicated to achieving affordable treatment for people 

living with HIV/AIDS and to preventing new HIV infections. For more
