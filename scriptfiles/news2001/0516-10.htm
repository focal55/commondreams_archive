<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 16 - The following is a 

statement by Gloria Feldt, President of Planned Parenthood 

Federation of America: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration and sponsors of the Hyde-Smith amendment used 

a calculated campaign of misinformation to fool the American 

public. With this slim victory, they have shown that they would 

rather turn their back on the women of the world, on human rights 

and the principles of democracy, to impose the narrow beliefs of a 

few on the rest of the world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Supporters of the Global Gag Rule say they support family 

planning. They don't. Family planning providers around the world 

need to be able to talk freely with their clients and with their 

government about important public health issues. The Gag Rule 

forces providers to withhold information from their clients -- an 

intrusion that would be considered intolerable in the United 

States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Supporters of the gag rule say their policy prevents abortion. 

It doesn't. Twelve years of this policy under the Reagan and Bush 

administrations showed no evidence of reducing abortion. Only if 

people have more access to family planning will there be fewer 

abortions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, supporters of the gag rule say that Americans don't 

want U.S. taxpayer funds to support abortion in other countries. 

They don't. It has been illegal to use any U.S. funds to provide 

abortion services, counseling or referrals, or to lobby to change 

abortion laws, for nearly 30 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the president and the sponsors of this amendment are 

woefully out of step with Americans, and this discord is a threat 

to the health of women and our position as a global leader. 

Americans know that family planning programs prevent abortions, 

prevent the spread of AIDS, and are vital to women's health and the 

health of their families. An overwhelming 80 percent of us have 

said we support international family planning programs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is time to stop playing politics with women's lives. The 

slim margin of victory today proves that many members can see 

through this cynical maneuver. President George W. Bush still has 

an opportunity to listen to the majority of Americans who believe 

that everyone deserves access to family planning. The world is 

watching. </font></p>
