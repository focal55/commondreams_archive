- January 4 - On New Year's Eve, Reverend Jesse Jackson 

        led a delegation to the Ponitac, Illinois Correctional Facility to visit 

        a group of inmates known as the Death Row 10. The Death Row 10, who are 

        all African American men, were convicted and sentenced to death based 

        on confessions rendered under tortuous conditions. Former Chicago Police 

        Commander Jon Burge and his detectives were identified and dismissed for 

        their inhumane and illegal behavior. However, none of the 10 convictions 

        have been overturned. 

      <p align="left">Rev. Jackson elected to reach-out to the Death Row 10, in 

        an effort to shed light on the grave injustices suffered by these men 

        and their families. "The cases of the Death Row 10 are plagued with racial 

        bias and police prosecutorial and judicial misconduct. Governor Ryan has 

        acted boldly and morally by calling for a moratorium on the death penalty 

        but we are calling for abolishment," remarks Jackson. <br>

        <br>

        During the visit, Rev. Jackson was joined by Deputy Governor, Matthew 

        Bettenhausen, Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections, Donnie 

        Sneider, members of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, Campaign to End the Death 

        Penalty and 3 mothers of the Death Row 10. <br>

        <br>

        Reliving their hideous experiences, the men described the electric shock, 

        suffocation, beatings and other brutal forms of physical abuse they were 

        subjected to. Jackson is waging a campaign for the revamping of the criminal 

        justice system and is calling for an end to police brutality. <br>

        <br>

        In concert with Jackson's local efforts, he will travel to Oklahoma City 

        on Thursday to participate in a march for a moratorium on the death penalty 

        in Oklahoma. Eight death row inmates are scheduled for execution in January. 

        While in Oklahoma, Jackson plans to visit Wanda Jean Allen, the first 

        woman to be executed since statehood.<br>

        <br>

        The march is scheduled to begin at 4:30 P.M. at the Mabel Bassett Correctional 

        Center, 3300 North Martin Luther King Ave and journey to the Fairview 

        Baptist Church, 1700 NE 78, where a rally will be held at 6 PM.
