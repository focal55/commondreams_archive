<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest 

administers the Joe A. Callaway award, established by Callaway 

to recognize individuals in any area of endeavor who, with 

integrity and at some personal risk, take a public stand to 

advance truth and justice, and who challenge unsatisfactory 

conditions in pursuit of the common good. Toward this end, 

Callaway endowed the Trust with a special fund for an annual 

award honoring citizens for their civic courage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Shafeek Nader Trust for the Community Interest was 

created to extend the civic values of the late Shafeek Nader, 

community advocate and founder of the Northwestern Connecticut 

Community College. A tax-exempt organization, the Trust has the 

task of advancing the ability of citizens to participate and 

shape the quality of democracy in their community.
