- February 25 -  Greenpeace today blocked a shipment of timber from the destruction of Canada’s Great Bear Rainforest in the Dutch port of Vlissingen. Greenpeace activists, swimming in icy waters, placed themselves between the Norwegian flagged ship Saga Tide and the harbour to block the ship. Simultaneously, four climbers went up the sides of the ship with banners that read “Canadian Forest Crime” and “ No forests, no future”; other activists painted the slogan “Save the Forests” on the hull of the ship.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Netherlands imports around 20,000 cubic meters a year of rainforest timber from British Columbia, Canada. Western red cedar and hemlock are the main timbers imported to Holland for use in the construction industry. Greenpeace is campaigning to ensure the Dutch government and construction companies switch to certified Forest Stewardship Coucil (FSC) timber.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The Canadian government and the timber industry need to know that Greenpeace is not going to stand idle while the Great Bear Rainforest continues to be destroyed,” said Just van den Broek, from Greenpeace Netherlands.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest in Holland is part of a series of Greenpeace actions that have taken place this year in Italy, the US and Hong Kong to bring about a moratorium on logging in the Great Bear Rainforest.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Great Bear Rainforest is home to many threatened species. It is a unique habitat for black tailed deer, grey wolves, grizzly bears and a rare snow-white variation of the black bear called the Kermode or "Spirit Bear". 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"At present, when construction companies buy timber from Canadian logging companies such as Interfor, they are buying rainforest destruction. Their Guilders are fuelling the devastation of some of the world's most endangered forests,” warned van den Broek. Interfor has recently gone back to logging areas of pristine rainforest, including the Surf Inlet region on Princess Royal Island. This region, which is the home of the rare white spirit bear, was assessed by scientists as a core area requiring full protection.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This spring, the Upper House of Dutch Parliament is meeting to talk about a proposition that would make the labeling of wood compulsory in the Netherlands. If the proposition goes through, timber obtained from properly managed forests would carry a green label, while timber from destructive logging would be required to display a red label.
