- December 19 - The Brady Center to 

Prevent Gun Violence today released a new report that details how 

terrorists use weak gun laws to amass firearms in the United 

States. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The document, titled: &quot;Guns and Terror: How Terrorists Exploit 

Our Weak Gun Laws,&quot; was released at a news conference on Capitol 

Hill, at which Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Richard Durbin 

(D-Ill.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) and Reps. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) 

and Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) called for stronger U.S. gun laws as a 

critical component of homeland security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report makes one thing crystal clear: terrorists and guns 

go together,&quot; said Michael D. Barnes, president of the Brady 

Center. &quot;Firearms are part of the essential tool kit of domestic 

and foreign terrorists alike. Guns are used to commit terrorist 

acts, and guns are used by terrorists to resist law enforcement 

efforts at apprehension and arrest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For terrorists around the world, the United States is the Great 

Gun Bazaar. When terrorist training manuals single out the U.S. 

for its easy access to firearms, and when gun runners testify that 

they 'have nothing like this at home,' we know we have a dangerous 

problem. Ensuring true 'homeland security' means combating the 

threat of terrorism in all its possible forms, with all its 

potential weapons -- especially guns.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report notes that, found among the mounds of rubble at a 

training facility in Afghanistan for a radical Pakistan-based 

Islamic terrorist organization, was a manual titled &quot;How Can I 

Train Myself for Jihad&quot; containing an entire section on &quot;Firearms 

Training.&quot; Tellingly, the manual singles out the United States for 

its easy availability of firearms and stipulates that al-Qaeda 

members living in the U.S. &quot;obtain an assault weapon legally, 

preferably AK-47 or variations.&quot; Further, the manual sets forth 

guidelines for how would-be terrorists should conduct themselves in 

order to avoid arousing suspicion as they amass and transport 

firearms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report's release follows the recent acknowledgment by 

Attorney General John Ashcroft that he has refused a request by the 

FBI to use Brady Law criminal background check records to determine 

if any of 1,200 foreign nationals detained after the Sept. 11 

terrorist attacks had bought guns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This special 30-page Brady Center report makes the case for 

stronger gun laws, and for better enforcement of existing laws, as 

an essential part of a comprehensive homeland security program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report details specific cases involving terrorists and guns 

purchased in the U.S. In some instances, the perpetrators have 

been definitively linked to known terrorist organizations. In 

others, the perpetrators acted on their own, but were clearly 

intent on waging a campaign of terror against their targets. All 

of these cases illustrate weaknesses and loopholes in current law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By examining in detail specific cases involving terrorists and 

guns, the report shows that: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Gun shows are a breeding ground for gun sales to terrorists, 

because in most states, unlicensed sellers can sell guns without 

background checks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Nothing in federal law prevents terrorists from quickly 

amassing arsenals of weapons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The irresponsibility of the gun industry, as well as 

irrational statutory restraints on federal record keeping of gun 

sales and other necessary enforcement tools, allows corrupt gun 

dealers to funnel guns to terrorists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Loopholes in federal law have allowed terrorists to buy 

assault weapons and high-capacity military ammunition magazines. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A loophole in federal law allows terrorists to buy &quot;gun kits&quot; 

through the mail that can be assembled into untraceable assault 

weapons. 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the report proposes a specific agenda for reform of 

our nation's gun laws in the interest of national security, 

including: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Requiring complete criminal background checks wherever a gun 

is sold, whether at a gun show, through classified ads or over the 

Internet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Retaining federal background check records and allowing 

reasonable access to those records by federal law enforcement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Limiting large-volume gun purchases to curb trafficking of 

guns to terrorists and criminals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Permanently reauthorizing the assault weapons ban. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The connection between terrorism and guns is undeniable. As 

America conducts its war on terrorism -- at home and abroad -- 

authorities must have the strongest possible mechanisms to root out 

terrorists before they strike. In short, they need the strongest 

possible gun laws. Our national security demands it. </font></p>
