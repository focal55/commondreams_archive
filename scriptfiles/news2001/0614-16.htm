- June 14 -   <a href="http://www.TaxRebatePledge.org" target="new">TaxRebatePledge.org</a>,

a

grassroots movement to get people to pledge their tax rebate checks

to organizations fighting President Bush's conservative agenda, has

received overwhelming support in its first 10 days, with pledges

now over $100,000.

<p>TaxRebatePledge.org's concept is simple. Since its launch on

June 5, it has been asking people to pledge that when they receive

their tax rebate check they will donate that money to an existing

organization that is fighting against George W. Bush and his

conservative agenda. The site features a list of organizations, but

makes no recommendations as to which organization the pledgers

should donate to. When the distribution of the tax rebates begins

in late July, TaxRebatePledge.org will send an e-mail to people who

have pledged reminding them of their promise to fund the fight

against Bush and his agenda.

<p>Through e-mails and mentions on a few Web sites, word has spread

around the Internet about the site. After only 10 days, over

$100,000 in pledges have been made to organizations like the Sierra

Club, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood.

<p>The site is the sole creation of Tony Adams, a Web site

developer in Houston, Texas. He stated, "Over the past few months,

I could sense in the American public a groundswell of frustration

with President Bush and his policies. A great number of people have

been become very concerned by his policies on the environment,

global family planning, the missile defense system, global warming,

and a whole range of other issues. Recently, I made the personal

pledge to donate any money I may receive this year from a tax cut

to organizations that are trying to counteract President Bush's

most conservative policies. When the tax rebate plan was announced,

I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity for people around

America to express their displeasure with the direction in which

President Bush is leading this country and for them to help

counteract his policies."
