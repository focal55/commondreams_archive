- April 18 - Roberto Perez, President of the U'wa people of 

          Colombia will arrive today in Los Angeles for his National Tour (April 

          17-28) to speak out against Plan Colombia and the corporate interest 

          behind the so-called &quot;drug war.&quot; The U'wa people, a peaceful 

          tribe of 5,000 who live in the cloud forests of northeastern Colombia, 

          have captured headlines around the world for their crusade to halt Occidental 

          Petroleum's (OXY) exploratory oil drilling operations on land the tribe 

          considers sacred. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Perez will speak to audiences in Los Angeles, San Diego, Boston, 

          Providence, Stratford (CT), and New York (<a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/ran/info_center/press_release/010418_schedule.html">see 

          attached schedule</a>) ranging from corporate investors to anti-globalization 

          activists, labor unions, and universities on how U.S. oil interests 

          are served by the military aid package. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just two days after Plan Colombia was passed by US congress, the U'wa 

          homeland became heavily militarized and their peaceful blockade against 

          OXY was violently disrupted. Today, several thousand armed soldiers 

          guard the area surrounding the drill site. Meanwhile guerrilla bombings 

          of Oxy's pipeline has dramatically escalated - over sixty attacks so 

          far this year -- in retaliation to U.S. military aid. Fearing that this 

          violence will further spread to the heart of their territory, the U'wa 

          say that they will continue their uncompromising resistance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U'wa chief will speak at the annual shareholder meetings of Occidental 

          Petroleum in Los Angeles and Textron Technologies, the Huey Helicopter 

          manufacturer in Rhode Island. In addition, Mr. Perez will take center 

          stage at demonstrations and vigils at Bernstein/Alliance Capital, OXY's 

          largest investor (New York) and at Sikorsky Aircraft, manufacturer of 

          Black Hawk. These companies have been among the most aggressive lobbyists 

          for the U.S. military aid package. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Boston, Mr. Perez will join Noam Chomsky at the Massachusetts Institute 

          of Technology for a forum on Free Trade Area of the Americas and Plan 

          Colombia, where he will speak out against the perils of globalization 

          and the emerging Colombia oil war. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each day countless innocent civilians are being displaced, terrorized, 

          and assassinated throughout Colombia by armed groups, many with ties 

          to paramilitaries and the Colombian Military. This military is being 

          backed by powerful US interests: oil companies, weapons and helicopter 

          manufacturers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tour was organized to foster growing awareness that fighting the 

          &quot;narco-guerrillas&quot; is only part of the objective of Plan Colombia. 

          Plan Colombia is also about securing access to the country's oil reserves 

          through protecting current oil production as well as &quot;securing&quot; 

          the frontiers in order to tap the unexplored reserves -- an objective 

          that the U.S. Government is not publicly admitting. </font></p>
