- June 13 - Today, Ralph Nader and 

Save Fenway Park! released an economic report concluding that: 1) 

the Red Sox at existing Fenway Park are already financially 

competitive with the rest of Major League Baseball; 2) it is 

unlikely that a new stadium would enhance the Red Sox revenues to 

a point that allows them to be more financially competitive than 

they are now; 3) the proposed new stadium is such an economically 

risky endeavor that a worsening financial condition of the Red Sox 

is a distinct possibility. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was done by nationally known sports economist Robert 

Baade, a professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois who is an 

expert with extensive experience in examining new stadium deals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've known from the beginning that this was a draining deal 

for taxpayers, but Prof. Baade has exposed this debacle to be a bad 

deal or Red Sox fans and even the team itself,&quot; said Nader. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baade predicts in the report that the Red Sox new stadium debt 

service will be so steep that, &quot;Rather than spending increased 

revenues on players, the Red Sox will be retiring debt. The 

long-term implications are worrisome. If the Red Sox are 

increasingly less competitive on the field, the revenues the team 

projects a new stadium will generate will be far less likely to 

materialize. If the new stadium lacks the distinctive character of 

the old, what will bring fans to the ballpark?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fans are being told that Fenway Park has to be replaced because 

it is economically obsolete. But the report released today 

demonstrates that Fenway Park is competitive with the most 

successful new retro-parks built in other cities. It has, overall, 

allowed the Red Sox to field a team with possibly the highest 

payroll in Major League Baseball this year, and maintain the second 

highest winning percentage in MLB since the advent of free agency 

in 1975. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Attendance and revenues are declining at Camden Yards and the 

other retro-parks,&quot; notes Paul Shannon of Save Fenway Park! &quot;The 

Tigers replaced their historic stadium just last year and already 

their average attendance has fallen below 20,000. Meanwhile, 

Fenway Park is bringing in record crowds and revenues for the Red 

Sox. Fenway is not only at the core of the Red Sox' unique 

mystique and team tradition, it is a proven, consistent revenue 

producer -- the team's greatest asset.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Abandoning Fenway Park would needlessly deprive fans of the 

opportunity to experience baseball in one of its greatest fields of 

historic memories,&quot; said Nader. &quot;The stadium deal would destroy the 

magnificent Fenway neighborhood while giving hundreds of millions 

of taxpayer dollars to wealthy owners, bankers and developers in a 

city with many unmet public needs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baade also noted the importance of Fenway Park in his report, 

insisting that &quot;even if the team should flounder, a Fenway Park 

that is growing in historical significance will continue to be a 

magnet for fans from within and beyond Boston's borders. Wrigley 

Field in Chicago continues to attract fans despite the team's below 

average performance. Given growing fan alienation inspired by the 

commercial excesses characteristic of professional sport, this is 

a significant tribute to the appeal of the old ballparks that 

Boston would be unwise to ignore.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time for baseball to value what makes the sport worth 

caring about -- its fans and its heritage -- by respecting and 

honoring its oldest remaining historic ballpark,&quot; said Shannon. </font></p>
