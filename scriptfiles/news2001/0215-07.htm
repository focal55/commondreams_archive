- February 15 - Recent laboratory tests have revealed  that Trader Joe’s, a California-based national supermarket  chain, uses genetically engineered ingredients in its store  brand products, despite customers concerns about the  untested technology. A recent letter from Trader Joe’s to  Greenpeace states that the store’s office gets "up to a  hundred letters a day from customers expressing their  concern that Trader Joe’s products contain genetically  engineered ingredients." 

<p>Genetically altered corn was found in a Trader Joe’s Corn  Bread mix bought from a San Francisco Bay Area store  earlier this month. Greenpeace, which commissioned the  tests, released the results today in front of Trader Joe’s  California headquarters. The international environmental  group was joined by local groups in calling on Trader Joe’s  to eliminate genetically engineered ingredients from its store  brands.  </p>



<p>"Trader Joe’s customers expect safe foods, not secret  genetic experiments hidden in its products," said Heather  Whitehead of Greenpeace. "Grocery stores have an added  responsibility to remove GE from their store brands. Trader  Joe’s works to build trust with its customers, all the while it  is working behind its customer’s backs to use and hide GE  in its own products." 

</p>

<p>In January 2000, two national supermarket chains, Whole  Foods and Wild Oats markets both announced they would  eliminate gene-altered food from their store brand products.  Other major food producers such as Gardenburger, Gerber  and Heinz have also taken action to eliminate genetically  engineered ingredients from their products. </p>



<p>In Europe, Trader Joe’s parent company Aldi has already  stopped using gene-altered ingredients in its store brands.  "We’re calling on Trader Joe’s to end the double standard,"  said Andrea Azuma of the Sierra Club Sustainable Food  Task Force – Angeles Chapter. "If it can eliminate GE foods  in Europe, why not here?" </p>



<p>"Greenpeace’s True Food Network started with Trader  Joe’s today but will be challenging other national grocery  chains in the future," added Whitehead. Trader Joe’s has stores in 14 states. </p>
