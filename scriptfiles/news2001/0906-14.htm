- September 6 - &quot;The Financial Institutions Subcommittee will likely approve 

              controversial legislation today intended to immunize the predatory 

              rent-to-own industry from strong state consumer laws. We&#146;re 

              disappointed, but not surprised, but today&#146;s action is largely 

              due to the industry playing cash register politics, making massive 

              campaign donations, and hiring a lot of lobbyists. The industry 

              has a long, long way to go to pass this bad proposal and now the 

              fight is out in the open.

<p>We&#146;re encouraged that yesterday 52 state and territorial Attorneys 

              General (<a href="http://www.naag.org/features/renttoown.cfm" target="_new">http://www.naag.org/features/renttoown.cfm</a>) 

              came out opposed to HR 1701 because it would unfairly eviscerate 

              stronger state laws that properly treat rent-to-own as a credit 

              transaction. The Jones manager&#146;s substitute is falsely advertised, 

              just like the rent-to-own practices it is designed to protect. It 

              doesn&#146;t create a federal floor, it creates a federal ceiling 

              above which no state can go, since it explicitly preempts all state 

              laws treating rent-to-own as a credit transaction. The industry 

              refuses to agree to comply with laws subjecting its unfair practices 

              to either interest rate ceilings or APR disclosure.</p>

            

<p>We&#146;re also encouraged that last week the New York City Department 

              of Consumer Affairs found Rent-A-Center guilty of 310 consumer law 

              violations (<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/html/rac.html" target="_new">http://www.nyc.gov/html/dca/html/rac.html</a>). 

              That will help get the message out that we need strong laws. Further, 

              we are encouraged that Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum announced 

              last week a veto of a provision protecting the rent-to-own industry 

              from that state&#146;s tough consumer laws.</p>

            <p>We commend Rep. Maxine Waters and others who are fighting to protect 

              consumers from the rent-to-own industry.&quot;</p>
