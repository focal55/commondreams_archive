- June 15 - Halting the two executions -- one federal, one state -- scheduled

for next Tuesday would present an opportunity for the USA to

begin to remedy the damage  done to its international reputation,

Amnesty International said today.</font>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The continuing protests during President Bush's European

visit show how the USA's use of the death penalty is tarnishing

the country's international image,&quot; the organization added,

noting how this was also recently acknowledged by US diplomats.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Judicial killing in the USA is once again under a global

spotlight,&quot; Amnesty International said.  &quot;Here are two more

chances for US officialdom to show that their country's claims to

be world human rights champion are more than just empty

rhetoric.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Juan Raul Garza is set to become the second federal

prisoner put to death by the US Government in eight days, despite

a decision by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that

his execution would be a &quot;deliberate and egregious&quot; violation of

US obligations under international law.  The IACHR cited unfair

evidence introduced at the 1993 trial which resulted in an

&quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; death sentence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The case also raises once again the question -- posed

last year by US government statistics -- of whether race,

ethnicity, or the location of a crime are factors determining who

receives a federal death sentence.   Juan Garza is a

Mexican-American man prosecuted in one of the handful of

jurisdictions accounting for the vast majority of federal capital

prosecutions.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Attorney General is giving out contradictory

signals, giving  the green light for Juan Garza's execution on

the one hand and on the other ordering  further studies into the

question of bias, the results of which could yet benefit Garza,&quot;

Amnesty International said</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     A report published last week by the Justice Department --

widely criticized for its substance and timing -- claimed no

racial bias exists in the federal capital justice system.

However, yesterday, a Senate subcommittee was told that a

comprehensive study would be conducted into the question of the

widespread disparities in the system.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The government can't have it both ways,&quot; Amnesty

International continued.  &quot;Either the system is fair or it is

not.  If there are any doubts about its evenhandedness, the

execution of Juan Garza would be an unconscionable act.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Gerardo Valdez, a Mexican national on death row in

Oklahoma, is also due to be put to death on Tuesday 19 June. As

with most of the more than 90 foreign nationals on death row in

the USA, he was denied his rights to consular assistance after

arrest.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Oklahoma parole board has urged Governor Frank

Keating to commute this death sentence, and his legal advisors

are reported to have acknowledged the treaty violation in the

case,&quot; Amnesty International said, noting that the Mexican

government and the European Union have also intervened.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Governor must do the right thing and grant clemency

to Gerardo Valdez. President Bush must do likewise in the case of

Juan Garza.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Another man, Jay Scott, is scheduled for execution

tonight in Ohio despite the undisputed fact that he suffers from

paranoid schizophrenia.   In the past two months Jay Scott has

twice come minutes from execution.   Amnesty International has

been appealing for the execution to be stopped, this time

permanently.  The UN Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly

called on countries not to use the death penalty against people

who suffer &quot;from any form of mental disorder&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background

The issue of consular rights for foreign nationals in the US

capital justice system was brought before the International Court

of Justice by Germany last year following the execution of two

German nationals. The Court is due to rule on the case shortly.</font></p>
