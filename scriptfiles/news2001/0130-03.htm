- January 30 - Proponents of deregulation have developed a repertoire of

excuses for why electricity deregulation is failing miserably. Rather than admitting that

a speculative market for a life-sustaining commodity such as electricity does not work,

they have cultivated such myths as, &quot;California just didn&#146;t deregulate

enough.&quot; 

<p>In fact, if the retail price for electricity was completely deregulated as the industry

suggests, the average consumer&#146;s electric bill would be $600, rather than the

approximately $55 charged before deregulation, according to Public Citizen&#146;s

calculations.</p>



<p>This is just one of ten myths debunked by a Public Citizen <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0130-04.htm">report released

today</a>. The report examines in detail arguments that deregulation proponents are making

and explains why these contentions are false.</p>



<p>&quot;Already, consumers and small businesses have been hijacked because

California&#146;s deregulation law, which has allowed so-called &#145;free market&#146;

forces to reign in California&#146;s electricity market, has allowed power suppliers to

rake in billions in excess profits,&quot; Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook said.</p>



<p>By both exerting market power and manipulating the next day&#146;s spot market for

electricity, these suppliers keep electricity supplies low and prices high, for instance

by employing unscheduled power plant closings. They have created a crisis in California

that may drive the state into a recession and has done nothing to ensure that consumers

have affordable, reliable electricity. </p>



<p>In keeping with their long-range business plans to dramatically expand sales, power

suppliers blame the current problems on too few power plants. Their solution is to repeal

power plant and transmission line siting laws and to suspend environmental regulations

that protect people&#146;s health, so that they can engage in a building frenzy.</p>



<p>&quot;If the power suppliers selling electricity in California have their way and

retail prices for this important commodity are left to the vagaries of the market, the

average consumer could be paying 12 times more for electricity than they were before

deregulation,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and

Environment Program.</p>



<p>The myths include: 



<ul>

  

<li><b>Prices are high because California&#146;s strict environmental standards have slowed

    power plant construction</b> . In fact, there is currently more than enough capacity to

    meet maximum demands. Power demand during four of the past six months in California was

    lower than during the same period in 1999. However, power producers under deregulation

    have strong incentives not to run plants at full capacity or to shut them down altogether

    to manipulate prices. Even so, since April 1999, the state&#146;s Energy Commission has

    approved nine major new power plant projects, six of which are under construction. </li>

</ul>



<ul>

  

<li><b>The purpose of deregulation was to lower costs for consumers</b> . To the contrary,

    deregulation has resulted in higher prices for consumers. Even if long-term contracts are

    entered into with suppliers, as is being discussed by state officials, consumers will

    still be paying an average of three times more for the price of electricity than they

    would have under sensible regulation.</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  

<li><b>Deregulation is good for the environment.</b>  Market forces driving deregulation will

    only encourage cost-cutting measures that will result in more pollution. In fact,

    deregulation creates incentives to produce power from the cheapest source &#151; dirty

    coal plants. Suppliers want to continue operating these older plants as long as possible,

    because it costs less than building new, more efficient plants. (The new plants being

    proposed would run in addition to existing plants.) Deregulation thus provides no

    incentive for conservation, which produces no profits for power producers.</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  

<li><b>California&#146;s energy crisis is best resolved through state, not federal, actions. </b>Under the deregulation law, California&#146;s utilities sold most of their fossil fuel

    power plants to out-of-state power wholesalers who are profiting at the expense of

    consumers. To remedy this situation requires federal action. The best short-term solution

    for the crisis would be for the federal government to impose cost-based rates on these

    power suppliers, who now are charging utilities outrageous prices and far more than

    utilities are permitted to charge consumers. The federal government is the sole entity

    with the power to do this. This action would give California time to thoughtfully

    restructure its electric industry.</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  

<li><b>California&#146;s utilities are close to bankruptcy and need to be bailed out.</b> In

    fact, the utilities&#146; parent companies have spent billions on buying other assets in

    recent months. They should be forced to sell off these assets before having the state

    &#150; and therefore, the taxpayers &#150; assume the burden and future risk for utility

    debts. </li>

</ul>



<ul>

  

<li><b>Electricity deregulation is working in other states.</b> In other states that have

    deregulated, like Pennsylvania, the temporary protections that made deregulation

    legislation politically viable for passage are still in effect. Pennsylvania&#146;s

    utilities have a regulated rate for electricity that new suppliers must beat to be

    competitive. Over the next few years, as these protections are sunset, we will see many

    states follow in California&#146;s footsteps if deregulation is not canceled.</li>

</ul>
