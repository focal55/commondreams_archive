- September 4 - The Green Party of the United

States calls the increasing use of genetically

engineered crops a looming disaster for public health,

for the right to know about what we eat, for

environmental stability and safety, and for policies

supporting sustainable agriculture to enable farmers

to compete and sell crops in the global market place.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Farmers become victims of international trade

promotion sanctioned by a U.S. Congress that appears

willing to subvert laws of national governments to

those of unelected, unaccountable international trade

organizations,&quot; said Nancy Allen, media co-coordinator

of the Green Party and a farmer in Maine.  &quot;The rush

to approve such decisions shows a regulatory process

dominated by global agricultural and biotechnological

corporations.  Congress and the White House are

greasing the wheels, thanks to powerful lobbies and

campaign contributions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fast Track will inundate South and Central America

with genetically engineered seeds, ruining indigenous

farmers who each year carefully save their seeds,

especially corn.  Indigenous farmers, unlike Monsanto

and D&amp;PL (Delta &amp; Pine Land), have no say in the

decisions of 'free trade' authorities like the Free

Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and the World Trade

Organization (WTO).  The same authorities hold the

power to force genetically modified products on

markets in countries that have rejected such foods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Department of Agriculture has already

approved Terminator seeds, allowing D&amp;PL to modify

plants genetically in order to produce sterile seeds,

preventing farmers from re-using harvested seed and

compelling their dependence on D&amp;PL, which has

publicly declared its intention to commercialize

Terminator seeds.  The USDA and its Advisory Committee

on Agricultural Biotechnology (founded by the Clinton

Administration), in licensing the Terminator Seed

technology to D&amp;PL, ignored objections from civil

society, international agricultural research

institutes, and United Nations bodies.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greens call such licenses corporate welfare at the

expense of small and family-owned farms, civil

liberties, and biological safety and stability,&quot; said

Ronnie Cummins, national director of the Organic

Consumer Association and the Biodemocracy Campaign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Canadian scientists have found evidence that

genetically modified crops have begun to spread far

and wide from where they've been planted, spawning

'superweeds' and interbreeding with crops from

neighboring farms.  Organic farms are at greatest

risk, since mixing with genetically modified crops

would cancel their claim to organic status.  A Wall

Street Journal study published on April 5 found that

16 out of 20 food products with labels indicating no

genetic modification contained evidence of genetic

material used to modify plants. 

 

According to a quote by food industry consultant Don

Westfall in the Toronto Star on January 9, 2001, &quot;The

hope of the industry is that over time the market is

so flooded [with genetically engineered organisms]

that there's nothing you can do about it.&quot; Westfall,

who supports the development of genetically modified

foods, is vice-president of Promar International, a

consulting company based in a Washington, D.C. suburb.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Environmental Protection Agency is currently

considering a proposal to allow corn to be genetically

engineered to produce an insecticide (the Bt toxin,

one of a family of related molecules produced by a

soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis).  This poses

enormous risks: threats to the butterfly population

(including the Monarch and the Karner Blue); possible

allergic reactions to the toxin; contamination of

organic crops; and evolution of Bt resistant strains

of insects, who will not be affected by biodegradable

Bt spray used by organic farmers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens all over the world have spoken out against the

genetic engineering of crops and corporate patents on

genetic information and cell lines.  Greens and

environmental activists in New Zealand have declared

August 31 &quot;GE Free Day&quot; and are demanding that genetic

engineering be &quot;kept in the lab&quot; in reaction to a

Royal Commission into Genetic Modification report

recommending that open field trials begin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When George W. Bush took office, Steve Forbes

predicted that 'we're going to get as much as we can

as fast as we can,'&quot; noted Nancy Allen.  &quot;With the

coming vote in Congress on so-called 'fast track'

trade, Forbes' boast appears to be on target. This is

especially true when we consider the link between

promotion of genetically engineered foods and the

passage of trade deals.&quot; </font></p>
