- June 25 - A broad-based coalition of community leaders -- representing more than 100 million Americans and over $300 billion in annual revenues -- gathered today at a Citizens Summit on Climate Change to urge lawmakers to slow global warming. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We come from different backgrounds and perspectives, but we all agree that global warming is one of the century's most pressing environmental, economic, and ethical concerns,&quot; said Howard Ris, President of the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;All segments of society have a responsibility to act, and our government, including both the Congress and the Bush administration, should lead the way.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 40 business executives, religious leaders, economists, and scientists from 12 key states are attending the three-day Citizens Summit, which includes workshops, an inter-faith service, and meetings with congressional representatives and their staff. The sponsoring organizations' members include faith groups such as the United States Catholic Conference and the National Council of Churches of Christ, and businesses such as Enron, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, Maytag, and York International, as well as scientists conducting research on climate change. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To be faithful stewards of the Earth, we must curb global warming,&quot; said Paul Gorman, Executive Director of the National Religious Partnership for the Environment. &quot;The United States is disproportionately responsible for the global warming problem. As a result, our nation has a moral obligation to lead the response.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the summit, 12 state petitions signed by more than 800 scientists were sent to Capitol Hill calling for stronger congressional leadership and policies to stem global warming. The scientists agree that an unprecedented consensus exists among the world's climate change community that global warming is underway and that its effects on people, the environment, and the economies of their state, country, and the world will be increasingly obvious in our children's lifetimes. The scientists are convinced that enough is known about global warming to warrant bold action to prevent the worst consequences of a warming climate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Businesses across the country have demonstrated that reducing carbon emissions will not threaten economic growth,&quot; said Michael Marvin, President of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. &quot;In fact, clean energy technologies could substantially slow climate change while cleaning the air and creating more jobs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event was organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists in cooperation with the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center, Midwest Global Warming Leadership Council, and the National Religious Partnership for the Environment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The scientist signers are all masters- or Ph.D.-level scientists in the physical,life, medical, or social sciences whose research, teaching, resource management, or policy roles are related to the science, impacts, or mitigation of the climate issue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The breakdown of scientist signers per state: Florida 131,  Illinois 65,  Indiana 41,  Iowa 45,  Louisiana 54,  Maryland 89,  Maine 59,  Michigan 85,  New Hampshire 50,  New Mexico 30,  Ohio 88 , Washington 80. <br>
