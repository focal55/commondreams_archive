- January 26 - On Tuesday, January 30, a full-page People For the American

Way ad in newspapers across the country will pose the question

to the American people that their U.S. Senators will be required

to answer during the coming days:

<p>"Should a man who misrepresents the facts under oath be our

Attorney General?"

<p>The ad details and documents four of the areas in which John

Ashcroft misrepresented or evaded the facts of his own record in

sworn testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It

includes:

<p>-- his bitter battle against voluntary school desegregation

in St. Louis;

-- his advocacy, while he was Missouri's Attorney General and

responsible for upholding the law, of federal legislation to

enable states to end women's right to choose abortion;

-- his unfair and mean-spirited campaign of distortions

against a federal court nominee, Judge Ronnie White; and

-- his campaign against the confirmation of James Hormel, a

highly qualified gay man nominated to be U.S. Ambassador to

Luxembourg.

<p>"John Ashcroft used his testimony to mislead the Senators

through evasions, denials, and outright contradictions of the

documented public record of his own actions and statements,"

said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way.

"The question that the Senators must answer is whether a nominee

who so distorts and evades the facts under oath should be

entrusted with the responsibility of upholding our nation's

civil and constitutional rights."

<p>The ad encourages readers to contact their Senators by

calling their offices or signing an online petition at PFAW's

dedicated website: www.OpposeAshcroft.com. On Tuesday, PFAW

delivered over 130,000 petitions from all 50 states to the

Senate and is planning to deliver the second installment next

week, as tens of thousands of petitions continue to pour in.

<p>The ad is scheduled to appear on January 30 in 11 newspapers:

The New York Times, USA Today, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel,

The (Fargo, ND) Forum, the Bismarck (ND) Tribune, the (Sioux

Falls, SD) Argus Leader, the Rapid City (SD) Journal, the Bangor

(ME) Daily News; the Portland (ME) Press Herald, the (New

Orleans) Times Picayune, and the Hartford Courant. It will also

appear in the Thursday, February 1 edition of the twice-weekly

Washington, DC paper, Roll Call. Full text of the ad is attached

and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.OpposeAshcroft.com.">http://www.OpposeAshcroft.com.</a>

Text of Ashcroft ad:

<p>SHOULD A MAN WHO MISREPRESENTS THE FACTS UNDER OATH BE OUR

ATTORNEY GENERAL?

<p>John Ashcroft wants to be U.S. Attorney General, the highest

law enforcement officer in the land.

<p>But Ashcroft used his sworn testimony before the Judiciary

Committee to mislead the Senators. In some cases, he made

statements that are directly contradicted by the facts of his

record. In others, he used denial or evasion to try to distance

himself from extreme actions and statements from his past in an

apparent effort to reinvent himself as dedicated only to

upholding the law, rather than to any ideological agenda.

<p>What Ashcroft says and what Ashcroft's record shows:

<p>Under oath, Ashcroft said he followed the law and obeyed the

courts' orders as Missouri's Attorney General. Transcript of

Ashcroft Senate Confirmation Hearings

<p>But during his bitter 10-year legal battle against voluntary

school desegregation in St. Louis, a federal court sharply

criticized his "continual delay and failure to comply" with

court orders and concluded that "the state has, as a matter of

deliberate policy, decided to defy the authority of the court."

Associated Press, St. Louis Post-Dispatch

<p>Under oath, he said he understood that an Attorney General's

role is not to make the laws but to enforce them and implied

that he would not use his power as Attorney General to try to

take away women's constitutional right to make their own

reproductive decisions. Transcript of confirmation hearings

<p>But as Missouri's Attorney General, Ashcroft did not hesitate

to push to severely limit that right. In fact, he even testified

before Congress to argue for federal legislation that would have

had the effect of overturning Roe v. Wade. As a U.S. Senator he

sought an abortion ban so sweeping that it would force rape

victims to bear their attacker's child and could outlaw birth

control pills and IUDs. John Ashcroft now wants the Senators to

believe he is ready to put aside these views in favor of

enforcing Roe v. Wade and other abortion rulings and laws.

Hearings Before Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on S.158 ("Human

Life Bill"); St. Louis Post-Dispatch; S.J. Res. 49 ("Human Life

Amendment"); S. 2135 ("Human Life Act");

Human Events

<p>Under oath, Ashcroft testified about his efforts to defeat

the federal court nomination of Judge Ronnie White, the first

African American to serve as a Missouri Supreme Court Judge.

Ashcroft admitted that he had called White's record

"pro-criminal" but said he "did not derogate his background."

Transcript of confirmation hearings

<p>But the record of Ashcroft's mean-spirited campaign of

distortions against White includes his charge that White would

"use his lifetime appointment to push law in a pro-criminal

direction, consistent with his own personal political agenda."

Congressional Record

<p>Under oath, he said he has not discriminated against gays and

did not block James Hormel's confirmation as Ambassador to

Luxembourg because Hormel is gay. Transcript of confirmation

hearings

<p>But while Ashcroft was waging his campaign against Hormel's

confirmation, he was quoted as objecting to Hormel for

"promoting a lifestyle" that he said could be "offensive" to

people in Luxembourg. News reports show that it was widely

acknowledged, even by Republicans, that the opposition to

Hormel's confirmation was based on his sexual orientation.

Boston Globe; San Diego Union Tribune

<p>John Ashcroft says we can trust him to uphold our fundamental

constitutional and civil rights. But with all he's done -- and

all that's at stake -- how can we?
