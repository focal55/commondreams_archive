- March 7 - As debate continues over President Bush's tax cut plan, Billionaires for

Unlimited Inheritance, a coalition of the mega-rich, will come together

Wednesday in Newark to call for the complete abolition of the estate tax. &nbsp;They will declare their support for Senator Robert Torricelli, who has 

voted to abolish the tax, and urge him to stand strong against the 

proponents of &quot;tax fairness&quot; and &quot;justice.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Billionaires for Unlimited Inheritance will rally WEDNESDAY, MARCH 7, at

12:30 p.m. outside of Senator Torricelli1s Newark office at 1 Riverfront

Plaza with songs, speeches, and chants. The rally was postponed from Monday,

March 5, as the Billionaires feared snow damage to their furs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Republican &nbsp;and Democratic conventions this summer, the Billionaires

were out in full force, holding a Million Billionaire March to demonstrate

their influence over the candidates and show off their fiscal prowess. &nbsp;They

were featured in the Washington Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, Boston Globe,

BBC, Time Magazine, and several major networks in Philadelphia and Los

Angeles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that the election season is over, the Billionaires are focusing on tax

cuts for themselves, particularly the abolition of the estate tax. &nbsp;&quot;A tax

aimed at the top 2% is a tax aimed at us,&quot; said co-chair Phil T. Rich.&quot;We've paid far too much in campaign contributions to pay these taxes as

well!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moreover,&quot; added co-chair Robert &nbsp;Baron, &quot;how can we cultivate a sense of

entitlement in our children if we can't promise them massive untaxed

inheritances?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rich added that eccentrics &nbsp;like Warren Buffett who recently expressed

support for the estate tax are a clear minority. &nbsp;&quot;Look carefully at who

issued that Responsible Wealth statement&#139;some &nbsp;of them are piddling small

business &nbsp;people! &nbsp;We know that Senator Torricelli will support the

outrageously rich and end the estate tax.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives of &nbsp;Billionaires for Unlimited Inheritance are available for

interviews. There will be many humorous PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES. More

information about the organization is available at the website
