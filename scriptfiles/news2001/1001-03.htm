<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 1 -  A group of 20 authors sent letters today to 85 book review editors

asking them to treat Fay Weldon's new work &quot;The Bulgari Connection&quot; as

what it is -- an advertisement for the Italian jewelry firm of that

name.  The text of the letter follows.	</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear [book review editor]:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you know, Fay Weldon recently produced a written work called &quot;The

Bulgari Connection.&quot;  Ms. Weldon received a substantial -- but

undisclosed -- sum of money from the Bulgari jewelry company to feature

the company in the written work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question now is how you and others in the media will treat this

written work.  Is it a novel to be reviewed, or is it an advertisement

to be commented upon in the business pages?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many complex issues confront us all these days.  Fortunately this is not

one of them. When a corporation pays a writer to produce copy that

features the corporation's product, the result is called advertising. 

Weldon herself acknowledged this when she called her work a &quot;good piece

of advertising prose.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She should know. In the 1960s she worked as a copy writer for the Ogilvy

and Mather advertising agency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue here is not the supposed purity of literature or of writers. 

It is not about the taint of commerce.  The issue is simply calling

things by their right names.  This is one of our first responsibilities

as journalists and writers, and it is what we urge you to do in this

case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bulgari Connection&quot; is like a Kodak Moment or a Budweiser Whassup! 

It is an advertisement; and we should call it that and deal with it

accordingly. As a copy writer, Ms. Weldon is entitled to all the

accolades and esteem available to the members of her profession.  She

should be eligible for a Clio.  She can receive offers from other

clients.  Her future in advertising probably is bright.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Weldon will have her due rewards.  But she should not expect to be

treated as an author, any more than the producer of magazine ads for

Nike or Marlboro expects to be treated as an author.  That her copy

promotes a high class jewelry store, does not somehow lift it into the

realm of literary art.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If a copy of Ms. Weldon's work arrives on your desk, we urge you to send

it to the business editor.  Save your book reviews for writers whose

poems and plots were not bought before they were imagined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
