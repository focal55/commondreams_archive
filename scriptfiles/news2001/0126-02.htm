- January 26 - As a member of the National Rifle Association, attorney 

        general nominee John Ashcroft supports an organization that has labeled 

        federal law enforcement agents—including those of the Justice Department's 

        own Federal Bureau of Investigation—"jack-booted government thugs" and 

        compared FBI agents to goose-stepping Nazis, asking, "What's the first 

        step to a police state? When the FBI states the rules." 

      <P>In response to this attack on federal law enforcement agents and officials, 

        in 1995 former President George H. W. Bush resigned as a Life Member from 

        the NRA, stating, "To attack Secret Service Agents or ATF people or any 

        government law enforcement people as `wearing Nazi bucket helmets and 

        black storm trooper uniforms' wanting to `attack law abiding citizens' 

        is a vicious slander on good people." 

      <P>The NRA has also repeatedly attacked current FBI Director Louis Freeh 

        for his promise during his 1993 Senate confirmation hearing to "enforce 

        diligently and exhaustively" gun legislation passed by Congress. In his 

        resignation letter from the NRA, the former president also defended Freeh, 

        noting that his "integrity and honor are beyond question." Bush concluded 

        that "your broadside against Federal agents deeply offends my own sense 

        of decency and honor; and it offends my concept of service to country." 

      <P>VPC Executive Director Josh Sugarmann states, "John Ashcroft faces a 

        clear choice. Will he stand with federal law enforcement and enforce our 

        nation's gun laws, or will he continue to side with the NRA—which compares 

        the FBI, its agents, and Director Louis Freeh to Nazis. The answer was 

        clear to former NRA member George H. W. Bush, and it should be just as 

        clear to current NRA member John Ashcroft."
