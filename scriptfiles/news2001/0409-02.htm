- April 9 - The Village Voice, the nation's largest

alternative weekly newspaper, today announced the launch of Voice Radio, an

online radio station which will debut on April 11.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike anything on the Internet or radio, Voice Radio breaks traditional

rules about music and radio programming by creating a radio program

comprised of premier content for the web with streaming services provided by

StreamAudio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voice Radio, which can be accessed at www.villagevoice.com, delivers a smart

edgy, lifestyle driven format reflecting the attitudes and taste of the

Village Voice's discerning readers. Music will range from rock to jazz to

blues and hip-hop, from techno to deep house to drum n' bass from blue-beat

to back-beat and beat-box.  Additionally, Voice Radio will host live music

from clubs and local venues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A venture of Village Voice Media, Voice Radio will soon be accessible

through all Village Voice Media newspaper sites and may eventually be

syndicated nationally. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Village Voice has played an indispensable role in music history since

1957 when Billie Holiday graced the Voice's cover.  Bruce Springsteen found

his E Street Band in the Voice's music classifieds.&quot; said Greg Goff,

President of New Media. &quot;The Voice has a long tradition of presenting a

broad range of cutting edge and eclectic music. Traditional radio has become

controlled by a few major players, all delivering similar sounding formats.

This has opened the opportunity for the Voice to introduce a radio format

that our young urban audience can really get excited about.&quot;<br>

 <br>

In addition to an exhaustive genre-bending play-list, Voice Radio makes

web-broadcasting history by being among the fist to broadcast specialty

programming such as:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*	The Dean's List -The Voice's Robert Christgau hosts a weekly show

patterned after his signature Consumer's Guide to pop music<br>

*	<br>

*	Sessions -A weekly concert series from the hottest clubs in

Manhattan.  Covering the scene from underground to unsigned, from

independent to major label artists<br>

*	<br>

*	La Dolce Musto-The Voice's own Michael Musto will reveal the

highlights of his popular column in which he rubs shoulders with the rich,

famous, poor, infamous, and the fabulous<br>

*	<br>

*	Acoustic Breakfast -Singer/songwriter series.  A perfect morning

companion to your coffee and bagels<br>

*	<br>

*	Empire-Don Rainwater and guest DJ's will explore New York's

*	The World Caf&eacute; -Music and interviews with host David Dye<br>

*	<br>

*	Voice Roundtable-A weekly talk show, covering a mind-boggling range

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voice Radio plans to take the music to the streets of New York with an

aggressive marketing campaign which will debut this month.</font></p>
