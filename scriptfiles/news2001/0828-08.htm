<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DURBAN, South Africa 

- August 28 -  A diverse group 

of U.S. civil and human rights leaders attending the World Conference 

Against Racism (WCAR) in Durban, South Africa issued the following 

statement today regarding the United States government's 

participation at the WCAR set to begin Friday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The WCAR represents a historic opportunity for hundreds of 

nations around the world to acknowledge, discuss and combat issues of 

racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance. 

The United States government should participate in the global 

dialogue taking place in Durban and should do so at a level that 

reflects its responsibilities as a world leader. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The core principles upon which our nation was founded -- equality 

of opportunity, freedom of expression, and individual liberty -- are 

the same principles that the WCAR participants are working to make a 

reality for all people around the world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. should join the discussion to celebrate the progress we 

have made and share the lessons we have learned, while at the same 

time, using this historic opportunity, to renew our commitment to 

further advance equality and justice at home and throughout the 

world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No nation comes to this conference with entirely clean hands: 

racism and intolerance are global issues that affect every nation. 

We strongly believe that no one country should be singled out for 

special contempt, nor exempt from a review of its civil and human 

rights practices. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In attending the WCAR, nations agree to participate in a full and 

open debate, one that acknowledges the historic effects of racism, 

xenophobia, and intolerance while simultaneously working to develop 

strategies to eradicate these evils in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a vigorous defender of free speech, it would be ironic for the 

U.S. to refuse the opportunity to present its views in the 

marketplace of ideas that the WCAR provides. To the extent that it 

disagrees with the views of other nations, the U.S. should engage the 

WCAR to help shape the Conference's Declaration and Plan of Action. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WCAR will be tackling a wide array of significant domestic and 

international issues that are important to all Americans and others 

around the world. Educational quality, economic and employment 

opportunity, access to health care, criminal justice, voting rights, 

migration and refugees, discrimination against women, environmental 

justice, persons with disabilities, and sexual orientation are among 

the many issues that will be discussed. If the U.S. fails to 

participate in the conference at a meaningful level, the Bush 

Administration would be sending a message that the U.S. has further 

relinquished its place as a world leader on civil and human rights.&quot; </font></p>
