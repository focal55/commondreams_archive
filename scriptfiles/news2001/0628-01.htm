<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONDON - June 28 - Leading environmental organization Greenpeace has joined forces with international high street retailer, The Body Shop, today, to challenge world governments to provide access to renewable energy for all, in particular the two billion people who live without any power, within ten years. Currently, one third of the world&#146;s population live without access to electric lighting or adequate cooking facilities. Everyone has the right to power but many of the world&#146;s poorest are already experiencing the devastating impacts of climate change through increased floods, drought and disease, the result of centuries of the world&#146;s use of fossil fuel energy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two organizations have launched a new study &quot;Power to Tackle Poverty&quot; to provide a framework showing world governments how this ambitious target can be met and are urging G8 leaders to take action following their discussion of renewable energy at their summit in Genoa (20-22 July) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Morrison, Head of Campaigns of The Body Shop said: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are taking on two of the world&#146;s most crucial issues - climate change and global poverty - and offering sustainable solutions. If the world&#146;s governments commit to our proposals, we stand a good chance of avoiding a potential climate catastrophe, and ensuring the world&#146;s poor have access to clean and reliable energy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Janet Dalziell, Greenpeace project leader added, </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush walked away from the Kyoto treaty, with the excuse that the world&#146;s poorest countries are not doing their bit to tackle climate change. But the US and the other rich countries are not only responsible for most of the world&#146;s pollution but are funding massive dirty power stations in the developing world. Bush and the other polluters must stop this hypocrisy and switch their aid from dirty power to clean energy to reduce the threat of climate change for all of us and help bring renewable energy to those who have no power at all. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With this partnership we will be working to create the political will, at the G8 and beyond, to take concrete action to protect the climate. We will be looking for support from as many people and organizations as possible to pressure governments and energy companies to make these changes.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lack of access to energy is one of the key factors that keeps people trapped in poverty. According to the International Energy Agency, providing modern energy systems that meet basic needs for clean water, health care facilities, heating and lighting is one of the most pressing problems facing humanity today. Currently much of the developing world&#146;s energy requirements are met by kerosene lanterns and inefficient, smoky stoves, which are damaging to health. Increased use of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas in the developing world will increase the problem of climate change, which is already devastating many lives of poor people. The only way to meet the legitimate needs of 1/3rd of the world is via renewable energy such as wind, solar and small hydro systems. It will mean a massive increase in the size of current renewables industries, and provide a boost for economies the world over. Anthony Derrick, Director of the organization IT Power which wrote the report, said: &quot;Greenpeace and The Body Shop have today set out a very ambitious challenge to governments. It is a challenge that can be met provided governments are prepared to demonstrate they have the political will and will make the required capital investments in energy systems for the future, instead of relying on the polluting fossil fuels and nuclear projects that should be left in the past.&quot; </font></p>
