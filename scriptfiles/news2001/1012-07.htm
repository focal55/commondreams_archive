<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 

- October 12 - On October 10, television network executives from ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and CNN

held a conference call with national security adviser Condoleeza Rice, and

apparently acceded to her &quot;suggestion&quot; that any future taped statements from

Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda group be &quot;abridged,&quot; and any potentially&quot;inflammatory&quot; language removed before broadcast.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question of how to present the words of bin Laden or representatives of

Al Qaeda is certainly a valid one for journalists to consider. The

statements require context and explanation of the kind journalists should

use to bracket the remarks of any party in a major news story.  But it is

inappropriate for the government to dictate to journalists how to report the

news. In the context of recent heavy-handedness on the part of the

administration (including White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's ominous

remark that Americans &quot;need to watch what they say&quot;), Rice's request

suggests that the White House is actually asking for something other than

simple journalistic judgement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Originally the administration expressed concern about the possibility of Al

Qaeda members sending &quot;coded messages&quot; to their followers in the segments.

But Rice's main argument to the networks seems to have been that bin Laden's

statements must be restricted because of their content.  NBC News chief Neal

Shapiro told the New York Times that Rice's main point &quot;was that here was a

charismatic speaker who could arouse anti-American sentiment getting 20

minutes of air time to spew hatred and urge his followers to kill

Americans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although presented as only a call for caution, there's a danger that the

White House conference call may make broadcasters think twice about airing

any footage of bin Laden at all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following day, Fleischer took the administration's campaign further and

contacted major newspapers to request that they consider not printing full

transcripts of bin Laden's messages. &quot;The request is to report the news to

the American people,&quot; said Fleischer. &quot;But if you report it in its entirety,

that could raise concerns that he's getting his prepackaged, pretaped

message out&quot; (New York Times, 10/12/01).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To its credit, the Times has apparently resisted such requests, but some

media executives seem to actually appreciate the White House pressure.&quot;We'll do whatever is our patriotic duty,'' said News Corp executive Rupert

Murdoch (Reuters, 10/11/01).  In an official statement, CNN declared: &quot;In

deciding what to air, CNN will consider guidance from appropriate

authorities'' (Associated Press, 10/10/01). CNN chief Walter Isaacson added,&quot;After hearing Dr. Rice, we're not going to step on the land mines she was

talking about&quot; (New York Times, 10/11/01).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The point is not that bin Laden or Al Qaeda deserve &quot;equal time&quot; on U.S.

news broadcasts, but that it is troubling for government to shape or

influence news content. Withholding information from the public is hardly

patriotic. When the White House insists that it's dangerous to report a news

event &quot;in its entirety,&quot; alarm bells should go off for journalists and the

American public alike.</font></p>
