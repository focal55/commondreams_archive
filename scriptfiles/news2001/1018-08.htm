- October 18 - The following is a letter 

from Ralph Nader and James Love to Secretary Thompson regarding 

ciprofloxacin: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 18, 2001 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tommy G. Thompson <br>

Secretary of Health and Human Services <br>

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <br>

200 Independence Avenue, S.W. <br>

Washington, D.C. 20201 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Secretary Thompson: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We were shocked by your comments in the October 17, 2001 

Washington Post, indicating that you do not have the legal 

authority to authorize generic production of ciprofloxacin, a drug 

used to treat victims of an anthrax attack. This, of course, is 

not true. As your own staff is well aware, you may use 28 USC 1498 

to issue compulsory licenses for patents, and you could immediately 

authorize the five companies who have already satisfied U.S. FDA 

requirements for the quality of their products to speed the 

manufacturer of ciprofloxacin, and indeed this could and should be 

done for any other medicine needed to confront the current crisis. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By failing to act, you are putting Americans at risk. By acting 

to authorize generic competitors to manufacture ciprofloxacin, you 

would reduce public anxiety over the supply of the drug, and take 

steps to introduce competition which would ensure redundant 

capacity and a more favorable procurement environment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is our understanding that public health authorities are 

seeking a stockpile of 1.2 billion pills in order to ensure that 

there are treatments for 10 million Americans. It is obvious that 

the fastest and most efficient way to accomplish this is to 

authorize every qualified pharmaceutical company who can supply the 

drug to do so. Anything short of this is cutting corners. Why put 

the lives of millions of Americans at risk? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans are facing a public health crisis that demands 

leadership and action. It is unacceptable, in the face of a 

biological assault against U.S. citizens, to fail to secure 

adequate supplies of medicines in the event that anthrax exposure 

spreads. Moreover, you may soon find we confront a different 

access problem for another medicine, in the face of a different 

biological or chemical threat. You need to ensure that there are 

systems in place to protect the public health, and you must use 

every necessary mechanism to ensure an adequate, affordable supply 

of medicines. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under 28 USC 1498 it is clear. You can authorize immediately 

the production of needed medicines. As you and your staff know, 

the U.S. government has used 28 USC 1498 in many cases for less 

serious matters, to authorize contractors to use patents held by 

others in order to provide goods and services for the government. 

This includes cases involving pharmaceutical products, in far less 

difficult circumstances. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bayer, the giant German pharmaceutical firm, currently markets 

ciprofloxacin on an exclusive basis in the United States. Drug 

stores are charging in some cases more than $700 for a two month's 

supply of medicine that can be obtained for as little as $20 in 

some foreign county generic markets, and now it seeks to be the 

exclusive company that can supply 1.2 billion pills to the federal 

government. Bayer stands to make hundreds of millions if not 

billions of dollars in the wake of the September 11 terrorist 

attack on Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the absence of adequate government stockpiles, families who 

cannot afford the hundreds of dollars per month per family member 

for ciprofloxacin risk not having access to this product, should 

the need arise. This is an unethical and unnecessary form of 

rationing. Some government officials and those who can afford 

the high prices have secure supplies of ciprofloxacin. It is your 

duty to see that all taxpayers and especially those who are less 

affluent are protected, and are protected as soon as is possible, 

not as soon as it is possible for one firm, Bayer, to supply the 

market. And it would make sense to have redundant sources of 

supply, for all of the obvious reasons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More generally, you need to be forward looking, should other 

cases arise with similar constraints on the access to medicines, 

and you need to find ways to obtain whatever medicines may be 

needed. You need to provide a framework for acquisition of needed 

medicines, including the steps that will be taken to address issues 

of pricing and affordability. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this review, you should examine U.S. government obligations 

for compensation under 28 USC 1498, to see if there is a need for 

statutory changes that would ensure that firms cannot exploit the 

current situation, or engage in bio-terrorism profiteering. In 

that respect, you are urged to look at models such as those in HR 

1708 which would give the U.S. government the same tools that most 

European countries have to protect consumers from abusive prices, 

refusals to license technologies, unreasonable restrictions on the 

use medical research tools, and other areas of public interest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your official responsibility is to protect the public's health, 

and not to defend large profiteering pharmaceutical companies, 

which are already making a fortune because of our country's current 

problems. How do you define the patriotic choice here? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely, </font></p>
