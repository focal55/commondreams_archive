<font size="2">But Exxon-Mobil 

Profits Show `Crying Poor' Is Bogus

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 23 - The Energy Information Administration, a branch of the U.S. 

Department of Energy, is said to be readying a new attack on 

the Environmental Protection Agency's low-sulfur diesel standards. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Exxon-Mobil's new profit information out today -- showing a 

huge increase in profits in part due to refineries -- may undercut 

any new claim that the oil industry can't afford to clean up its 

dirty diesel fuel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's what we know: By May 4, the Energy Information 

Administration is expected to issue a new analysis of the 

low-sulfur diesel rules issued by the Clinton Administration and 

reaffirmed by current EPA Administrator Christie Whitman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you may recall, some staffers within DOE bitterly opposed the 

diesel cleanup, and it is conceivable that this new, tightly held 

report is the starting gun in yet another effort to agitate against 

the standards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(You may also recall that the Energy Information 

Administration, or EIA, is same agency that did the study cited by 

President Bush as his &quot;new information&quot; reason for flip-flopping on 

carbon dioxide controls. We also know that the Bush Administration 

-- while taking credit for not killing the Clinton diesel cleanup 

-- has winked to the oil industry that it is open to taking another 

look at the diesel rule in the future.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On its carbon dioxide report, the EIA was subject to harsh 

criticism for using flawed assumptions that lead to an 

overstatement of the control costs. We recommend that you closely 

examine the assumptions in the upcoming diesel report. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, the oil industry has been crying poor ever since 

the EPA first noted several years ago that it would seek to clean 

up diesel fuel. The costs will be so high -- so goes the industry 

patter -- that oil companies will close down refineries and that 

will lead to fuel shortages and the resulting Armageddon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Will the energy agency repeat this misinformation -- or will it 

consider new technologies that accomplish the cleanup at a much 

lower cost than previous estimates? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several new lower-cost methods were unveiled last Month at the 

annual meeting of the National Petrochemical and Refiners 

Association. For example, a new process by SulphCo, Inc. of 

Nevada could remove the sulfur from diesel fuel for a mere 2.5 

cents per gallon - only half the cost estimated by EPA and far 

below the even-higher costs projected by the doomsday-sayers in the 

oil industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the industry's alleged poverty, note that Exxon-Mobil 

today reported that its first-quarter profits increased 51 percent 

-- to a whopping $5.1 billion - on the strength of refining margins 

and higher natural gas prices. (It also might be worth thinking 

about those profits when you look at costs at the pump this summer 

and hear the industry blame those awful clean gasoline standards.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will be sure to update you on this energy agency study. </font></p>
