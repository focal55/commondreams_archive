- April 6 - The Congressional Progressive Caucus today hailed the victory of its tax rebate concept today, as the U.S. Senate voted for $85 billion

amendment sponsored by Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC) providing a rebate to

all taxpayers. Two months ago, the Progressive Caucus unveiled and $85

billion rebate plan called &quot;The American People's Dividend&quot; that would have

given $300 to every man woman and child in America. Last night's Senate

amendment modified that concept to provide $500 to every taxpayer in

America. Over the last two months, the Caucus has reached out to Republicans

and Democrats for support for the idea, most recently gaining the support of the idea from Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Budget Chairman Pete

Domenici (R-NM). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive Caucus Member Rep. Bernie Sanders, one of the principal

architects of the plan said, &quot;Two months ago, the Progressive Caucus

proposed a $300-per-person tax rebate and today's passage of this concept in

the Senate brings us one step closer to making that plan a reality. Our plan

was simple, across-the-board and fair. Every taxpayer gets the same amount

of tax relief regardless of income. The plan is also fiscally responsible

because it does not lock in huge long-term tax cuts for the wealthy that

could create major deficits. I am gratified that the Senate passed a version

of this concept, and in the coming weeks, I will be working to make sure

that it becomes a reality so that all Americans get the immmediate tax

relief they deserve.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive Caucus Chairman Dennis Kucinich said, &quot;Unlike President Bush's

tax proposal which gives most of the tax benefits to the very few, the

Progressive Caucus's proposal is fair because it gives every person equal

tax relief . Our plan is simple - everyone, regardless of income, receives

the same benefit. I am gratified that the Senate passed a version of our

plan and the Progressive Caucus will be working as a cohesive unit to reach

out to leaders from all political perspectives who want to see substantial

and truly fair tax relief for all Americans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Progressive Caucus Vice Chair Rep. Barbara Lee said, &quot;I am pleased that our

Senate colleagues are following the lead of the Progressive Caucus in

sponsoring today's budget amendment to give a much-needed per-person tax

rebate. At at time when housing costs are at an all-time high, college

remains a far-off dream for many American students, and prescription drugs

are too expensive for our seniors, this responsible tax rebate will put money in the hands of the American people quickly to meet their needs,

stimulate the economy, and not break the bank like President Bush's plan.&quot;</font></p>
