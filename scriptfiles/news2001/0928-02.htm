- September 28 - A new report on GMO

contamination worldwide shows the urgent need to ratify the

Biosafety Protocol and for liability rules as soon as possible.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth International urges governments at the next

UN Biosafety meeting in Nairobi (Oct. 1-5) to ratify the Biosafety

Protocol and to engage themselves in a fast-track procedure to

introduce as soon as possible a liability mechanism under the

Biosafety Protocol negotiations. The liability issue will be

discussed at the next Intergovernmental Committee for the Cartagena

Protocol on Biosafety (ICCP), where Friends of the Earth

International is also presenting a new report on the impacts of GMO

contamination around the world. The report, entitled, "GMO

Contamination Around the World," gives more evidence about the

impacts of the illegal transfer of GMOs which underlines the urgent

need for a liability and redress mechanism. At the moment no

international and only very few national rules on liability and

redress exist regarding GMOs.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"GMO contamination has become the Trojan horse of the biotech

industry. Without a liability mechanism, the responsibilities for

the damage caused by contamination will more often than not fall on

the victims of environmental, health and economic damages, not on

the producers of GMOs," said Larry Bohlen from Friends of the

Earth, U.S.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discoveries in August last year of StarLink, a genetically

modified maize illegal for human consumption in the food supply in

the U.S. and later in Japan and South Korea underline the urgent

need for a liability mechanism under the Biosafety Protocol. Later

discoveries of GMOs not approved in Europe and Latin America are

described in the FoE report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Liability for harm would also give biotech companies an

incentive to be more careful about the kinds of crops they produce

and how aggressively they are commercialized," continued Bohlen.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The costs of redress and compensation of StarLink, which has

become the widest case of contamination by a GMO not authorized for

human consumption anywhere in the world were estimated to be around

1 billion dollars. A year later, many nations, importers and

farmers are sorting out who shoulders the costs of testing for the

presence of GMOs like StarLink and who pays when contamination

occurs. The lack of an international liability system has

frequently put the burden of the costs of GMO contamination onto

the countries that suffer the contamination.
