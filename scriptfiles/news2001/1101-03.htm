- November 1 - A key Congressional 

Committee passed Halloween legislation yesterday that frightens 

environmentalists and taxpayers, according to Friends of the Earth. 

The bill guarantees heavy government involvement in the nuclear 

power industry and puts taxpayers on the hook in the case of a 

nuclear disaster. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of 

Representatives passed a bill to reauthorize the Price Anderson Act 

for 15 years. The legislation limits the liability of nuclear 

power plant owners for damage associated with nuclear accidents. 

This action comes at a time of unprecedented concern over the 

security of nuclear power plants in light of the airplane attacks 

of September 11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nuclear power came masquerading to Congress as a safe, clean, 

and reliable energy source,&quot; said Erich Pica, Economic Policy 

Analyst at Friends of the Earth. &quot;But the events of September 11 

show that the disguise hides vulnerable, dangerous terrorist 

targets in 103 communities around the United States. If any of 

these facilities were attacked, God forbid, the health and 

well-being of millions of Americans could be at risk.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced a 10 

nautical mile no-fly zone around existing nuclear power plants and 

other Department of Energy facilities. This follows announcements 

by governors in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts 

to deploy National Guard troops at nuclear facilities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The federal government and five governors understand the risk 

of nuclear power plants,&quot; continued Pica. &quot;But apparently the 

Energy and Commerce Committee got a group rate on ostrich costumes 

and is sticking its head in the ground.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) successfully attached an amendment 

to the bill that would require the President to study the 

potentially threats to nuclear power facilities, and mandate the 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take corrective action. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Originally enacted by Congress in 1957, the Price-Anderson Act 

is the largest federal subsidy to the nuclear industry. It limits 

the liability of the nuclear industry in the event of a nuclear 

accident in the United States. The Act covers large power reactors 

as well as small research and test reactors, fuel reprocessing 

plants and enrichment facilities. Price Anderson also covers 

incidents that occur through operation of nuclear plants as well as 

transportation and storage of nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes. </font></p>
