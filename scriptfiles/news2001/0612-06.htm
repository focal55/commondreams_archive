- June 12 - Following is a 

statement by Judith C. Appelbaum, National Women's Law Center 

vice president and director of employment opportunities: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It has been nearly four decades since President Kennedy 

signed into law the Equal Pay Act of 1963, making it illegal for 

employers to pay unequal wages to men and women who hold the 

same job and do the same work. Despite the obvious fairness of 

this simple principle, American women today are still finding 

their paychecks shortchanged because of their sex. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Women still earn, on average, only 72 cents for every dollar 

earned by men. Women of color fare significantly worse. An 

African-American woman earns just 65 cents to every dollar 

earned by a white man, while a Hispanic woman earns only 52 

cents on the dollar. Over seventy percent of American women 

with children are now in the paid workforce, and a growing 

number of single women provide most or all of their families' 

support. These families cannot afford a paycheck that is 

shortchanged just because the worker who earned it is a woman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time to put behind us, for good, any notion that the 

wage gap between the sexes is due to the choices women make 

rather than any real discrimination. Women do not choose to lose 

promotions, to be overlooked for pay raises, or to make less 

money for doing the same job as their male counterparts. Some 

of the wage gap is due to occupational segregation -- the fact 

that women and minorities are still disproportionately clustered 

in lower-paying fields. Numerous studies also show that even 

when women make the same career choices as men and work the same 

hours, they still earn less. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That is why we are calling on Congress to act quickly on the 

Paycheck Fairness Act, introduced by Sen. Daschle and Rep. 

DeLauro and co-sponsored by many others. This bill would close 

loopholes in the existing laws against pay discrimination. The 

bill would, among other things, allow employees to file class 

action lawsuits and recover both compensatory and punitive 

damages. It would also limit employers' ability to assert 

defenses that have allowed them to escape responsibility for 

compensating male and female employees differently. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time -- past time -- to finish the job we started 

almost forty years ago and fulfill the promise of equal pay for 

equal work for every American.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-profit organization 

that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect women's 

legal rights. The Center focuses on major policy areas of 

importance to women and their families including economic 

security, education, employment and health, with special 

attention given to the concerns of low-income women. </i></font></p>
