- April 24 - Joining a growing list of activists, an international coalition of twelve human rights groups sent letters to the four major oil companies attempting to drill on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge-- BP Amoco, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Phillips Petroleum-- urging them to cancel their drilling plans today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Oil companies and other corporate giants are destroying the cultures, livelihoods and the very survival of unique peoples across the world -- from the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta, the Mexicans struggling in Chiapas to the peasants of Columbia and Brazil,&#148; says Abdel-Fatau Musah of the Centre for Democracy and Development, based in London and Lagos, Nigeria.  &#147;Now, the age-old subsistence culture of the Gwich&#146;in is under mortal threat as the oil giants prepare to destroy the Arctic Refuge for a nominal amount of oil.  Enough is enough. Save the Gwich&#146;in people&#146;s culture.  Save their environment.  Save their right to life!&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter calls on BP Amoco, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Phillips Petroleum to &#147;act as a responsible corporate citizen and honor the request of the Gwich&#146;in people to abandon any oil or gas exploration and development plans.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last pristine areas left in the United States.  Caribou, muskoxen, wolves, polar, brown and black bears, and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds rely on the wilderness habitat that the Refuge provides.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Gwich&#146;in, a Nation of Athabascan Indians, have maintained a traditional subsistence way of life in and around the Arctic Refuge for hundreds of generations.  Gwich&#146;in means &#147;people of the caribou.&#148;  The caribou provide food, clothing, shoes, shelter, medicines, blankets, sleds, and tools for the Gwich&#146;in people.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The American public overwhelmingly supports preserving the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  The only interests that would be served by drilling in the Refuge would be Big Oil and policymakers who rely on these corporations for campaign funding,&#148; says Patti Lynn, Associate Campaign Director of Infact, a U.S. corporate accountability organization. &#147;The resolution of this issue will speak volumes about who controls Congress--the people or the oil industry.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signed on to the letters were the Gwich&#146;in Steering Committee, Corporate Watch U.S.A., Mineral Policy Center, National Congress of American Indians, Living Earth, Native American Rights Fund, Project Underground, Indigenous Environmental Network, Global Witness, National Center for Human Rights, Cultural Survival, and U.S. PIRG, in addition to the Centre for Democracy and Development and Infact.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the last three years, the PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign has targeted oil companies that would like to drill in the Arctic Refuge. The campaign has filed five shareholder resolutions and generated more than 35,000 e-mails, phone calls, and letters to BP Amoco, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Phillips Petroleum. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We call on these companies to acknowledge the growing support, from both inside and outside the company, for protecting the Arctic Refuge,&#148; said Athan Manuel, director of the PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign. &#147;It is time for them to act like a responsible corporate citizen, support wilderness designation for the coastal plain, and respect the rights of indigenous people like the Gwich&#146;in.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letters to the four companies can be found on PIRG&#146;s web site  www.SaveTheArctic.com. They will be released at 11:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time, April 24, 2001, during an online news conference and interactive web-chat at www.SaveTheArctic.com. Sarah James, a member of the Gwich'in Steering Committee and Oronto Douglas, Nigerian human rights attorney and environmental activist, will participate in the web-chat.</font></p>
