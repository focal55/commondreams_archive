- May 7 - &quot;The Bush Administration heard the public outcry for protecting our

National Forests, and they have backed off for now from earlier indications

that they would try to repeal these protections.  It's positive that

President Bush is letting these protections stand at least temporarily, but

his decision is far different than mounting a vigorous defense to keep our

unspoiled forests from being clearcut, strip-mined or drilled for oil.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush appears to be retreating from the ring and letting the

timber industry do the dirty work.  Rather than putting up a fight to

defend places where Americans love to hunt and hike, President Bush is

letting the state of Idaho and the timber industry attack these wild

forests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush concedes that Americans want to protect these areas for

recreation and clean water.  Poll after poll, comment after public comment

has shown wide support for saving our last unspoiled forests.  The Bush

administration is afraid to just dump the plan.  Instead, it has taken a

tack where it can claim credit for upholding the rule while allowing the

State of Idaho and the timber industry to gnaw away at the edges until no

protections remain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;During Attorney General John Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, he

promised, under oath, to defend these protections in court.  This plan

should be implemented fully and immediately, and we're on watch to ensure

the Department of Justice fulfills its obligations to the American people.

The real test is the Administration's defense of the plan in the courts and

their enforcement in the forests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans want the last wild areas in our National Forests protected for

our families and for our future.  From the Tongass rainforest to Montana's

ponderosas to Florida's pine forests, citizens calling for wild forest

protection vastly outnumbered those opposed.  People want these forests

saved for hunting, fishing, camping, and providing clean water forever --

not for the profit of a few timber and mining industries.&quot;
