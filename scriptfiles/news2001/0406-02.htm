<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 6 - Environmental groups hailed a federal court's dismissal of

          a major lawsuit filed by the coal industry that had sought to

          silence debate on global warming and impose massive damages for

          the groups' global warming publicity. The lawsuit attacked the

          groups for running a newspaper advertisement in the <I>NewYork

          Times</I> on December 13, 1999, entitled &quot;Global Warming-How

          Will It End?&quot; The advertisement highlighted the causes,

          potential impacts and possible solutions to global warming and

          mentioned &quot;coal&quot; as a cause.

<DT>The environmental groups had denounced the lawsuit as a classic

          SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation). SLAPPs

          are frivolous suits by polluters and developers used to harass

          citizen opponents. The lawsuit was filed last year by Western

          Fuels Association, an arm of the power industry that purchases

          hundreds of millions of dollars of coal annually. The suit named

          as defendants the Turning Point Project, the International Center

          for Technology Assessment, Friends of the Earth, Ozone Action,

          Earth Island Institute and the Rainforest Action Network. The

          lawsuit attempted to establish a new legal precedent by invoking

          the federal Lanham Act, which only applies to commercial speech

          among competitors, in a case involving only political speech.

<DT>&nbsp;

<DT>&nbsp;

          

<DT>The environmental groups learned today that the federal district

          court in Wyoming issued an order dismissing Western Fuels Association's

          lawsuit SLAPP. The opinion by Chief Judge William Downes holds

          that the lawsuit was improperly brought in Wyoming and that Western

          Fuels' had failed to show why the environmental groups, based

          in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, should be sued in Wyoming.

          Western Fuels had contended that any statement in the media connecting

          &quot;coal&quot; with global warming should be construed as an

          attack on the Wyoming coal industry. The court rejected this

          argument, holding that it &quot;does not agree with Plaintiff's

          characterization that the subject of this action is coal&quot;

          and instead held the case to be one about speech.

<DT>&nbsp;

<DT>&nbsp;

          

<DT>The court also rejected Western Fuels' argument that placement

          of the New York Times advertisement on one of the environmental

          group's web sites allowed the case to be filed anywhere in the

          country. The court held that in this emerging area of the law

          &quot;an Internet advertisement alone&quot; is not &quot;sufficient

          to subject the advertiser to jurisdiction in the plaintiff's

          home state.&quot;

<DT>&nbsp;

<DT>Attorney Matthew F. Pawa, of Milstein, Hausfeld &amp; Toll,

          P.L.L.C., Washington, D.C., who represents the environmental

          groups, stated he was &quot;gratified that the court dismissed

          the lawsuit.&quot; Pawa further stated that &quot;Western Fuels'

          lawsuit is an obvious attempt to use a court to harass and intimidate

          citizens concerned with global warming by subjecting them to

          expensive litigation in an inconvenient forum.&quot;

<DT>&nbsp;

<DT>&nbsp;

          

<DT>Attorney Reed Zars of Laramie Wyoming, who also represents

          the environmental groups, stated &quot;The debate over whether

          the earth is flat or round did not need to be squelched by the

          courts. The same is true for global warming. Does it give us

          some idea of where the coal industry believes the global warming

          discussion is headed that Western Fuels filed this case to stop

          the discussion?&quot;

<DT>&nbsp;

<DT>&nbsp;

          

<DT>&quot;The environmental and human health threats of global

          warming are real and serious,&quot; said Dr. Brent Blackwelder,

          President of Friends of the Earth. &quot;We are pleased that

          the court would not entertain a suit brought by polluters who

          want to limit the ability of citizen groups to warn the public

          about these risks.&quot;

<DT>&nbsp;

<DT>&nbsp;

          

<DT>Andrew Kimbrell of the Turning Point Project stated, &quot;At

          a time when the Bush Administration is turning its back on global

          warming, the court effectively has sent a strong message that

          public debate on this critical issue should not be censored.&quot;
