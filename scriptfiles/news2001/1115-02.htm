- November 15 - The city of Columbus is seeking an injunction against SOA Watch organizers.  

The restraining order attempts to prevent the traditional solemn funeral 

procession honoring those who have died at the hands of School of the 

Americas graduates.  SOA Watch has organized a nonviolent presence at the 

entrance to Ft. Benning for the past eleven years, and plans to contest the 

injunction.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The City of Columbus is attempting to engage in prior restraint in denying 

citizens rights to free speech and free assembly,&quot; said Katya Komisaruk, an 

attorney representing one of the four defendants, &quot;The Founding Fathers put 

freedom of speech and assembly at the top of our Bill of Rights.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four defendants Fr. Roy Bourgeois, Jeff Windor, Eric LeCompte, Ken &quot;Doe&quot; 

are to appear in the superior court of Muscogee County at 3pm today (11/15).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a large, diverse grassroots movement rooted in nonviolence and 

connected in solidarity with the suffering poor of Latin America who are the 

victims of this school,&quot; said Fr. Roy Bourgeois, one of the four defendants, &quot;We cannot be silenced.  We will not be silenced.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOA Watch, founded in 1990, is a national, grassroots, faith and 

conscience-based group that seeks to nonviolently expose the School of the 

Americas, which was recently renamed the Western Hemispheric Institute for 

Security Cooperation (WHISC).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The October 30th London Guardian stated, &quot;Until January this year WHISC was 

called the School of the Americas or SOA.  Since 1946, SOA has trained more 

than 60,000 Latin American soldiers and policemen.  Among its graduates are 

many of the continent's most notorious torturers, mass murderers, dictators 

and state terrorists.&quot;</font></p>
