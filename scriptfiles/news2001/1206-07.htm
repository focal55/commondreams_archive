- December 6 - Sarah Brady, Chair of the 

Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following 

statement today in response to this morning's front-page article in 

The New York Times about Attorney General John D. Ashcroft's 

decision to bar the FBI from checking records to determine whether 

any of the 1,200 people detained after Sept. 11 terrorist attacks 

had bought guns. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;John Ashcroft's decision to prevent the FBI from checking gun 

records is proof of what we have said since he was first nominated 

to become Attorney General: he is beholden to the gun lobby and he 

places his allegiance to them above the best interests of the 

United States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since Sept. 11, the Attorney General has resolutely sought new 

and sometimes controversial measures to track possible terrorists 

in the United States - from detaining and questioning immigrants, 

to monitoring lawyer-client conversations of suspected terrorists 

and relaxing the F.B.I.'s 25-year-old guidelines barring 

surveillance of religious and domestic political groups. Yet 

today's article clearly points out the one area where the Attorney 

General has not been aggressive in the battle against terrorism: 

using and strengthening our nation's gun laws to capture these 

terrorists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is absurd that he would use every possible tool to 

investigate these suspects, except using existing records to 

determine whether they bought guns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;He contends that current law bars the use of background check 

records in law enforcement investigations, citing privacy concerns. 

But that is in direct contradiction to what FBI officials have 

said: that it is permissible to check the records if someone who 

had been approved to buy a gun should not have been allowed to, 

including immigrants who are not permanent residents or citizens. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;FBI and other law enforcement officials are dumbfounded and 

frustrated by this outrageous roadblock. How can they be expected 

to protect homeland security when the Attorney General strips them 

of critical tools they need and have specifically requested? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And if the Attorney General truly believes the FBI is 

prohibited from using these background check records, why didn't he 

seek to change that in anti-terrorism legislation he recently 

proposed? How can he justify allowing such a serious restriction on 

the FBI's investigative powers? 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When pressed on this point by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 

at a hearing this morning on whether he would propose legislation 

specifically granting this authority to the FBI, Mr. Ashcroft 

evasively replied: 'I won't comment on any specific legislation in 

the hypothetical. I'd be happy to consider any legislation that you 

would propose.' </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Amazingly, the one gun law proposal that Mr. Ashcroft has made 

-- to destroy the background check records after 24 hours instead of 

the current 90 days -- would weaken our nation's firearms laws and 

deprive law enforcement of an important resource. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Attorney General should use and seek every possible tool to 

determine whether potential terrorists have been obtaining weapons 

in the United States. Our national security demands it.&quot; </font></p>

<p></p>
