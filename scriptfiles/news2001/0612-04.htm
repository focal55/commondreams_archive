- June 12 - A group of 50 organizations today sent a letter opposing the McCain-Lieberman gun show bill [S. 890] to every member of the U.S. Senate [letter attached]. Warning that the bill would open more loopholes than it would close, the groups&#151;including Consumer Federation of America, Violence Policy Center, NAACP, Children's Defense Fund, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, National Network to End Domestic Violence, and Physicians for Social Responsibility&#151;asked the Senators to oppose the bill. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The McCain-Lieberman &#145;compromise' bill is not better than nothing&#151;in fact it's worse,&quot; the groups wrote in their opposition letter today. Opposition to the bill includes the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an organization in Senator Lieberman's home state. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The McCain-Lieberman bill sets weaker standards for unlicensed individuals versus licensed dealers by shortening background checks for unlicensed dealers from three business days to 24 hours if certain conditions are met. In the letter, the groups point out that there is absolutely no basis whatsoever to treat gun sales at gun shows differently depending on whether the seller is licensed or unlicensed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Indeed, the desire to treat all sales the same is precisely the reason for closing the gun show loophole in the first place. This approach misses the forest for the trees,&quot; the groups stated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the McCain-Lieberman bill reduces the time for law enforcement to do adequate background checks. The 24-hour provision allowed for unlicensed sales would not provide enough time to stop sales to felons. Since many gun shows take place on the weekends, when state and local law enforcement offices are closed, the information necessary to complete a background check would not be accessible within 24 hours. This bill would effectively draw more criminals to unlicensed individuals who sell at gun shows. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the letter, the 50 organizations encouraged the Senators to support the one bill that actually closes the gun show loophole: The Gun Show Background Check Act [S. 767], sponsored by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The undersigned organizations oppose the Gun Show Loophole Closing and Gun Law Enforcement Act of 2001 (S. 890), sponsored by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) because it would open more loopholes than it would close. We ask that you oppose S. 890 and instead give your support to The Gun Show Background Check Act (S. 767)&#151;the only bill that will effectively close the deadly gun show loophole. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The McCain- Lieberman &quot;compromise&quot; bill is not better than nothing&#151;in fact it's worse: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The McCain-Lieberman bill sets weaker standards for unlicensed individuals versus licensed dealers. The McCain-Lieberman bill would shorten the background checks for sales by unlicensed sellers from 3 business days to 24 hours if certain conditions are met. This approach misses the forest for the trees. There is absolutely no basis whatsoever to treat gun sales at gun shows differently depending on whether the seller is licensed or unlicensed. Indeed, the desire to treat all sales the same is precisely the reason for closing the gun show loophole in the first place. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

The McCain-Lieberman bill reduces the time for law enforcement to do adequate background checks. The 24-hour provision allowed for unlicensed sales would not provide enough time to stop sales to felons. Since many gun shows take place on the weekends, when state and local law enforcement offices are closed, the information necessary to complete a background check would not be accessible within 24 hours. This bill would effectively draw more criminals to unlicensed individuals who sell at gun shows. In operation, it may sell more guns but it would put the public at risk. <br>

Keep it simple. There's already a bill to close the gun show loophole that will do the job. The Gun Show Background Check Act (S. 767), sponsored by Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), simply extends existing federal law that applies to sales by licensed dealers to include all sales at gun shows. Most importantly, this legislation allows law enforcement up to three business days to complete background checks. The three business day provision must be preserved for all sellers at gun shows&#151;anything less will be a windfall for criminals and a nightmare for law enforcement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We ask that you oppose S. 890 and support S. 767&#151;the only bill that will effectively close the gun show loophole. We have enclosed several fact sheets for your reference. Please call Susan Peschin, Firearms Project Manager at Consumer Federation of America, at (202) 939-1017 with any questions. We thank you for doing the right thing for all Americans. </font></p>
