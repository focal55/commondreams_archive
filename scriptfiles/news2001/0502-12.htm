- May 2 - Today the Maine Joint Committees of Health and Human Services and Criminal

Justice passed LD 611 by a 15-1 margin.  Although several members were

absent, the final vote is expected to remain overwhelmingly in favor.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LD 611 will create a medical marijuana distribution center Pilot Project.

The center will have a community oversight board, be regulated by law

enforcement, and will be evaluated after 18 months by the Maine legislature.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patients who receive medical marijuana from the center will receive

registration cards identifying them as participating patients.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advocates and members of the committee who supported the bill stated that

the distribution center is the next step in implementing the will of the

voters as expressed in the Referendum that Maine voters passed

overwhelmingly in 1999.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While the medical marijuana law made it legal for patients to possess and

grow small amounts of medical marijuana for personal use, it did not address

the issue of access.  The distribution center will provide a safe and

controlled system, eliminating the need for patients to go to the black

market for their medicine,&#148; stated Elizabeth Beane of Mainers for Medical

Rights.  &#147;There has also been some concern about informal networks of

medical marijuana distribution springing up in Maine in the absence of a

more regulated system.  A state sanctioned center will be much easier for

law enforcement to regulate and safer for patients.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal to create the Pilot Project contained in LD 611 received

support from a majority of the Attorney General&#146;s Task Force members

including law enforcement, legislators, patients and patient advocates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Health and Human Services and Criminal Justice Committees also voted

unanimously to send a message to Maine&#146;s Congressional Delegation urging

them to support state efforts to make medical marijuana available to

patients.
