<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  - November 2  - The director of Florida's Division of Elections recently voiced

surprise that proposed new standards for counting ballots in the 

Sunshine State &quot;are turning out to be a lot less controversial than 

we thought they would be.&quot; But the relatively uneventful public 

hearings on the proposed new standards -- only four people showed 

up at the first of six hearings in Miami on Oct. 29 -- is likely 

due to the fact that Florida voters have received little or no 

information about the public hearings. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF) expressed 

its outrage over the Division of Elections' failure to notify the 

public of the hearings in a timely fashion. PFAWF urged the state 

Board of Elections to better publicize the remaining hearings and 

to consider holding additional hearings to ensure that Floridians 

have ample opportunity to hear about and respond to the proposed 

new standards. The proposed changes are designed to help clarify 

how election officials should interpret voters' intent, an issue 

that was at the center of the Florida presidential vote controversy 

last fall. PFAWF has more than 34,000 members and activists in 

Florida. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are not passing judgment on the new standards that have been 

proposed,&quot; explained PFAWF President Ralph G. Neas, &quot;but it's a 

sham to claim you've received public input when only four people in 

a city the size of Miami show up. After the debacle last November 

that brought dishonor to Florida and its residents, state election 

officials should have gone all-out to inform the public. Instead, 

they seem to be taking a business-as-usual approach.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Florida State Senator Kendrick Meek has confirmed that he was 

not informed in advance of the Oct. 29 hearing in Miami, which drew 

only four people, despite the fact that the hearing was being held 

in Meek's hometown. After learning of the hearing Oct. 30 from a 

small newspaper article in the Miami Herald, PFAWF officials in 

Florida spoke with a Division of Elections employee, who stated 

that officials announced the hearings in an &quot;administrative 

procedure document,&quot; but did not contact the news media. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Friday before these hearings began, a representative of 

Arrive With Five-a nonpartisan voter participation project of 

PFAWF-visited the division's headquarters. There was no notice of 

the hearings posted within the area that is accessible to the 

public. Even as late as this morning, Nov. 2, the home page of the 

Division of Election's Web site (http://election.dos.state.fl.us/) 

made absolutely no mention of upcoming hearings. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Here we are, 12 months after one of the saddest episodes in 

Florida's history, and state election officials are still asleep at 

the switch. They have a duty to alert the public about an issue as 

important as this, and they haven't fulfilled that duty,&quot; said 

Sharon Lettman-Pacheco, the Tallahassee-based state coordinator of 

Arrive With Five. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an Oct. 30 Washington Post article, Division of Elections 

Director Clay Roberts said of the public hearings: &quot;They are 

turning out to be a lot less controversial than we thought they 

would be.&quot; The article noted that the purpose of the hearings was 

to enable state officials to &quot;change (the proposed standards) in 

response to public comment.&quot; The new standards are supposed to 

take effect in January. Future public hearings on the Division's 

proposed new standards are scheduled for Wednesday, Nov. 7 in 

Jacksonville; Thursday, Nov. 8 in Tampa; and Thursday, Nov. 15 in 

West Palm Beach. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Holding public hearings without providing adequate notice to 

the public makes no sense at all,&quot; said Meek. &quot;Haven't Katherine 

Harris and other state officials learned anything from the 

disgraceful events of last November?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 2001, PFAWF joined other organizations in suing the 

Florida Secretary of State, the state's Division of Elections 

director and other defendants on behalf of the Florida NAACP and 

individual African-American and Haitian-American voters. The 

class-action lawsuit challenges election practices and policies 

that disenfranchised thousands of Floridians during the November 

2000 elections. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other remedies, this lawsuit (NAACP v. Katherine Harris) 

seeks the adoption of uniform and non-discriminatory voting 

policies in Florida by the November 2002 elections. The case was 

filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida and was 

assigned to Judge Alan S. Gold. In August, the court denied 

motions to delay or dismiss part of the case. </font></p>
