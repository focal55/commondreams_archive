- June 13 - A balanced energy plan focused on conservation and clean renewable energy sources could do far more to save consumers money and protect the environment than President Bush's National Energy Policy, according to a new study released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Renewable energy sources - wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar - could supply 20 percent of US electricity by 2020, according to &quot;Clean Energy Blueprint: A Smarter National Energy Policy for Today and the Future.&quot; When combined with incentives to improve energy efficiency, the UCS Blueprint would begin saving consumers money in 2010, with savings growing to $43 billion per year by 2020. Next month UCS will release Phase II of its analysis, which will examine additional policies to reduce pollution and make power plants more efficient.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Energy efficiency and renewable energy could replace nearly 1000 of the 1300 new power plants that President Bush says are needed to meet increasing energy needs,&quot; said Alan Nogee, UCS Clean Energy Program Director. &quot;America does not face a shortage of energy supplies, just a shortage of vision, leadership, and determination to provide clean and affordable energy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UCS produced the report by working with the Tellus Institute to examine a package of clean energy policies, including incentives for consumers to purchase more energy-efficient appliances, stricter energy codes for buildings, and requiring electricity providers to obtain 20 percent of their supplies from renewable power sources by 2020. Bush's National Energy Policy did not make any meaningful commitment to increase the nation's use of renewable resources beyond the 2.8 percent in 2020 in a business-as-usual forecast. And while the UCS Blueprint would increase research and development spending for solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources, the administration's proposed budget slashes these funds in half.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report's forecast was developed using the National Energy Modeling System, or NEMS - the same model that the US Energy Information Administration uses to develop long-term forecasts of US energy supply, demand, and prices. The analysis departs from EIA's approach to modeling renewable energy resources, which UCS and others - including the five national laboratories that do energy research - have criticized for including artificial constraints on renewable energy growth.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Clean power can help protect us from price-gouging, artificial shortages, and market manipulation by a handful of energy companies,&quot; said Alden Meyer, UCS Director of Government Relations. &quot;The conservation and renewable policies in the Blueprint reduce natural gas prices and provide consumer savings.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although overall consumer savings from the Blueprint would begin in 2010, a balanced energy policy would start saving money for households through projected lower natural gas prices in 2004 - growing to over $26 billion in yearly savings by 2020. &quot;This would be welcome relief for consumers, who experienced significant increases in natural gas bills in the last year,&quot; said Steven Clemmer, UCS Senior Analyst and lead author of the study.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UCS policy package would also achieve significant reductions in air pollutant emissions. By 2020, carbon dioxide emissions would be 43 percent lower after implementing the policies in the Blueprint. Emissions of both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides would be more than 25 percent below the levels forecast for 2020.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Clean Energy Blueprint takes us a long way toward our goal of reducing air pollution and avoids the need to extract fossil fuels from sensitive public lands,&quot; said Deborah Donovan, UCS Energy Research Coordinator. &quot;This report shows that we can meet future energy demands and still be responsible stewards of our planet.&quot; </font></p>
