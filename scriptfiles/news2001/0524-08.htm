- May 24 - As Americans take to the highways this Memorial Day

weekend, the Sierra Club is calling on President Bush to raise automobile

fuel economy standards. With gas in much of America costing $2.00 a gallon,

an average car owner would save $340 a year in gasoline costs and an

average SUV owner $558 a year if their autos met a new auto fuel economy

standard of 40 mpg.

<p>

"Fuel economy standards were set back in 1975, when today's technology was

just an engineer's dream," Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope noted.

"The beginning of summer driving season is the perfect time for President

Bush to show he is serious about saving oil and saving consumers money at

gas pump."

<p>

Raising fuel economy standards would save Americans money:

* A car at the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard of

27.5 mpg car uses $872 of gasoline each year at $2.00 per gallon. If the

same car got 45 mpg it would save $340 per year. (Based upon the average

driving distance of 12,000 miles a year.)

* The driver of an SUV like the Ford Explorer only gets 19 mpg SUV and

spends $1263 for fuel a year at $2.00 per gal. If the same SUV got 34 mpg

the driver would save $558. (Based upon the average driving distance of

12,000 miles a year.)

<p>

Higher fuel economy standards will also slash the amount of carbon

pollution emitted from cars and light trucks, which contributes to global

warming. The average car emits 6 tons of carbon dioxide pollution every

year, but it would emit less than 4 tons if standards were raised. A more

efficient SUV would emit 4 tons less global warming pollution on average

than today's SUVs.

<p>

"The biggest single step we can take to curb global warming is to make cars

and light trucks go further on a gallon of gas," continued Pope.

<p>

President Bush's Energy Plan recognizes that fuel economy has fallen to a

20-year low, yet calls for a study, not action. With today's technologies

more efficient engines, transmissions, hybrid gasoline-electric systems,

and better aerodynamics the automakers could make cars and light trucks

that go further on a gallon of gas. Congress set the current 27.5 mpg fuel

economy standard for cars in 1975 and has not changed the standard since.

<p>

All savings indicated represent a 40 miles per gallon standard for cars,

SUVs and light trucks. Automakers would meet this standard by building car

fleets averaging 45 miles per gallon and light truck fleets averaging 34

miles per gallon.
