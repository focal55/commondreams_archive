- April 12 -  On Saturday, April 14, 2001, Lieutenant Steve May, an openly gay Republican Arizona State Representative, will complete his term of service in the United States Army Reserves. May faced discharge under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass" for remarks about his sexual orientation made during a debate on the floor of the Arizona Legislature in response to an anti-gay bill.  "May's service directly undercuts the rationale that gays hurt military readiness." The Army dropped the discharge action in January to allow him to complete his service.

<p>C. Dixon Osburn, Executive Director of Servicemembers Legal Defense network said, "The Army tacitly recognizes that it should have never pursued May.  He made comments as a civilian with no real expectation that he would be called back to the active reserves.  And he made those comments in his capacity as an  elected official.  The Army would have had a hard time explaining to a federal judge why the gay ban's reach extended to civilians and elected officials."

<p>May said, "I did what any soldier would do when called back to the active reserves.  I put on my uniform and reported for duty."

<p>Prior to his Reserve service, May served in the U.S. Army's First Infantry Division (from 1993-1995) as a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Officer. Before leaving active duty as a first lieutenant, he served as an assistant battalion operations officer, platoon leader and company executive officer. He is one of very few qualified as a nuclear submariner (Silver Dolphins) and paratrooper (Airborne).

<p>Osburn said, "May's service directly undercuts the rationale that gays hurt military readiness.  May is exactly the sort of soldier the Army should fight to retain.  Congress needs to wake up and recognize the cost of the gay ban to our country."

<p>May, who leaves officially on Saturday, has already finished his final day of duty with his soldiers. "It was tough," May told the Arizona Republic.  "I'm never going to wear this uniform again.  I'm not going to see my soldiers again."
