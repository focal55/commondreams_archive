- February 13 - The Board of Directors of the American Friends

Service Committee (AFSC) has nominated Peace Brigades International

(PBI) for the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. The AFSC was a co-recipient

of the award in 1947 on behalf of Quakers worldwide.

<P>

In its nomination letter, AFSC highlighted Peace Brigades International's

mission statement, which says in part: &quot;PBI has for more

than twenty years work[ed] to open a space for peace in which

conflicts can be addressed in a nonviolent way. PBI applies a

strategy of international presence and concern that supports local

initiatives and contributes to developing a culture of peace and

justice&#133;.&quot;

<P>

PBI's volunteer unarmed bodyguards from countries throughout the

world provide &quot;protective accompaniment&quot; for human rights

workers and others in regions of conflict. They offer international

awareness and nonviolent protection to local workers for peace

and human rights through independent observation and analysis

of the conflict situation. PBI volunteers also conduct peace education

training on request. 

<P>

Currently, Peace Brigades International's largest project of 30

international volunteers is in Colombia accompanying local human

rights workers and civil society organizations working for a peaceful

solution to Colombia's conflicts. In Haiti, PBI is providing peace

education training at the request of Haitian civil society organizations.

New projects are underway in East Timor/Indonesia and in Mexico.

PBI also participates with other organizations in the Balkans

Peace Teams and in SIPAZ, an international coalition of organizations

working in Chiapas, Mexico. 

<P>

The volunteers in the field are supported by PBI's fourteen Country

Groups in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The

Country Groups recruit and support volunteers and organize an

international network of cooperating organizations and governments

to keep a protective watch on volunteers and local human rights

workers threatened with death. Wherever possible, PBI works with

all parties to a conflict in order to establish and inform the

parties of PBI's presence.

<P>

Previously, Peace Brigades International worked in Guatemala,

El Salvador, Sri Lanka, and in North America on violence involving

native peoples.

<P>

In making the nomination, the AFSC Board of Directors also noted

that:

<P>

1. PBI has a sustained, deep commitment to nonviolence in working

for peace and human rights and provides a successful model for

how ordinary people with extraordinary courage can support local

workers for peace in some of the most dangerous of the world's

conflicts.

<P>

2. PBI's extraordinary record of accomplishment is powerful proof

that nonviolence and peaceful approaches to human rights and

social change can work when supported by the international community.

In more than twenty years of work in some of the world's most

violent conflicts, no-one under PBI protection was killed while

they were being protected, nor have any PBI volunteers been killed.



<P>

3. The work is important. The projects where PBI is currently

working, Colombia and Indonesia, are extremely important regional

conflicts, as is the cooperative work PBI volunteers support in

the Balkans and in Chiapas. 

<P>

4. PBI has received the Aachen Peace Prize from the Foundation

for Peace in Aachen, Germany, and was a finalist for a Hilton

Foundation award. It was honored by the international community

in Colombia for the work it has done there, but, PBI has not received

as much international attention as its work warrants. The recognition

provided by a Nobel Peace Prize would greatly enhance their ability

to work in conflict situations.

<P>

5. Peace Brigades International is well known to Quakers. Individual

Friends (Quakers) were deeply involved in PBI's original formation,

and have been involved over the years as PBI staff, volunteers,

and donors. Its mission, program, and methodology are compatible

with the high honor of the Nobel Peace Prize.

<P>

<P>

<I>The American Friends Service Committee

is a Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths

who are committed to social justice, peace, and humanitarian service.

Its work is based on the Quaker belief in the worth of every person

and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice.
