- December 6 - Last night San Jose City Council Members, scientists, policymakers and the public gathered to discuss the urgent need to reduce our contribution to global warming. Prominent global climate change scientist Stephen Schneider called for action, saying that we now know that human activities are dangerously altering the planet&#146;s climate and we should be making smart decisions to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. &quot;Fortunately, there are many cost-effective and sensible things we can do to slow global warming and provide benefits at the same time. Finding win-win solutions should be our focus,&quot; said Schneider.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main focus of the meeting was transportation&#146;s contribution to global warming. In California transportation is responsible for 57 percent of the greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, or more than200 thousand tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere per year. Russell Long, Executive Director of the Bluewater Network, said, &quot;Transportation has been going in the wrong direction for many years and is now the largest culprit behind the state&#146;s greenhouse gas pollution. It&#146;s time to turn this around with bold state leadership.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rod Diridon, Executive Director of the Mineta Transportation Institute said, &quot;The single biggest contributor to global warming is the internal combustion engine which must be controlled to avoid a major climatological disaster for life as we know it on Earth.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is clear from last night&#146;s meeting that global warming is not just an environmental problem, it is an issue that will have severe health and economic consequences for generations to come. Physician Robert Gould, President of the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility stressed the public health dangers of continuing to ignore the global warming. Robin Brack, Advisory Engineer and for IBM, spoke of the company&#146;s commitment to reducing global warming gases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The town hall meeting comes on the heels of a decision by the San Jose City Council on Tuesday to support a landmark state bill to regulate greenhouse gas pollution, Assembly Bill 1058 (Pavley, D-Woodland Hills). AB 1058 would for the first time in US history require the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. &quot;With this bill, California can show the rest of the nation that it is possible to protect the environment while maintaining a sound economy,&quot; said City Council Member Linda LeZotte.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The town hall meeting was sponsored by Bluewater Network, Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, California League of Conservation Voters, and the Loma Prieta Sierra Club Chapter. </font></p>
