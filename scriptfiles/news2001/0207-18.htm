- February 7 -  Following a shooting

incident at the edge of the White House grounds today and an office

shooting in Illinois on Monday, Handgun Control called on the Bush

Administration to show leadership on the gun issue.

<p>Michael D. Barnes, President of Handgun Control said today,

"This nation has just witnessed two high-profile incidents

involving guns in the past three days -- one of which ended

tragically in the deaths of five people, the other involving a man

with a gun just outside the President's own backyard. Our sympathy

goes out to the families of the victims and the survivors of these

tragedies."

<p>"Every day in this nation, 80 people die from gunfire," Barnes

continued. "This Administration claims to want to reduce the

level of gun violence in this country. Both our new Attorney

General, John Ashcroft, and President Bush have stated for the

record that they want to enforce the gun laws on the books.

Now is their chance to back their words with deeds. The nation

is waiting."

<p>Yesterday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer was asked about

the massacre at the Navistar plant in Illinois. In that shooting,

the gunman possessed several firearms, despite the fact that he had

been twice convicted of a felony. When asked what the President

had to say about the incident, Fleischer seemed at a loss as to

what steps could be taken. Instead, he concentrated on the

President's support for trigger locks, while reiterating support

for keeping guns off school grounds, for the assault weapons ban,

and for federal penalties for gun crimes.

<p>"As Mr. Fleischer noted, no law can stop every single shooting,

but does that mean we have done all that we can? Of course not,"

said Barnes. "Now is the time for President Bush to step

forward and do more than simply talk about 'enforcing the laws on

the books.' All the enforcement in the world won't help if our

laws are full of loopholes and our enforcement agencies are

hamstrung by lack of support. We need to require background checks

on all gun sales. We need comprehensive tracing of crime guns to

find their source. We need better record-of-sale information to

enable law enforcement to identify criminals who may have guns,

like the Illinois shooter, and to catch gun traffickers. There are

concrete steps that this President can take to make enforcement of

our gun laws swift and effective, beyond simply giving out trigger

locks."

<p>Ironically, a front-page story in today's Washington Post

reports that most gun locks -- including hundreds of thousands

given away by the gun industry -- have come under fire from the

Consumer Product Safety Commission for failing safety tests.

<p>"There are no federal safety standards for trigger locks, just

as there are none for guns -- another area in which the Bush

Administration could show leadership," said Barnes. "Clearly,

guns and gun locks should be regulated in the same manner as all

other consumer products."

<p><i>Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by

Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun

violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law

enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across

the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun

control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has over

500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it the nation's

largest citizens' gun control lobbying organization. More

information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to

Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our Web site at
