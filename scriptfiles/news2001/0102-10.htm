- January 2 - We are extremely disappointed and disturbed at the nomination by President-elect 

          Bush of Linda Chavez for secretary of labor.

<P> It is an insult to American working men and women to put an avowed 

          opponent of the most basic workers' rights in charge of enforcing the 

          federal laws and regulations that protect workers' wages, employment 

          and pension rights, equal employment opportunity and other programs 

          for advancement. </P>

        <P> As the appointed director of the Commission on Civil Rights in the 

          Reagan administration, Linda Chavez favored terminating the commission 

          and opposed working family advancement programs for women and minorities. 

          She has been a vociferous and aggressive opponent of the federal minimum 

          wage. And she is a strenuous foe of anti-discrimination measures including 

          affirmative action&#151;notwithstanding the secretary's responsibility 

          to manage the largest anti-discrimination and affirmative action program 

          in the country covering 26 million employees of federal contractors 

          (22 percent of the total civilian workforce). </P>

        <P> Taken together with the nominations of John Ashcroft and Gale Norton, 

          the tapping of Chavez sounds a noisy alarm about President-elect Bush's 

          intended stewardship of civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights 

          and the environment. </P>

        <P> The record of Linda Chavez stands in stark contrast to the agenda 

          that won the support of a majority of Americans voting in the November 

          elections&#151;an agenda that responds to the real concerns of our nation's 

          working families. That agenda&#151;grounded in respecting work and strengthening 

          family&#151;will guide our continuing struggle to assure working men 

          and women a voice in their nation's government.
