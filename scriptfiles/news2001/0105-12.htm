- January 5 - At tomorrow's joint session of Congress to count electoral

votes in the presidential election, Florida Congressman Peter

Deutch will call for a quorum. This action will reveal the lack

of a majority of either house of Congress. The Republican House

and Senate leadership has told their members that their

attendance is not required. "The Republicans are trying to make

this regular order, meaning just normal and routine business of

the Congress. But this is the final stage of the closest

election in American history. Far too many bizarre things

happened in Florida for this to be a regular and routine session

of Congress. We need to show the Republicans in Congress that we

do not consider this moment to be regular or routine at all."

<p>To succeed, Deutch needs one member of the Senate to join him

in his call for a quorum. Several Senators who are not willing

to co-sponsor a challenge to Florida's electoral votes have

expressed interest in supporting this procedural measure.

<p>Democrats.com, the largest independent community of

Democratic voters and activists, applauds Congressman Deutch's

efforts. "We call upon our members and all Democrats to

immediately contact their Senators and ask them to support

Congressman Deutch's quorum call tomorrow," said Democrats.com

co-founder David Lytel. "We hope that the Senators agree that

this historic electoral college vote is not to be dismissed as

the routine business of the Congress, as it is being treated by

the Republicans."

<p>The Congressional Black Caucus went on record yesterday in

favor of a challenge to Florida's electoral votes, citing

massive irregularities, fraud and official misconduct.

<p>"With the additional time we believe we can prove to the

American people and the Congress beyond any reasonable doubt

that fraud, intimidation, official misconduct and a conspiracy

to suppress voter turnout through illegal methods were used to

secure Florida's electoral votes for George W. Bush," said

Democrats.com co-founder Bob Fertik.

<p>As Congressman Alcee Hastings said, "It is our duty as

members of the Congressional Black Caucus to publicly

acknowledge our strong opposition to the acceptance of the

presidential electors from Florida for Governor George W. Bush.

In defense of Democracy, in defense of every American's right to

vote.... Beyond the court-sanctioned injustices that we

experienced in Florida, let's face it: Vice President Al Gore

won this election. The American people are looking to us not

only for public outrage, but also for leadership. In this case,

leadership calls for courage," Hastings said.

<p>The Members of Congress in addition to Hastings who are on

the record in support of a challenge to Florida's electors are

Corrine Brown (FL), Carrie Meek (FL), Eddie Bernice Johnson, Mel

Watt, Sheila Jackson Lee, Maxine Waters.

<p>A collection of the credible allegations of fraud and

official misconduct by Florida officials -- including reports on

progress in securing the support of a senator -- will be

available on the Internet at <a href="http://www.trustthepeople.com">http://www.trustthepeople.com.</a>
