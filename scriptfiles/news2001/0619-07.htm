- June 19 -  With the Senate scheduled to begin debate today on proposals for a patients' bill of rights, there were news reports this morning that Republican leaders will seek a delay.

Meanwhile, some medical policy critics contend that the proposed Senate measures are too narrow in scope.

National coordinator of Physicians for a National Health Program, Young said today: "The heart of our problem is the takeover of health care by corporate interests. Having

the right to sue an HMO is an attempt to seek justice after the HMO has

inflicted the harm. But we have to stop the harm. We have an urgent need to

establish universal coverage, like Medicare for all. We spend almost twice as

much as the next country -- $4,200 per capita -- despite the fact that 42

million people in the U.S. have no insurance and 50 million have poor

insurance. Switzerland spends $2,400, Germany spends $2,300, France spends

$2,200, Canada spends $2,000 per person. Each of these countries covers the

entire population, has higher patient satisfaction and has better health

indices, like life expectancy, infant mortality and freedom from preventable

diseases."

Court, executive director of the California-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, is co-author of <I>Making a Killing: HMOs and the Threat to Your

Health</I>. He said today: "A federal patients' bill of rights deserves

a second look, especially a look in the direction of California, which has the

strongest patients' rights laws in the nation. The White House claims that the

Kennedy-McCain bill benefits lawyers, not patients, because it would allow

patients the right to sue HMOs for as much in damages as is allowed under state

law against other industries, instead of capping damages at a lower level. In

fact, California's right-to-sue law has been in effect since January and,

despite the unlimited damages it provides for, there has not been a single

lawsuit filed. Instead, HMOs appear to be deferring more to patients' requests

for treatment, according to the first data to emerge from the state's HMO

regulator."

Friedman is chair of Vote Health, an organization based in Oakland, Calif., working locally to improve health care access and quality. She said today: "We can't get

excited about tweaking the regulation of HMOs -- it's a bit like rearranging

deck chairs on the Titanic. Health care in this country is in grave crisis,

with the regular cutbacks and closings of county health care 'safety nets.'

Growing numbers of uninsured and under-insured rely on emergency rooms for

their health care needs, and treatment of illness places a huge financial

burden on people that takes them years to recover from. The most fundamental

patient right is access to care, but until we have a government-sponsored

single payer health care fund, this is a right denied to millions in the

wealthiest country on the planet."
