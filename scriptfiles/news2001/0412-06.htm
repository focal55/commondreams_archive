- April 12 - &quot;The Sierra Club strongly opposes efforts to prematurely move nuclear waste

through the state of Illinois before a permanent plan for its disposal is

in place.  Nuclear waste is among the most dangerous substance humans have

created and must be handled responsibly.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club opposes an irresponsible policy that puts nuclear waste on

the roads and rails of Illinois, exposing children and families throughout

the state to the dangers of this waste.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Representative Mark Kirk's (R-IL 10) announcement today could throw open

the doors of Illinois to convoys of trucks traveling through Illinois

carrying radioactive waste from other states, if other Representatives

follow suit. Because major roads from eastern states leading to the unsafe,

proposed Yucca Mountain, Nevada, waste site pass through Illinois, the U.S.

Department of Energy has estimated that 36,300 truck shipments of spent

reactor fuel could pass through Illinois on its way west.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The waste at the Zion reactor should not be moved until the nation has

developed a permanent disposal plan.  While the United States needs a

long-term solution, rushing to move the waste now could jeopardize more

Americans in the future if the final plan requires the waste to be

transported once again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The waste can and must be safely and securely stored at the Zion reactor

where it was generated.  Sierra Club looks forward to working with

Representative Kirk and the other members of the Illinois delegation to

pursue the immediate solution of ensuring that the waste at the Zion

reactor is appropriately stored to protect the citizens of Illinois and

Lake Michigan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The problems raised by today's call for moving nuclear waste highlight the

irresponsible nature of President Bush's proposals to reinvest in nuclear

power.  The president's plan will only generate more waste, put more

Americans at risk, and increase costs without significantly affecting our

power supply.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Representative Kirk is right to be concerned about nuclear waste, but his

proposal poses greater risks to the people of Illinois than does ensuring

safe storage at the reactor site.&quot;</font></p>
