- July 16 - This week, President 

Bush is sending top Administration officials out into the 

heartland to drum up support for his floundering energy 

initiatives. Americans are rightly concerned that the 

President's plan is long on drilling and refining and short on 

energy efficiency, renewable technologies and economic 

opportunity. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Administration is peddling the short-sighted energy 

plan as vital to the survival of our economy. This couldn't be 

further from the truth,&quot; said Susanna Drayne, coordinator of the 

Sustainable Energy Coalition. &quot;A key component of economic 

growth is investment in technologies that will generate jobs 

without degrading the environment.&quot; Increased fossil fuel use 

leads to a net reduction in employment in the United States 

because of the relatively low labor intensity of the energy 

supply industries compared to other sectors of the economy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration's focus on building new power plants 

and drilling for more oil will not solve the nation's energy 

problems alone. &quot;Both building and drilling take years until 

they yield an energy supply,&quot; Drayne noted. &quot;Faced with the 

nation's current immediate energy needs and worsening global 

warming, now is not the time for the Administration to cut 

funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. 

Slashing investment in clean energy at this point is not only 

self-defeating, it's irrational. This plan is unbalanced and out 

of step with the American public, which may explain why the 

Administration is scrambling so hard to sell it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sustainable Energy Coalition brings together more than 30 

national business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy 

organizations. Founded in 1992, the Coalition promotes increased 

federal support for energy efficiency and renewable energy 

technologies and reduced federal support for unsafe or polluting 

energy resources. Coalition members advocate federal energy 

policies that will lead to a cleaner environment, safe reliable 

energy technologies, and a secure, prosperous future for all 

Americans. </font></p>
