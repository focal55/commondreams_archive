<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- January 17 - In the 11th hour of the Clinton Administration, Department of Interior (DOI) officials are attempting to gut a landmark California water reform law, guaranteeing that taxpayers will continue to subsidize water for agriculture interests for the next 25 years at bargain basement prices.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before 

                    they leave office, Administration officials are poised to 

                    sign the first 50 of 200 water contracts that will guarantee 

                    that agricultural interests in the Central Valley will continue 

                    to receive cheap, federally subsidized water - making it virtually 

                    impossible to pay back the billions they owe the federal taxpayers. 

                    The first 50 water contracts are being subsidized to the tune 

                    of $290 million by the federal taxpayer, according to an analysis 

                    by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a national budget watchdog 

                    organization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 

                    failure of the Clinton Administration to fully implement these 

                    pricing reforms will mean hundreds of millions of taxpayer 

                    dollars will be wasted,&quot; said Jonathan Randall, coordinator 

                    of the California Water Project at Taxpayers for Common Sense 

                    (TCS). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Central 

                    Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), which has been hailed 

                    by many as &quot;the most sweeping reform of California water 

                    policy in a half century,&quot; was signed into law days before 

                    the 1992 elections. Senator Bill Bradley, D-NJ, and Rep. George 

                    Miller, D-Martinez, co-sponsors of the bill, consider this 

                    one of their greatest achievements. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fundamental 

                    taxpayer protections of the CVPIA were water pricing reform 

                    and shorter-term contracts. These provisions were intended 

                    to reduce the federal subsidy, encourage water conservation, 

                    and allow for more frequent public review to address California's 

                    changing water needs. As the proposed contracts are currently 

                    written, however, water pricing reforms will be ineffective, 

                    and the contracts will all but guarantee an additional 25-year 

                    extension, effectively making them 50-year contracts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a recent 

                    letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, nine taxpayer 

                    and environmental advocacy groups argued, &quot;the policy 

                    that was intended to encourage the wise use of water and/or 

                    raise funds for environmental 

                    remediation will be rendered all but meaningless in the proposed 

                    round of contracts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In 

                    recognition of the constantly evolving needs of California's 

                    diverse set of water users, it seems unwise to simply guarantee 

                    contract renewal without clear accountability on the part 

                    of the water contractor, a rigorous public review process, 

                    and thorough analysis of California's water needs in the future,&quot; 

                    the activist letter continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Central 

                    Valley Project (CVP) is the largest federal water project 

                    in the United States, delivering enough water to supply every 

                    household in the state of New York for a year. Ninety percent 

                    of the water from CVP's 20 dams and reservoirs, 11 power plants, 

                    and 500 miles of major canals and aqueducts is allocated to 

                    agriculture. The CVP has cost federal taxpayers over $3.6 

                    billion dollars since the late 1930's. Water users have paid 

                    back less than14% of that sum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By 

                    continuing to receive dirt cheap water contacts, it is virtually 

                    impossible for water users to pay back what they owe taxpayers,&quot; 

                    continued Randall, &quot;They get cheap water, and taxpayers 

                    continue to foot the bill.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first 

                    50 water contracts will also set a terrible precedent for 

                    the more than 150 contracts left to be renewed. If the remaining 

                    contractors receive the same kind of deal, taxpayers will 

                    be liable for about $1.5 billion in interest subsidies alone, 

                    the TCS analysis found.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without 

                    raising the water rates charged to users, the federal government 

                    will be unable to recoup the $2 billion in outstanding debt 

                    still owed to the federal government by the 2030 deadline. 

                    </font></p>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These 

                    contract renewals represent an opportunity for meaningful 

                    and lasting water reform. However, as it stands, we may just 

                    lock ourselves into 50 more years of wasteful water use and 

                    mismanagement,&quot; said Randall. </font></p>
