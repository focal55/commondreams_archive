- April 10 -  The federal budget unveiled by the Bush administration on

Monday is a significant step backward on the environment. It

is riddled with short-sighted proposals that appear to reflect

the administration's emerging bias against fighting global warming,

against taking modest steps to protect America's vanishing animal

species and habitats, and against conserving Earth's natural

resources.

<p>A particularly striking example, because it contradicts a direct

campaign promise, is the proposal to provide only $13 million to

fund the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, a landmark law enacted

with bipartisan support in 1998. That minimal level of funding

would be achieved with money diverted from other international

environmental programs.

<p>"During the campaign, President Bush promised more than once to

work with Congress to fund the tropical forest program at a minimum

of $100 million a year," said Brooks Yeager, WWF's vice president

for global threats. "But now this promising effort to use debt to

save tropical forests has been left high and dry by the very

administration that promised to stand behind it." Earlier, the new

administration abandoned another campaign commitment--to seek

limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas that is a major

contributor to global warming.

<p>The Tropical Forest act, which is up for reauthorization this

year, provides for restructuring debt in countries that agree to

repay in local currencies deposited in trust funds for forest

preservation or restoration. With projects just getting under way

in several countries, the need for funds is increasing, not

declining.

<p>In the same budget, the president proposed a 7 percent cut in

biology programs at the U.S. Geological Survey, a level that Yeager

said would "virtually decapitate" the agency's biological resources

division. And the budget would cut all funding for the National

Biological Information Infrastructure, an innovative effort to

build an integrated data system covering all biological survey

information for the United States, linked to information compiled

by universities and museums.

<p>Pound-foolish provisions such as these, coupled with proposals

to reduce funding for solar and wind energy research while

advocating oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife

Refute, represent ill-advised retreats from the path to a sound

energy and environment future.

<p>"President Bush has acknowledged the threat global warming poses

to the environment. Yet, his budget will only exacerbate this

threat, by slashing important energy efficiency and renewable

energy programs that help curb carbon emissions," said WWF Climate

Change campaign director Jennifer L. Morgan.
