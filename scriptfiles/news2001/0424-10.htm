- April 24 - President Bush today announced the sale of a comprehensive $4 billion arms

package to Taiwan.  Bush's first major arms deal perpetuates a U.S. policy

that contributes to a dangerous arms race in one of the world's most

sensitive regions.  The annual ritual of the President of the United States

reviewing Taiwan's wish list like Santa is the wrong approach to building a

constructive relationship between Taiwan and China.  President Bush should

substitute this lazy approach to U.S. foreign policy in the region with a

pro-active, long-term policy that cultivates reconciliation and stability.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like Christmas, the annual review of Taiwan's arms request provides a

measure of predictability to an unstable situation.  Taiwan submits a

weapons wish list, the administration reviews the request, Beijing howls

with anger, Congress increases its rhetoric, and the President decides

which goodies to put under Taiwan's tree.  The U.S. feels compelled to

respond to China's arms purchases from Russia by providing Taiwan with

sophisticated weapons; this pushes China to enhance its military

capabilities even further.  Unfortunately, this arms race has no end in sight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The over-arching goal of U.S. policy in the region must be to foster an

atmosphere of reconciliation between China and Taiwan.  The U.S. should

negotiate with other weapons suppliers to establish technological and

numerical limits on arms sales to the region.  These limits must include a

commitment not to sell any advanced power-projection weaponry and not to

sell any weapons that further upset the balance of power in the region.

Additionally, the U.S. must focus on those weapons already delivered to the

region.  The U.S. should strongly encourage efforts by both China and

Taiwan to enter into negotiations to remove Chinese missiles in the Taiwan

Straits in exchange for restricting the acquisition of anti-missile systems

by Taiwan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">China's weapons purchases from 1992-1999 total over $20 billion.  Taiwan

has received arms equal to that value in the same time period.  As a

result, two adversaries armed to the teeth with modern military technology

are facing each other separated by a mere 94 miles.  Current U.S. policy,

while predictable, does nothing to rectify this situation.  Rather, it

facilitates a dangerous arms race, which eventually could lead to disaster.

 Despite economic interests and political pressures, this risk should be

enough of an impetus to replace our reactive policy with a pro- active

approach to curb the build-up of sophisticated weapons and promote real

stability.  Until then, see you next year.
