<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- February 1 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Honorable Members

<br>

U.S. Senate

<br>

Washington, D.C. 20510

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Organization for Women

urges you to oppose confirmation of John Ashcroft as attorney general.&nbsp;

Sen. Ashcroft has revealed throughout a long career his commitment to an

extremist agenda that opposes the advancement of women's equal rights,

seeks to end women's reproductive rights, supports continued denial of

equal rights to lesbians and gay men, stands against sensible gun control,

and would seriously weaken civil rights and voting rights laws.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not have confidence in Sen. Ashcroft's assertions that he will

uphold the Constitution and enforce the law of the land diligently and

equally. We do not find credible Sen. Ashcroft's explanations for opposition

to confirmation of Judge Ronnie White and Ambassador James Hormel. We are

convinced that the nominee, if confirmed, will use the powers of this high

office to advance his personal political and religious ideology.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most clearly, Sen. Ashcroft has not demonstrated the commitment to equal

justice that an attorney general must have. Our specific concerns about

this nominee are, as follows:

</font>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*We are concerned that Sen. Ashcroft as attorney general would

fail to effectively enforce the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act,

thereby endangering the lives of doctors, clinic personnel and their patients.

Inaction on the part of the attorney general would further encourage clinic

terrorists who murder and maim doctors, patients and clinic personnel.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;*We believe that Sen. Ashcroft would utilize the office

of attorney general as a powerful platform to further advance the campaign

of harassment and debasement of women who seek to control their own reproductive

lives. This push to reverse a century of gains in women's reproductive

health care, threatens progress toward full equality for women and the

strength of our nation’s families.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;*We doubt that John Ashcroft would vigorously carry out

national policy to combat violence against women and would undermine highly

effective programs under the Violence Against Women Act which have reduced

the incidence of violence between partners by 20% over the last six years

since its enactment.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;*We are certain that John Ashcroft would not provide

necessary leadership to stop the tide of vicious hate crimes against women,

lesbians and gay men, people of color, ethnic and religious minorities,

and people with disabilities.&nbsp; An expanded role of technical assistance

and federal funding to aid local law enforcement agencies is absolutely

essential in countering hate crimes.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;*We believe that John Ashcroft would not enforce the

Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban and that more women and children will

lose their lives as a result.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;*We do not believe that Sen. Ashcroft would seek balance

on, and the elimination of racism, sexism and homophobia from, appointments

to the federal bench. We believe that he would promote judicial candidates

who reflect his own extremist views, rather than fairness in the administration

of justice.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;*We fear an era of heightened racism and discrimination

under an Attorney General Ashcroft who would narrowly interpret civil rights

and voting rights laws and eliminate affirmative action to thwart implementation

of equal opportunity laws.</font></blockquote>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The attorney general has the power to affect a wide range of matters that

could advance or impede women's equal rights.&nbsp; If the Senate votes

to confirm the nominee, the members may be implicitly endorsing a reversal

of the many important steps towards full equality that have been taken

in recent decades.&nbsp; We fervently hope that you will not promote this

retrenchment.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you for the opportunity to share our views.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patricia Ireland

<br>

President</font></p>
