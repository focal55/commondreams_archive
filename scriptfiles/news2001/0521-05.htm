<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 21 - We hate to state the obvious, but sometimes it's necessary. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nonprofit Clean Air Trust today awarded its clean air &quot;Villain 

of the Month&quot; award for May to Vice President Dick Cheney. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Vice President earned this dubious distinction by including a 

provision in his energy plan directing the Attorney General to 

&quot;review&quot; existing clean-air enforcement cases against big-polluting 

electric power plants and refineries. This is without a doubt the 

single worst dirty-air recommendation in the energy plan, which has 

been subject to detailed critiques in the past few days. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would like to focus on this provision, because the Vice 

President appears to be pushing the Attorney General to pardon the 

polluters -- polluters that have been linked literally to thousands 

of premature deaths and pollution-related health problems. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;review&quot; involves lawsuits by the Justice Department against 

more than a half-dozen major electric utility companies accused of 

violating the Clean Air Act. These companies stand accused of making 

major modifications to existing coal-fired power plants without 

installing modern pollution controls, as required by law. A related 

enforcement action is pending against at least one major refiner, the 

Exxon-Mobil Corp. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given that the Vice President has initiated interference with 

ongoing judicial proceedings, we're surprised that there hasn't been 

more of a public outcry. (Imagine if he had announced he was 

directing the Attorney General to review the legal basis for pending 

prosecutions against major crack cocaine distributors?) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In two of the pending cases, involving Cinergy Corp. and Virginia 

Power, the accused companies have announced settlements with the 

government -- each company said it would spend more than one billion 

cleanup dollars to settle the prosecution. Obviously, the lawyers 

for these companies believed the Justice Department had a sound legal 

basis for the lawsuits, or they would not have advised the companies 

to settle. And yet Cheney has instructed the Attorney General to 

&quot;review the existing enforcement actions...to ensure that the 

enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 

regulations.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, neither company has actually signed a final consent 

agreement, and they're not likely to while the Attorney General 

conducts his &quot;review.&quot; Nor will the other big companies accused of 

violating the law, including American Electric Power and Southern 

Company. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA has been given 90 days to review the underlying rules, but 

there is no deadline on how long the Attorney General's review may 

take. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the best of cases, the affected companies will continue 

spewing hundreds of thousands of tons of harmful pollutants, knowing 

that the Vice President has given them a blank check to continue to 

pollute -- and maybe a get-out-of-jail-free card. </font></p>
