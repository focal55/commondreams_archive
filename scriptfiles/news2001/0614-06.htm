- June 14 - In the wake of the United States' removal from the UN's Human Rights

Commission, a new report shows that  the U.S. continues to arm some of the

world's worst human rights abusers, according to the Council for a Livable

World Education Fund.  Human Rights and Weapons: Records of Selected U.S.

Arms Clients details the human rights records of 16 countries, and the

types and amounts of weapons sold to them by the US government. According

to the annual report, 78 of the 151 countries that the US approved for

weapons sales 1999 were found to have serious human rights abuses by the US

State Department that same year.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based solely on State and Defense Department data, Human Rights and Weapons

shows that  despite the United States' stated commitment to improving

democracy and human rights around the globe, it often undercuts this goal

by arming abusive, repressive regimes with weapons used to perpetrate these

abuses.  For instance, the report states that &quot;Haiti, known for its police

brutality and extrajudicial killings, received over $30,000 in riot control

ammunition from the Pentagon in 1999.  That same year, the State Department

licensed U.S. companies to sell over $190,000 worth of ammunition and riot

control equipment to Haiti.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another area of concern raised by the study concerns U.S. training of

foreign militaries, known as International Military Education Training

(IMET).  While not large in dollar value, the human rights records of many

Latin American graduates of the School of Americas, a part of the IMET

program, demonstrates that IMET does not instill respect for human rights

in its trainees, despite Pentagon claims to the contrary.  Of the 16

countries discussed in Human Rights and Weapons, eleven received IMET.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights and Weapons provides data on State Department arms export

licenses, Defense Department sales and deliveries, IMET and other forms of

military aid.  The State Department licensed a record $46.9 billion in

1999, a value almost double that of any previous year.  However, it is

unknown what percentage of these licenses result in actual sales.  Pentagon

arms deliveries totaled $16.4 billion in 1999, and its arms sales totaled

$12.2 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. also exports the rights and the technical data for arms

production.  This manufacturing and technical assistance - the blueprints,

instructions, and machinery needed to build American designed weapons, and

the rights to produce them - totaled $22.7 billion last year.  But, as the

report claims, this could foster human rights abuses as well, &quot;[a]s

developing nations gain the ability to build U.S. weapons without U.S.

oversight, the chances increase dramatically that those weapons will make

it into the hands of human rights abusers and countries that sponsor or

harbor terrorists.&quot; </font></p>
