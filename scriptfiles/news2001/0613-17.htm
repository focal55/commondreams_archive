Columnist for the London <I>Observer</I>, Palast said today: "There's a sense in Europe that Bush is threatening and menacing. He's not viewed as just a buffoon, as he is by

many in the United States. Global warming, Star Wars and the death penalty are

very serious issues in Europe. Bush is not viewed as having the authority to

pursue his policies on these issues since he is widely regarded as having

stolen the election."

An associate professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, Cohn said today:

"The Bush administration, baffled at the exclusion of the U.S. from the UN

Commission on Human Rights, is also miffed that NATO won't agree to the United

States' proposed 'missile defense' plan. Throughout his European tour, Bush

will find consistent hostility to the U.S. refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol,

expansion of its use of the death penalty and insistence on a missile defense

shield. We will hear rhetoric from Bush about a 'partnership' between the U.S.

and Europe. But, as a U.S. Army officer stationed in Bosnia told the Los

Angeles Times, 'The only thing the Europeans need us Americans for is the

leadership.' The United States is dependent on Europe not just for a global

market, but also to host U.S. military bases as a counterweight against Russia,

and as a corridor for the transportation of Caspian oil. But the U.S. jealously

guards its role as sole superpower."
