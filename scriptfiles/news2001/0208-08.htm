- February 8 - The Sierra Club today expressed concern regarding Governor

Davis' new energy plan, stating the details of how the plan work out will

be the true measure of whether we provide energy solutions without

increased pollution.

<p>

"Californians need energy and clean air and water," said Carl Zichella, Regional Representative for Sierra Club. "The devil is in the details of

the plan. We must ensure we have aggressive energy conservation and

efficiency, help get the cleaner power plants on line, and prevent any

increase in air pollution emissions."

<p>

"We can meet our energy needs with sensible conservation and improved

energy efficiency, getting cleaner power plants on line, and more

investment in renewable sources of energy," continued Zichella. "We

shouldn't panic and take actions that increase asthma and pollute our air.

If we act sensibly, we can protect our health and environment, and still

have plenty of electricity. We plan to watchdog the details and

implementation of the Governor's plan to ensure we protect our families and

our future."

<p>

Energy experts in the Sierra Club expressed concerns about Governor Davis'

plan possibly allowing numerous "peaking" plants on line. Before we turn to

peaking plants, we must pursue the most aggressive Conservation measures

possible. We may not need many of these peaking plants. Only the least

polluting  peaking plants should be allowed on line, and then only as a last resort. "Peaking" plants can be up to five times more polluting then

other plants and the current Davis plan could possibly allow large numbers

of these plants to come on line significantly impacting air quality.

<p>

Californians enjoy breathing cleaner air in part because the state has

taken sensible steps to reduce pollution from power plants. For example, in

1981 Los Angeles had 180 days where smog reached unsafe levels; in 1999, LA

had only 42 unsafe days.

<p>

The Sierra Club is in favor of a balanced response to California's shortage

that will increase clean and efficient generating capacity, increase the

supply of renewable energy, and increase the use of energy efficient

technology and energy conservation. California now only obtains 10% of its

power from renewable energy resources like solar, wind and geothermal at

competitive prices.

<p>

Environmental protections are not to blame for the current energy shortage,

and should not be weakened as a result. Environmental protections have not

delayed any new power plants. The Sierra Club did not support deregulation

and has not blocked or delayed any new power plants over the last ten years

-- it is the utilities and industry that have opposed building new

generating capacity, not the environmental movement.

<p>

The California electricity shortage is mainly the result of a flawed

deregulation plan compounded by mistakes made by the utilities. Industrial

power users pushed the state to deregulate California's energy market in an

effort to lower costs. The utilities, to pay off debts stemming from

money-losing investments, made a series of mistakes that intensified the

flaws of California's deregulation plan. The result has shifted the costs

and risks of the new energy marketplace onto the public, even though

industrial users stand to gain the lion's share of any benefits.
