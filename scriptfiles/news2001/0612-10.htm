- June 12 - Concerned that its popular food subsidiary Kraft Foods is suffering through its affiliation with tobacco including the effects of a national boycott targeting Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese, Philip Morris is launching an Initial Public Offering of Kraft stock on Tuesday. Since acquiring Kraft in the late 1980&#146;s, Philip Morris has used the food division to buy credibility with policymakers and consumers-most recently through its image advertising campaign highlighting charitable contributions made through Kraft. Infact, the national corporate accountability organization, has involved millions of consumers in challenging Philip Morris to stop addicting new young customers with promotional campaigns like the Marlboro Man, and to stop interfering in public health policy. Some analysts have suggested the IPO is a precursor to a spin-off of Philip Morris&#146;s food business. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Infact Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey, pressure is building on Philip Morris both inside and outside the company. &#147;Philip Morris has acknowledged that top executives are concerned about attracting, motivating, and retaining qualified employees-particularly in the food division. Tensions are mounting within the corporation. The IPO may just be the tip of the iceberg,&#148; she added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even after the IPO, which includes 16% of Kraft stock, Philip Morris will still control the company. Internal corporate documents released through litigation reveal how the parent corporation has used this leverage. Current Philip Morris CEO Geoffrey Bible once outlined a plan to &#147;use our food companies, size, technology, and capability with governments&#148; to defuse influence of the World Health Organization over tobacco control policies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Endorsed by more than 200 institutions and prominent individuals, Infact&#146;s Tobacco Industry Campaign and Kraft Boycott have become a growing liability for Philip Morris. The IPO comes at a time when the investment climate has cooled for such offerings. Despite an 800% increase in spending on corporate advertising between 1998 and 1999, Philip Morris&#146;s attempts to bolster its public image may be backfiring. A recent Harris Interactive poll found that 16% of respondents familiar with Philip Morris had boycotted its products over the past year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coinciding with the IPO, Infact is organizing a national day of action involving visits to Kraft and Philip Morris facilities around the country. In the Chicago area where Kraft is headquartered, prominent leaders including National Black Expo President Suzanne F. Stantley, US Rep. Janice Schakowsky (IL-9th District) and the Rev. Jesse Jackson have signed a letter that will be delivered to Kraft Foods CEO Betsy Holden, urging her to use her leadership within Philip Morris to end aggressive promotional practices like the Marlboro Man. Actions in every state will include distribution of Making a Killing: Philip Morris, Kraft and Global Tobacco Addiction, a documentary film produced for Infact by AndersonGold Films, and Power Politics, a report detailing how Philip Morris uses its political influence to subvert public health policy from the Czech Republic to the Philippines. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Philip Morris is trying to have it both ways-using Kraft Foods to buy goodwill for its tobacco business while spinning the IPO to investors as a way to get a tobacco free taste of Kraft. But consumers across the country are seeing through the tobacco giant&#146;s public relations maneuvers and demanding real change through the Kraft Boycott,&#148; added Mulvey. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Since 1977, Infact has been exposing life-threatening abuses by transnational corporations and organizing successful grassroots campaigns to hold corporations accountable to consumers and society at large. From the Nestl&eacute; Boycott of the 1970s and &#145;80s to the GE Boycott of the 1980s and &#145;90s to today&#146;s Boycott of Philip Morris&#146;s Kraft Foods-Infact organizes to win! </i></font></p>
