- May 22 - An internal Bush administration review is taking aim at a verification and

monitoring protocol to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which

prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, or use of biological

weapons. The review reportedly concludes that since verification of the

treaty will be extremely difficult, the protocol will jeopardize U.S.

secrets while doing nothing to stop cheaters from developing biological

weapons.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While some of the review's concerns may be legitimate, its wholesale

rejection of the protocol is the latest sign of a growing U.S.

unilateralism. In its first few months in office, the Bush administration

backed out of the Kyoto protocol on global warming, suspended missile

negotiations with North Korea, cut funds for Energy Department

nonproliferation programs that reduce the threat of Russian nuclear weapon

and fissile material stockpiles, appointed a notorious arms control

opponent to the top arms control post in the State Department, and signaled

its readiness to abandon the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to

deploy a costly and controversial national anti-missile system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Arms control agreements such as the protocol to the Biological Weapons

Convention may not be perfect, but that doesn't mean we should abandon them,&quot;

said John Isaacs, President of Council for a Livable World.  &quot;If they are

flawed, then the U.S. should take the lead in strengthening and improving

them.  Instead, this administration seems determined to shrug off its

international commitments,&quot; continued Isaacs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the U.S. Senate rejected in 1999,

has also been criticized as unverifiable, and President Bush cited

verification concerns in refusing to continue negotiations with North Korea

on eliminating its development and export of ballistic missiles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The most effective nonproliferation tools have been multilateral

agreements, quiet diplomacy, and threat reduction programs,&quot; added Council

nonproliferation specialist Steve LaMontagne, &quot;Unfortunately the Bush

administration would rather just spend money on building more weapons,

which will only exacerbate the weapons proliferation problem.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Administration is putting its head in the sand like an ostrich.

Instead of proactively dealing with weapons proliferation, the

Administration prefers to foolishly and dangerously hide behind more

weapons, particularly its ineffective missile defense,&quot; added Isaacs. </font></p>
