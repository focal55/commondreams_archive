- January 23 - “Today I am announcing, after reviewing his record as a Senator and as a public

official in Missouri,  that I intend to oppose former Senator Ashcroft for

Attorney General.  



<p>“The Constitution imposes on the Senate a duty to offer advice and consent on

the president’s nominations. Because I believe the president should have broad

latitude in choosing his advisors, I have voted for many nominees with whom I

have disagreed, sometimes forcefully, on policy or philosophy.  But the Attorney

General has a unique charge as chief law enforcement officer of the nation, and

thus senators have a special obligation to scrutinize his record to determine

whether what he has said and done over the years suggests a capacity for

justice, for dealing fairly with those with whom he disagrees, for being an

even-handed arbiter of the law in cases and policy matters large and small which

will come before him.   



<p>“Many have made the point that not only are John Ashcroft’s policy views far

outside of the American mainstream, they are far beyond what President Bush has

said he supports. His fierce opposition to abortion, for example, even in the

case of rape or incest, goes well beyond Bush administration policy. While

true--and while he often effectively imposed an ideological standard on nominees

whom he opposed--that is not reason enough to oppose him. 

 

<p>“I’ve known John Ashcroft for some time and I consider him a friend.  I

especially respect his religious convictions and the commitment to them that he

shows in his personal life. As I’ve said elsewhere, that such a friend can hold

such harsh views has been difficult.  But while I strongly disagree with him on

many issues, it is his record of insensitivity to minority rights, including

those of racial minorities; and his mishandling of certain nominations that is

most troubling.  



<p>“There is possibly no issue more important to our future than that of racial

reconciliation. But John Ashcroft’s relentless defiance of voluntary school

desegregation plans in St. Louis, which prompted repeated rebukes from federal

courts;  his associations with Bob Jones University and Southern Partisan

Magazine; and other similar incidents in his record raise serious questions

about his judgment on matters related to race.  In my mind, his insensitivity

casts doubt on his ability to serve our nation, which must make healing our

racial divide a priority, in this role.



<p>“Senator Ashcroft’s handling of certain presidential nominations, particularly

his gross distortions of the record of Ronald White as a federal judge, and his

efforts to block gay nominee James Hormel as U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, are

troubling. Whether out of animus, which suggests bias; or out of political

opportunism, which suggests a lack of judgment, I’ve concluded his handling of

these nominees was grossly unjust. 



<p>“Enforcement of federal laws protecting the civil rights and voting rights of

our citizens, the safety of women carrying out their constitutional right to

reproductive services, and many other fundamental rights lies with the Justice

Department. Moreover, the Attorney General’s advisory role in the selection of

federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices, and the right of the Justice

Department to intervene before the Supreme Court means the influence of the

Attorney General will extend far beyond the President whom he serves.  It is

crucial, therefore, that this person be independent and fair-minded, open to

arguments from opposing sides, able to take into account the experiences and

views of others. I regret that John Ashcroft, despite his many admirable

personal qualities, is not the right person for this position.”
