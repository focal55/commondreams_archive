- April 12 - In the attempt to artificially inflate the need for increased military

spending, Bush Administration officials have used spurious statistics and

logic to support their agenda.  The following are some excerpts from a

chapter debunking these myths in the Council for a Livable World Education

Fund's upcoming military spending briefing book.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Declining Military</b> - &quot;<i>The next president will inherit a military in

decline.</i>&quot; -Gov. George W. Bush (8/21/00)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the military power of our Cold War adversary has precipitously

declined, U.S. military spending is currently 95 percent of the Cold War

average.  No other country has the prospect of equaling the U.S. in

military power for decades, and that assumes we do not improve our military

in that time..  China, the only potential U.S. enemy with a significant

military, is decades behind the U.S. in military technology.  Today, our military spending is greater than the combined defense budgets of the next

12 countries, including Russia, China and Germany, and the total spending

of the U.S., NATO, Japan and South Korea is greater than the rest of the

world combined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>GDP Comparison Fallacy</b> - &quot;<i>Defense spending today is lower as a percentage

of GNP than at any time since 1940 -- the year before the attack on Pearl

Harbor.</i>&quot;  Vice Presidential Candidate Richard Cheney (8/30/00)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With his reference to Pearl Harbor, the Vice-President implies that

America's military today is no better funded than it was in 1940, when the

armed forces were small and designed around an isolationist foreign policy.

  This is patently false.  Defense spending as a percentage of Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) has fallen because our economy is strong, not

because our defenses our weak. Our GDP in 1980 was approximately $2.7 trillion.  In 2000 our GDP had increased more than three-fold to $9.5

trillion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Inflated Estimates</b> - &quot;<i>But we do know that the Congressional Budget Office

as a nonpartisan group has indicated they felt a significant increase was

necessary just to maintain current level of capability.</i>&quot;  Secretary of

Defense Donald Rumsfeld (2/14/01)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually, the CBO report assumes that new weaponry will be no more capable

than the equipment it replaces, thus necessitating replacing current

equipment with the newest technology on a one-for-one basis.  In other

words, each $50 million F-15 fighter jet would be replaced by a new $200

million F-22.  However, even the Pentagon claimed that was an shoddy logic.&quot;Nobody is proposing that we purchase new versions of the equipment that

we are using today on a one-for-one basis,&quot; said Adm. Craig Quigley, a

Pentagon spokesman.  &quot;That is in no one's budget proposal that I've ever

seen.&quot;  This one-for-one replacement senselessly drives up the CBO's

estimates.  Citing the CBO report as evidence for further defense spending

is therefore disingenuous.</font></p>
