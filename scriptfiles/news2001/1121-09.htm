- November 21 - "Women's rights supporters in the U.S. and abroad rejoiced at the news that Afghan women marched for their rights in Kabul this week," said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Kim Gandy.  "But while Afghan women were taking to the streets, neither the Northern Alliance nor the U.S. government were taking real steps to ensure their safety and equality in a post-Taliban era." For the first time in more than six years, Afghan women demonstrated for their rights on Wednesday in Kabul. 



<p>"The Northern Alliance stopped the march soon after it started, claiming safety concerns," Gandy said. "That's pretty far-fetched. Could it be that the Northern Alliance can take over the entire city of Kabul and install a new government, but can't guarantee the safety of a few hundred women? Not likely. This speaks volumes about whether these rebel forces have any real commitment to women's freedom."



<p>"The repression of even this small demonstration reinforces our determination that a post-Taliban democracy must include women," Gandy said. "Secretary of State Colin Powell has made some positive statements in this regard, but the New York Times reports to the contrary that administration officials will 'not publicly insist at this point that women be included in talks about a post-Taliban coalition government'.  Imagine . . . the Bush Administration won't even include women in the talks, much less in the government itself."



<p>The administration reportedly cites a concern with 'imposing Western values on an Islamic society,' as the reason for holding back such demands. "This is more than ridiculous, it's based on a false premise," Gandy said. "A May 2001 poll released by Physicians for Human Rights found that over ninety percent of Afghan women and men strongly support women's social, legal and political equality. Only a small minority supports the repression of women."             



<p>"With reports of imminent Taliban surrender in the key northern Afghan city of Konduz, there is increased urgency to determine who will participate in a new Afghanistan government," Gandy said. "If the U.S. remains focused on  negotiating with warlords, to the exclusion of women and men who were part of Afghan civil society, history will repeat itself."
