- January 9 - At a time when the rest of the country is taking a serious 

look at capital punishment Oklahoma tonight at 9:00 PM (CT) will begin 

carrying out the first of 8 executions that will take place over the next 24 

days.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week local leaders and Rev. Jesse Jackson lead a march and rally of over 

1,000 in support of a moratorium on the death penalty in Oklahoma. Tonight 

outside the Governor's Mansion from 5 - 6PM there will be a protest against 

the execution of Eddie Trice, a mentally retarded man. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomorrow, Wednesday, a hearing on an emergency request for a stay of 

execution will be held at the US District Court, the day before the execution 

of Wanda Jean Allen. Judge Tim Leonard will be presiding.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also on Wednesday, an Interfaith Meeting will be held at 6 PM at the Farview 

Baptist Church for a prayer service and to help plan civil disobedience and 

protests. Rev. Jesse Jackson announced today that he will be in attendance. 

15 clergy and moratorium supporters met yesterday to plan what is being 

called "Divine Obedience."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The citizens of Oklahoma are raising their voices and demanding that 

Governor Frank Keating impose a moratorium on execution" said Shanitra 

Mohammed, Coordinator, Save Ms. Allen Coalition, "so that all the cases of 

the inmates currently on death row in Oklahoma can be reviewed.  Even the 

most ardent supporter of capital punishment does not support the killing of 

innocent people, people that did not have adequate legal counsel, or people 

who are mentally retarded."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although much of the country's focus has been on the state of Texas because 

of the high rate of executions Oklahoma is now in a crisis mode.  If all 

eight executions take place Oklahoma will be the highest ranking state per 

capita in the rate of executions in the United States.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the heart of the executions is Wanda Jean Allen.  A women whose execution 

has garnered a lot of attention both locally and nationally.  If her 

execution is carried out she will be the first African American woman 

executed in Oklahoma since 1903 and the first African American woman executed 

in the United States since 1954.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wanda's case represents many of the problems that plague death row inmates 

across the country.  She was represented by a lawyer that had not tried a 

capital case before.  She was also represented by a lawyer who had no 

resources.  He was paid only $800 to represent her in a capital murder case.  

With that kind of money he was not able to hire an investigator, gather any 

background information on her childhood, or obtain medical records, etc.  He 

was only able to basically give her the most minimum of representation.  The 

tragedy of the lack of resources is that her lawyer never uncovered the 

information about Wanda Jean's mental incapacities.  When she was very young 

she was hit by a truck and suffered brain trauma.  When she was 13 or 14 she 

was stabbed in the temple.  She was also diagnosed as a teenager with an IQ 

of 69.  However, the jury never heard any of this.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Wanda's case as tragic as it sounds is only the tip of the iceberg when that 

death penalty is looked at as a whole." said Tonya Mclary, program director, 

National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty "At a time when the President 

of the United States stayed a federal execution, a Governor imposed a 

statewide moratorium, and state legislatures are building in safe guards into 

the criminal justice system such as DNA testing, Oklahoma is speeding up it's 

rate of executions."
