- December 7 - Overcoming  yet again a renewed secret hold by an anonymous

Republican, U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) yesterday succeeded in securing

final passage in the Senate of his Heather French Homeless Veterans Assistance

Act (S. 739).  The Wellstone bill will put the resources in place  to reach the

national goal of ending veterans&#146; homelessness within the decade.  Passage of

the conference report yesterday sends the Wellstone bill to the House of

Representatives for final passage there next week, and then on to the President

for his signature.  A nameless Republican senator had used a procedural tactic

to block the Wellstone bill for weeks &#150; never explaining why &#150;  holding the

homeless vets bill hostage.  Wellstone himself put a block on all GOP

non-emergency legislation and resolutions in response, which successfully

focused the concentration of the anonymous blocker&#146;s fellow Republicans,

resulting in the hold being peeled off.  It is still unknown who had placed the

hold.  Wellstone enjoyed the vocal support of veterans and their service

organizations throughout his bare-knuckled legislative fight to help America&#146;s

homeless vets.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a tremendous and hard-fought victory for America's veterans.  We still

don't know who was objecting to  passage of the bill.  They never came forward. 

But the important thing is that they got out of the way.  It's unfortunate that

I had to break the bill free the hard way -- by holding up other legislation. 

But I think once other Senators realized that I was serious, and all

non-emergency legislation would be stalled in the Senate until we got this done

for veterans, we started to see some progress. The House has already passed a

similar bill, and should act quickly on a final version that can be sent to the

President,&#148; Wellstone said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill, which represents the most comprehensive effort to end veterans

homelessness, expands and improves the Department of Veterans Affairs&#146; programs

for homeless veterans in a number of key areas, including: outreach to veterans

at risk of homelessness; support for VA health care providers to develop

programs to meet the special needs of homeless veterans&#150;the aged, women, the

terminally ill, substance abusers, and those who suffer from Post-Traumatic

Stress Disorder; strengthening the VA transitional housing grant program; and

authorizing homeless vets in vocational rehabilitation programs to participate

in compensated work therapy programs.  The bill will also expand the Department

of Labor&#146;s Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program,  a small, but highly

effective program to assist homeless veterans in finding jobs and to become

self- sufficient.
