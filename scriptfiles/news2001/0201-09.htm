- February 1 - The following is a statement

by Joan Malin, CEO of Planned Parenthood of New York City:

<p>"Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) is dismayed that

the United States Senate has confirmed John Ashcroft as United

States Attorney General.

<p>"John Ashcroft has built a career on being one of the fiercest

opponents of reproductive rights. His confirmation will prove to be

disastrous for women's health and lives. He has labeled Roe v. Wade

a 'miserable failure,' and stated that if he could enact one law,

it would be to outlaw all abortions.

<p>"As U.S. Attorney General, Ashcroft will be directly responsible

for the enforcement of federal legislation protecting women's

reproductive rights. We do not believe that Ashcroft will come full

circle to enforce laws that make abortion safe and accessible to

all women, including federal clinic access laws that protect a

woman's right to choose without fear of violence.

<p>"This election demonstrated that a clear majority of Americans

support a woman's right to choose -- and Ashcroft's

ultra-conservative positions clearly do not reflect the will of the

American people.

<p>"We applaud Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Charles

Schumer of New York for opposing Ashcroft's confirmation. We thank

them for recognizing that Ashcroft's views are out of step with the

majority of Americans and that his public record demonstrates that

he is unfit to be the principal enforcer of federal civil rights

laws, including those that impact reproductive freedom.

<p>"PPNYC will remain vigilant to emerging issues affecting women's

reproductive freedom and access to safe, effective and confidential

care. We will continue to work with city, state and federal

agencies to secure protection for a woman's right to choose."

<p><i>PPNYC's mission is to protect women's reproductive rights and

maintain their access to safe, effective and confidential care.

PPNYC pursues these goals through our state-of-the-art clinical

services, education and professional training, and advocacy. PPNYC

provides birth control; emergency contraception; medical and

surgical abortion services; pregnancy testing and options

counseling; GYN care; colposcopy; STD and HIV testing, counseling

and treatment; prenatal care; social service counseling, and help

in obtaining Medicaid or Child Health Plus. PPNYC has centers in

the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. To make an appointment, call

PPNYC at 212-965-7000. </i>
