- November 14 - ACORN and ACORN Housing Corporation have released a study 

documenting the concentration of subprime lending to minority 

and low-income borrowers. The report analyzes national data and 

that for 60 metropolitan areas, and it looks at both purchase 

and refinance loans. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, 49.9 percent of all conventional refinance loans 

received by African-American homeowners were from subprime 

lenders, as were 26.2 percent of the refinance loans received by 

Latino homeowners, compared to 18.0 percent of the refinance 

loans received by white homeowners. African-Americans were 2.8 

times more likely than white borrowers to receive a subprime 

loan, and Latinos were 1.5 times more likely to do so. Lower 

income homeowners of all races receive a disproportionate share 

of subprime loans. Subprime lenders made 36.47 percent of all 

conventional refinance loans received by low-income homeowners 

in 2000, and 25.5 percent of all conventional refinance loans 

received by low-income white homeowners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subprime loans carry higher rates and fees, and in many cases 

involve abusive features that have come to be known as predatory 

lending. While not all subprime loans are predatory, all 

predatory loans are subprime. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN's report last month 

(<a href="http://www.acorn.org/acorn10/communityreinvestment/reports.htm" target="_new">http://www.acorn.org/acorn10/communityreinvestment/reports.htm</a>) 

showed that minority and low-income applicants for prime credit 

are rejected much more frequently than others. This new report 

shows that minority and low-income borrowers are overwhelmingly 

more likely to receive higher priced subprime loans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new report, titled &quot;Separate and Unequal,&quot; is available 

at <a href="http://www.acorn.org" target="_new">http://www.acorn.org</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report makes clear that legislation is needed to rein in 

predatory practices. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- HUD and the Justice Department need to take action 

immediately to enforce the fair housing act. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Federal Reserve Board, at a minimum, needs to 

implement its proposed rule lowering the HOEPA threshold, and 

collecting APR data on loans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- State regulators need to take action against abusive and 

discriminatory lenders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's a crying injustice when minority borrowers are so many 

times more likely to be pushed into high cost loans. We have 

price gouging instead of fair housing. And it's time for it to 

end,&quot; said ACORN National President Maude Hurd. &quot;HUD and the 

Justice Department need to start enforcing the fair housing act 

against predatory lending targeting. They need to investigate, 

and they need to take action against lenders and brokers who are 

charging minority borrowers more. The Federal Reserve Board put 

out its proposed rule months and months ago. What are they 

waiting for? Every day they wait borrowers in our neighborhoods 

lose their hard earned money, and some of them lose their 

homes.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform 

Now, is the nation's largest community organization of low- and 

moderate-income families, with over 100,000 member families 

organized into 500 neighborhood chapters in 40 cities across the 

country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on 

issues of concern to our members. Our priorities include: better 

housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for 

low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks 

and governments, and better public schools. We achieve these 

goals by building community organizations that have the power to 

win changes -- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, 

and voter participation. ACORN's Web site is at
