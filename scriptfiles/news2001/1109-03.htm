<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  

- November 9 - Caught in a swarm of controversy over questionable business

deals and faulty financial statements that have caused its stock

price to plummet, energy giant Enron announced this week that

the company could be sold to rival Dynegy, signaling the demise

of one of the country's biggest political contributors--and one

of the most generous donors to President Bush.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement comes almost a year to the day after an

election in which Enron contributed more than $2.4 million in

individual, PAC, and soft money contributions to federal

candidates and parties, ranking it among the top 50

organizational donors in the 1999-2000 election cycle. The

company's contribution total for the 2000 elections more than

doubled its political donations in each of the two previous

election cycles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enron has already contributed nearly $173,000 to candidates and

parties so far this year, almost 90 percent to Republicans.

Since the 1989-90 election cycle, Enron has made nearly $5.8

million in campaign contributions, 73 percent to Republicans and

27 percent to Democrats.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, Enron was one of the country's 10 largest

companies and the leading energy broker in the United States.

But in recent weeks the Houston-based energy trading company has

come under fire for entering into business partnerships that

presented possible conflicts of interest for several Enron

executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a

formal investigation into those partnerships.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal government's involvement could create a quandary for

President Bush, who raised nearly $114,000 in PAC and individual

contributions from Enron in 1999-2000, making the company one of

Bush's top donors. Enron also donated $100,000 to the

Bush/Cheney inaugural gala in January, a contribution that was

matched by Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth Lay,

and his wife. The Lays have contributed a total of almost

$883,000 to candidates and parties since 1989, of which 90

percent went to Republicans. They are by far the largest

political contributors among Enron employees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lay is a longtime friend of the president, and was one of Bush's

top contributors during the presidential election and two

gubernatorial campaigns in Texas. Lay, listed by the Bush/Cheney

campaign as a Pioneer who raised at least $100,000 for the

election, reportedly has been one of the administration's

closest advisors on energy policy since Bush took office.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enron hopes to draw on close relationships with a number of

elected officials for help during its current crisis. The

company spent $2.1 million lobbying Congress and the White House

in 2000, an increase over the $1.9 million it spent on lobbying

in 1999. Enron has contributed to the campaign accounts of 71

current senators and 188 current members (43 percent) of the

House.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not surprisingly, the top recipients of Enron's contributions

among current members of Congress are all from Texas. Sens. Kay

Bailey Hutchison (R) and Phil Gramm (R) lead the list of Senate

recipients since 1989. The seven biggest House beneficiaries of

Enron's giving since 1989 are also from Texas. They are led by

Democratic Rep. Ken Bentsen.</font></p>
