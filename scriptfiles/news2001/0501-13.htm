- May 1 - Nearly 300 of the nation's

most pre-eminent scientists joined World Wildlife Fund and other

leading conservation groups today in calling on the Bush

Administration to support and implement the Roadless Area

Conservation Rule.

<p>In a letter sent to the President, the scientists warned of

incalculable damage to nature from the "continuing loss and

fragmentation of the nation's forests." America's remaining

undeveloped national forests play a key role in helping nature to

"withstand the effects of global climate change and...as refugia

for sensitive wildlife," the letter signed by 291 biologists,

ecologists and geologists said.

<p>Following more than a decade of study and more than 600 public

hearings over a two-year period, President Clinton promulgated the

Roadless Area Conservation Rule to protect the nation's remaining

intact forests before he left office last January. During the

exhaustive public debate, more than 1.6 million public comments

were received -- the overwhelming majority of them in favor of the

new rule. Nevertheless, the Bush Administration, siding with the

mining, logging and oil industries, has indicated it wants to delay

the rule and scrap most of it.

<p>"The roadless rule reflects good science and good policy and was

crafted with record-breaking public participation," said Kathryn

Fuller, president of World Wildlife Fund. "We have called upon

President Bush to heed the millions of Americans who want intact

national forests to remain refuges for wildlife."

<p>The letter sent to President Bush represents the scientific

consensus of some of the nation's best known biologists, ecologists

and conservationists including Gordon Orians of the University of

Washington, John Terborgh of Duke University, Stuart L. Pimm of

Columbia University and George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods

Hole Research Center.

<p>"Time and again, the Bush Administration has claimed that its

stewardship of America's natural resources will be based on good

science," noted WWF Vice President William M. Eichbaum. "Today

nearly three hundred leading scientists sent the President a clear

message: the roadless area policy is good for the health America's

forests, wildlife, and people."

<p>More than two-thirds of America's original forest cover has

already been wiped out and all but two percent of what remains is

spider-webbed with 380,000 miles of roads -- enough to wrap around

the Earth 15 times.

<p>The relatively few roadless areas that remain provide crucial

refuge to reclusive and threatened wildlife such as bears,

wolverines, lynx, martens and salmon. They also play an

indispensable role in the function of watersheds and aquatic

ecosystems, reducing flood threats and providing millions of

Americans with clean sources of drinking water.

<p>"The biological, economic, social and recreational benefits of

roadless areas are enormous," Fuller said. "We will all pay a dear

price -- and our children and grandchildren the greatest -- unless

we act now to protect what little intact forest we have left."
