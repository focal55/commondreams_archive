- May 17 - In the energy plan released this week, the Bush Administration has failed in its duty to protect the American people. The plan represents a significant threat to the nation's public health. For example, power plant pollution shortens the lives and threatens the health of thousands of Americans. Instead of dealing with this health crisis, the Bush energy plan would increase the number of plants at an astronomical rate. The plan endorses a myriad of policies and practices that increase health risks. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush energy plan not only ignores the need to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, it takes steps which will essentially increase those emissions over the next two decades. The plan supports the construction of 1,300 to 1,900 new power plants over that period. That comes out to nearly one power plant a week until 2021. These plants are our greatest emission-related health threat. They contribute to ground-level ozone, smog, acid rain, climate change, deadly particulate matter and birth defect-causing mercury. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's fossil fuel habit pumps out 25% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions are the main culprit behind our changing climate, which can lead to increases in extreme weather events, heat waves and vector-borne diseases like the deadly West Nile Virus. A smart energy policy would address this growing US and world health problem; the Bush energy policy is silent on restricting CO2 emissions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush energy plan puts a great deal of faith into unreliable and dangerous strategies. One such strategy is nuclear power. While nuclear plants don't emit traditional air pollutants, they do raise the level of other, much more catastrophic health threats. An accident at a nuclear plant could injure or kill thousands of people. The Bush plan encourages increased reliance on nuclear power and allows for the development of new technologies, including the use of weapons-grade plutonium for nuclear reactors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another questionable practice endorsed in the Bush plan is the use of so-called 'clean coal' technology. The reality is that this 'clean coal' still emits seven times the pollution of a natural gas plant working under similar conditions. Burning clean coal still releases dangerous toxins which endanger the health of all populations exposed. The Bush energy plan also calls for tax incentives to encourage biomass energy production which could lead to increases in municipal waste incineration, thereby significantly adding harmful dioxin into our communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush energy plan does not demonstrate any concern about public health or our existing legislation to protect the American people. The Bush plan would review regulatory action against polluting utilities undermining the Clean Air Act. Our nation has better options: efficiency, alternative sources and conservation is the best medicine for our energy needs. A decreased reliance on fossil fuels and a timely transition to sustainable energy sources, in concert with more comprehensive efficiency plans, will lead to improved overall public health. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan protects only the health of the oil, coal, and electricity industries, while leaving our nation dangerously exposed to health hazards. The health of America depends on a progressive and sustainable approach.</font></p>
