<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Desire For Protection Is Understandable, <br>

But Buying More Guns 

Won't Make Us Safer </b></font>

</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Statement by Michael Beard, <br>

President of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The outpouring of patriotism and national pride in the wake of 

the terrorist attacks of September 11 has been truly remarkable. As 

the country recovers and prepares for a response, there is the 

overwhelming sense that we are doing so together, as a unified 

nation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;However, one response to the attacks is troubling. There are 

ongoing reports from around the country of an increase in gun 

sales. The reason is clear: Americans are apprehensive, and are 

actively seeking ways to gain a greater sense of protection and 

security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While these motives are understandable, we must remember what 

research has clearly shown: a gun in the home is far more likely to 

be involved in an unintended tragedy than in self protection. For 

evidence of this, one need look no further than Virginia, where a 

three-year old boy accidentally shot himself with the very handgun 

his father brought into the home to protect his family in the wake 

of the attacks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What is more, as law abiding citizens arm themselves, criminals 

and others with sinister motives are able to do exactly the same 

because of our nation's lax gun laws. Criminals of all stripes can 

easily buy a gun from a gun show, over the Internet, or through the 

classified ads with no background check, no questions asked. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In light of these circumstances, the Coalition urges citizens 

to think twice before bringing guns into their homes, and urges 

Congress to again take up legislation to prohibit the unregulated 

sale of guns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the end, real protection for Americans will mean not arming 

every family but ensuring that people who should not have guns 

cannot get them -- that means strong gun laws.&quot; </font></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
