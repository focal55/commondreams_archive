- February 26 - This bill will not solve the energy crisis, but will make

already profitable companies even wealthier. The legislation

subsidizes them for the typical costs of doing business. The oil,

gas, coal and nuclear industries don't need a helping hand from

taxpayers.

<p>Contrary to news reports, the current bill is very similar to

initial drafts have been circulating around Washington. While some

provisions may have slightly changed, the overall bill remains the

same. It is still a massive giveaway to energy companies that

throw millions of dollars in campaign cash at Washington

politicians.

<p>Senator Murkowski has publicly stated that there is no corporate

welfare in this bill. However, the Murkowski bill dishes out at

least $21 billion in subsidies and tax breaks to energy companies

seeing record profits.

<p>Throwing bags of money at these companies won't solve the

current energy crisis. Most of the subsidies in this bill have

proven to be expensive failures of past administrations and will do

nothing to benefit taxpayers or ratepayers.

<p>In the last 50 years, Washington has given big energy companies

over $111 billion for research and development programs that have

done nothing to prevent our current energy woes. We have learned

that throwing billions of dollars at the problems didn't make a

lick of difference. It is illogical to throw money at programs that

don't work and fail to provide a fair return to taxpayers on their

investment.

<p>Highlights of the bill:

<p>-- Requiring the federal government to pay half the cost for

installing new coal technology in power plants.

<p>-- Paying nuclear power plants $500 million over 10 years to

produce more electricity.

<p>-- Expanding a program to recover oil from low-producing wells

that will cost taxpayers $300 million over five years.

<p>-- Reducing oil royalty payments for deep-water oil and gas

developments.

<p>-- Providing a tax credit for non-conventional sources of

energy.

<p>A complete analysis of the bill will be available online at

<a href="http://www.taxpayer.net">http://www.taxpayer.net</a> or by

calling 202-546-8500, ext. 110 by 2

p.m. this afternoon.
