- February 1 - The following is a

statement by Feminist Majority President Eleanor Smeal:

<p>"This historic vote on John Ashcroft for U.S. Attorney

General sends a message to President Bush: "You don't have a

mandate to use the courts or the Department of Justice to

reverse civil rights and/or women's rights." What's more, 42

votes indicate this unprecedented coalition of women's and civil

rights, labor, gun control, environmental groups can and will

block a hostile Supreme Court appointment.

<p>"In my 25 years as a women's rights leader I have never seen

such a strong, diverse citizens' coalition to block a cabinet

position. This coalition will continue to grow to ensure

hostile appointments to the Supreme Court will not prevail.

<p>"I am very proud that 100 percent of the Democratic women

Senators voted to stop Ashcroft and voted to protect the hard

won gains of the women's rights movement. Our constituents,

members and supporters have spoken loudly and clearly, and they

will be watching. Like the Clarence Thomas vote, the lack of

women and minorities in the U.S. Senate is more apparent than

ever. And like the Clarence Thomas vote, too many men in the

Senate still don't get it. And like the Clarence Thomas vote,

because of their vote today some Senators will not be returning.

And, if the moderate Republicans continue to ignore their

constituency, their numbers will continue to dwindle.

<p>"This fight forced Ashcroft in sworn testimony to go on

record that he will enforce Roe v. Wade, Freedom of Access to

Clinic Entrances Act (FACE), and civil rights and women's rights

laws and we intend to hold him, the Senate, and the President

accountable."
