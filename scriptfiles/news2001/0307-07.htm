- March 7 - On Feb. 21 the London Times reported that the US has been

covertly helping to stabilize Saddam Hussein's control of Iraq

while Iraqi children suffer under the sanctions.

</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They reported:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(One UN) official said that he could not think of a single

success of the policy "except in killing children."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pointing to the toleration of smuggling (oil) across Iraq's

borders into Turkey and Jordan, (the official) said that many

believed the real objective was to maintain a weak but stable

President Saddam Hussein in power (and to benefit the US)....

"Turkey is allowed to take in all the oil it can because it

provides the Incirlik base from which British and American planes

patrol the northern no-fly zone over Iraq."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You have to ask...what it is about the status quo that the

Americans like."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hans von Sponeck, one of the former "oil for food" coordinators

who quit his UN position in protest of sanctions, responded, "Many

have the perception that 'containment' rather than 'elimination' to

date has been the preferred option. In the meantime, Iraqi

civilians continue to pay the price."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Hampshire Peace Action (NHPA) is asking that Congress

investigate these claims.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patrick Carkin, NHPA co-director and former US Army intelligence

analyst, responded, "We've been stating this to Congress for over

a year now. The policy helps keep Hussein in power while also

keeping him contained. We're talking out of both sides of our

mouth. Meanwhile, innocent children continue to die due to our

actions. It's hard to believe that the US can justify preventing

diphtheria vaccines for the children from entering Iraq under the

guise of "dual usage," but can't stop a huge oil tanker that helps

Hussein. If it's true that US forces are using this oil in Turkey

then we're talking about a conspiracy on par with Iran/Contra-gate.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's heartening to know that Powell is finally examining the

sanctions in more detail. But that's just the beginning. It's

morally and legally imperative that Congress investigate these

claims and that Iraqi citizens no longer suffer under this policy."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These House offices have been asked to investigate:

Allen (D-ME), Baldacci (D-ME), Frank (D-MA), Bass (R-NH)

Hall (D-OH), Paul (R-TX), Smith (R-NJ), Sununu (R-NH),

Tauscher (D-CA)
