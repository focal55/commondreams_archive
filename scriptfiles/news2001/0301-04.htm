- March 1 - Common Cause will convene a diverse and distinguished group of

election experts and civic leaders to advance the current debate on

the future of voting reform on Friday, March 2, at 9:30 a.m. at the

Jurys Washington Hotel in Dupont Circle, 1500 New Hampshire Avenue,

N.W. Spanning a wide range of cutting-edge election reform issues,

the discussion will include Internet voting, maximizing citizen

access to voting, the pros and cons of the Electoral College, and the

likelihood of reform being passed in the current Congress.

<p>Participants in the forum, which will be moderated by Common Cause

President Scott Harshbarger, include:

<p>-- Thomas Mann, the Senior Fellow in American Governance and

former director of Government Studies at the Brookings Institute, is

one of the preeminent scholars on election reform and money in

politics. He is currently working on a book about the future of

Internet voting.

<p>-- Melanie Campbell, a community leader with 15 years experience,

is Executive Director of the National Coalition on Black Civic

Participation, a membership organization dedicated to increasing

African-American participation in the democratic process. Campbell

was recognized as one of Washington D.C.'s Top Forty Under Forty

Emerging Leaders.

<p>-- Robert Pastor is the Goodrich White Professor of International

Relations at Emory University and President of Common Cause Georgia.

An expert on developing democracies, he has organized international

delegations to monitor and mediate elections in 20 countries

including Nicaragua, Mexico, the West Bank, Liberia, and China.

<p>-- Roy Saltman, a computer scientist and leading consultant on

election policy and technology, has written numerous publications on

the accuracy and effectiveness of computerized voting, both in the

United States as well as in developing countries.

<p>-- Martin Siegel is Special Counsel to Senator Charles Schumer

(D-N.Y.) and was formerly Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern

District of New York. Senator Schumer has co-sponsored the Voting

Study and Improvement Act, a leading bill this year on electoral
