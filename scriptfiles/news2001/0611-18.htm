- June 11 - &quot;Today's statement by President Bush on global warming is yet another attempt to gloss-over the lack of any meaningful measures in the administration's nascent climate policy. After five months in office, the president has finally admitted that global warming is a serious problem - a reality that led his father to sign the original Rio global warming framework treaty nearly a decade ago. But the president stubbornly fails to acknowledge that voluntary efforts alone won't achieve the reductions in emissions of heat-trapping gases needed to address this threat. In essence, the president is saying, 'read my lips - no real commitment.' </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Under the Rio treaty, the US is obligated to try to return our emissions to 1990 levels. Despite a host of voluntary initiatives undertaken in the 1990s, US emissions are now 12 percent above that target, and are projected to increase further over the next decade. This clear trend is what led governments - including the US - to determine that mandatory emissions limits such as those established in the Kyoto Protocol are necessary. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now the president proposes years of additional research and technology development as the answer to global warming. Research is important, and it will be helpful if the president reverses his proposed draconian cuts of up to 50 percent in key federal energy efficiency and renewable energy budgets. But research isn't enough; we need strong government policies to move clean energy and transportation technologies that exist today more rapidly into the marketplace. The president's statement fails to make any specific policy commitments that would actually make heat-trapping emissions cuts a reality. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The world is paying a steep price for the Bush administration's slow learning curve on global warming. President Bush has finally admitted global warming is a problem; when he returns from his European trip, he must put some real policies on the table. Only then can the US hope to end its reign as the world's global warming scofflaw and start being part of the solution.&quot;</font></p>
