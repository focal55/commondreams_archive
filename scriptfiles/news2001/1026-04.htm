- October 26 - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) deplores the fact that bombs have once again been dropped on its warehouses in Kabul. A large (3X3 m) red cross on a white background was clearly displayed on the roof of each building in the complex. Initial reports indicate that nobody was hurt in this latest incident.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At about 11.30 a.m. local time, ICRC staff saw a large, slow-flying aircraft drop two bombs on the compound from low altitude. This is the same compound in which a building was destroyed in similar circumstances on 16 October. In this latest incident, three of the remaining four buildings caught fire. Two are said to have suffered direct hits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the incident on 16 October, the ICRC informed the United States authorities once again of the location of its facilities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The buildings contained the bulk of the food and blankets that the ICRC was in the process of distributing to some 55,000 disabled and other particularly vulnerable persons. The US authorities had also been notified of the distribution and the movement of vehicles and gathering of people at distribution points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICRC also deplores the occupation and looting of its offices in Mazar-i-Sharif which were taken over by armed men three days ago. Office equipment, including computers, and vehicles were stolen. ICRC representations both to local authorities and to the Taliban ambassador in Pakistan have had no effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ICRC reiterates that attacking or occupying facilities marked with the red cross emblem constitutes a violation of international humanitarian law.</font></p>
