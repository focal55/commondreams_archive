- May 1 - A bipartisan panel of national security specialists today

issued a report urging President Bush to delay deployment of a national

missile defense system and endorsed the administration's plan to make

significant reductions in the U.S. stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons.

The report, Policymakers Views on Addressing the Nuclear Threat, was based

on interviews conducted in recent months with more than 40 key policymakers

and defense experts.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The panel, known as the Annapolis Group, after the site of its original

meeting back in 1989, interviewed both Republican and Democratic

policymakers to determine consensus on the key nuclear weapons issues

facing President Bush. Its recommendations, based on those interviews, are

contained in a memorandum presented to President Bush and other

administration officials today. Transcripts of the interviews were also

provided to the administration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We sampled views across the spectrum, from the most conservative

Republican to classic liberal Democrat. What we are offering to the

President and his national security team is solid, mainstream thinking on

nuclear weapons issues,&quot; said John Rhinelander, arms control expert and

member of the Annapolis Group.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among those interviewed were former Senator Sam Nunn; former Joint Chiefs

chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili; Senators James Inhofe, Joseph Biden, Carl

Levin, Max Cleland; Reps. Lindsey Graham, Porter Goss, John Spratt; and

former Bush and Clinton administration officials Arnold Kanter, James

Steinberg, Douglas Paal, Peter Rodman, and William Perry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group's central recommendations are as follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The President needs to pay closer attention to Russia if the U.S. is to

make progress on a number of important issues affecting national security,

including reductions in strategic nuclear weapons and materials, missile

defense, and proliferation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The administration should seek significant reductions in U.S. strategic

nuclear weapons in consultation with Russia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Research and development should go forward on missile defense, but the

President should delay a decision on deployment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Additional funding and attention is needed to prevent the spread of

weapons of mass destruction, including threat reduction and stockpile

programs with Russia, unfinished missile negotiations with North Korea, and

the recommendations of the Baker-Cutler report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The administration should continue its comprehensive review of nuclear

weapons policy, and consider building on the Rumsfeld review by seeking

additional outside views to build bipartisan support for national security

policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A careful reading of history in the nuclear age will reveal that despite

the inclination of new administrations to change policy abruptly from that

of its predecessor, success in this vital area of national security almost

always requires a return to a policy based on consensus,&quot; the report stated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Annapolis Group includes: Alton Frye, Joseph Cirincione, John Isaacs,

Amb. Thomas Graham, Jr., Edith B. Wilkie and John Rhinelander. The Group is

chaired by Beth DeGrasse, who coordinated the 1989 memorandum that was

presented to then incoming President George Bush. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On missile defense, the group noted that missile defense was &quot;one of the

most divisive issues in the entire national security debate.&quot;  The report

stated, &quot;While support for missile defense in the future is evident, there

is little enthusiasm for immediate deployment of any system and or

near-term withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</font></p>
