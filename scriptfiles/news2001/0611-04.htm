- June 11 - The Sierra Club today released a report showing that the

federal School Lunch Program has continuously awarded hundreds of millions

of dollars in federal contracts to 12 companies that have had massive food

safety recalls or violated environmental and worker safety laws.  During

the past five years, the federal government paid these companies $485

million for meat for public schools and other federal food programs.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The animal factories producing meat for the federal School Lunch Program

have polluted our air and water, experienced industrial accidents that

resulted in worker deaths, and put children's health at risk,&quot; said Hank

Graddy, Chair of the Sierra Club's Clean Water Committee.  &quot;Meanwhile the

federal government continues to reward this bad behavior by giving

irresponsible federal contractors millions of taxpayers' dollars every

year.  &quot;It's time to turn off the spigot of taxpayer money flowing to

companies that violate our environmental and worker safety laws and

threaten public health.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report reviews the records of 18 slaughterhouses and meat processing

plants, owned by 12 companies, that sold meat to U.S. Department of

Agriculture's School Lunch Program.  Based primarily on state and federal

regulatory agencies' records, court documents and corporate reference

materials, the study provides many examples of contaminated food, worker

endangerment and pollution at these slaughterhouses and processing plants.

For example:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;    Tyson Food, which provided the largest quantity of food to the School

Lunch Program, racked up $102.7 million in sales from the School Lunch and

other programs for sales of poultry, despite a history of environmental

violations at its Monett, Missouri plant.  At another Tyson's plant in

Kentucky, two workers were killed in an industrial accident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;    In 1996, John Morrell &amp; Company paid $3 million in fines and penalties

for criminal violations of the Clean Water Act at its Sioux Falls, South

Dakota plant, yet continued to receive payments for sales of pork for

federal nutrition programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;    Between 1993 and 1997, the State of North Carolina documented at least

120 violations of pollution limits at Smithfield Packing Company's Tar Heel

plant.  Smithfield, which now owns John Morrell, is the world's largest

integrated pork producer and packer.  In December 2000, a judge with the

National Labor Relations Board found that Smithfield had committed

&quot;egregious and pervasive&quot; violations of federal labor law at its Tar Heel

plant.  Yet Smithfield has received $9.5 million from the sale of pork for

the federal food programs since 1997.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;    Over a recent eight-month period, five of the 12 companies have had to

recall large quantities of contaminated food.  Gold Kist and Supreme Beef

Processors had sold meat to the School Lunch program during this time.

Gold Kist, H&amp;H Meat, IBP and Tyson have sold food to the School Lunch

Program since having had recalls.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The strongest incentive these animal factories have to safeguard our air

and water, produce safe food for schoolchildren and protect their workers

is the potential loss of contracts worth millions of dollars,&quot; said Graddy.

&quot;The federal government should contract with companies capable of abiding

by our laws.&quot;</font></p>
