- September 6 - A prominent budget 

watchdog group today called for an investigation to determine 

whether taxpayer funds were used to pay for an exclusive fireworks 

display that took place at the White House last night. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Taxpayers have the right to know whether they paid for this 

elaborate and unnecessary spectacle,&quot; commented Jill Lancelot, 

Legislative Director at Taxpayers for Common Sense. &quot;We need to 

make sure that we're getting the biggest bang for our buck with our 

tax dollars and picking up the tab for a fireworks display at an 

essentially private event isn't the way to do that.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One hundred thirty-six White House guests were treated to a 

fireworks display on the Ellipse that reportedly cost $175,000 to 

$250,000. The public was neither invited to attend nor told of the 

display. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The White House should spill the beans on who paid for this 

display,&quot; said Lancelot. &quot;If public funds were used, the White 

House should repay the Treasury from private contributions.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group said growing concerns over diminished federal budget 

surplus projections warrant an investigation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The federal government may have to take $9 billion from the 

Social Security surplus just to make ends meet,&quot; said Lancelot. 

&quot;Spending money on glitzy White House celebrations sends a terrible 

message in this tense budget climate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group also questioned the Bush Administration's motives in 

awarding the contract for the display to Zambelli Fireworks 

Internationale. George Zambelli, the head of the company, gave a 

$2,000 individual contribution to George W. Bush's presidential 

campaign last year, according to federal campaign finance data. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While it may not seem like much, this is a pretty good return 

on Mr. Zambelli's investment if taxpayers footed the bill,&quot; 

concluded Lancelot.
