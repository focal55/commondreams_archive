<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 28 -  Greenpeace and several Alaskan  environmental and nuclear disarmament groups filed a  lawsuit today to halt construction of a controversial facility in  Fort Greely, Alaska that would be used to launch missiles to  test President Bush's proposed missile defense plan. The  lawsuit filed by Natural Resources Defense Council, alleges  that the Department of Defense failed to complete a  federally mandated environmental impact statement for  construction of the Star Wars facility at Fort Greely, as well  as other sites in Alaska, Hawaii, the continental U.S. and the  Marshall Islands. Ground clearing at Fort Greely is  scheduled to begin shortly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"President Bush's attempts to engage Star Wars here in  Alaska are not just immoral but his plans may be illegal,"  said Melanie Duchin, Greenpeace Nuclear/Climate  Campaigner in Alaska. "Alaskans or any body else who cares about the planet will not sit by while this administration threatens Alaska's environment with this program."

</font>

</p>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives from the Anchorage-based plaintiffs,  including Alaska Community Action on Toxics, Alaska  Action Center, Alaska Public Interest Research Group and  Greenpeace will hold a press conference at 11:00 a.m.  (Anchorage Time) to discuss the lawsuit and the dangers of  the proposed facility in Fort Greeley.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Fort Greely lawsuit comes just one day before  Greenpeace activists will appear in a Los Angeles federal  court for a hearing arising from a peaceful protest at  Vandenberg Air Force Base during the missile test on July  14, 2001. During the scheduled hearing, attorneys for some  of the defendants will file a motion to lift travel restrictions.  The international activists involved in the peaceful protest  have been restricted from travel outside of the southern  California area until the trial currently set for September 25,  2001. </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In Greenpeace's 30 year history we have never had a  defendant not show up in court so to say that these  individuals are flight risks is outrageous," said Matt  Stembridge, Greenpeace Nuclear Disarmament  Campaigner. "These defendants are looking forward to their  day in court when the dangers of Bush's Star Wars  program will become apparent."</font></P>
