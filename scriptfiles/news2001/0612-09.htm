- June 12 - Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and Consumers Union (CU) today submitted a study to Congress that analyzes the need to impose a tax on energy producers who manipulate the market in order to drive up prices and reap excessive profits.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The so-called windfall profits tax would take &quot;the fun and profit out of market manipulation and help the market to operate more efficiently,&quot; said Mark Cooper, Research Director of CFA.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The consumer groups said lawmakers should consider the tax in the wake of the breakdown of the wholesale electricity market and natural gas markets throughout California and the Western United States. The groups had hoped to testify on the subject Wednesday afternoon at a two-day hearing held by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures. However, the committee decided not to invite any consumer groups to speak at the hearing. Rep. James McDermott, D-Wash., a member of the committee, planned to submit the consumer study as part of his opening statement this afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study makes five major points in establishing why the Western electricity crisis is a federal problem that merits the imposition of a windfall profits tax:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Fundamental demand and supply conditions in the California electricity market make it vulnerable to the abuse of market power by energy producers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The remarkable run-up in prices is due in large part to the premature and unjustified deregulation of the wholesale electricity and natural gas markets in California by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and FERC's subsequent failure to discipline pricing abuse in those and other markets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Prices have been driven up by the strategic behavior of merchant generators who have subsequently profited from those increases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. The profits are excessive by any reasonable measure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Taxing away windfalls such as this will not detract from the incentive to build generating capacity to meet demand at a reasonable profit. To the contrary, removing the fun and profit from market manipulation will cause the supply-side of the market to function more efficiently.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the FERC cannot be counted on to enforce laws that require just and reasonable rates, then other federal actions must be taken to provide a back stop to an agency that has been derelict in its duty. A windfall profits tax would be one such policy,&quot; Cooper concluded.</font></p>
