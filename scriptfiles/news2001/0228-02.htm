- February 28 - The Sierra Club today noted that while President George W.

Bush's address to Congress did mention environmental issues,  it included

proposals that could have serious impacts on environmental protection.

<p>

"President Bush's address to Congress last night shed little additional

light on  his administration's environmental policies," said Sierra Club

Executive Director Carl Pope.  "While on the face of it, President Bush

declares a desire to protect the environment, it is the details of his

plans that will truly show whether this administration will preserve our

natural treasures or exploit resources for the short term benefit of

industry."

<p>

"When it comes to President Bush's environmental policy, the devil will be

in the details," continued Pope.

<p>

Bush continued to push an energy policy which he has said will include

drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Bush's continued

emphasis on increased production over conservation is fundamentally flawed

because there is too little supply of oil in the U.S. to affect the energy

situation and the environmental cost is far too high. Bush's plan would do

nothing to solve America's energy problems but would increase global

warming pollution and destroy one of the last unique and unspoiled natural

places left on the earth.  True energy solutions set  America on the path

to a sustainable, clean, and affordable energy future. We must increase

efficiency, develop renewable energy, and replace older power plants with

more efficient, less polluting power plants.

<p>

While Bush's tax cut plan does not explicitly mention the environment, the

overly large and fundamentally unfair cut could have serious implications

for environmental protection in this country.  Financing the President's

tax plan could trade vital funds for preserving clean air, clean water, and

special places in exchange for a tax benefit for the wealthiest Americans.

<p>

While the Sierra Club was pleased that President Bush fulfilled his

campaign promise to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund and

pledged $4.9 billion for the maintenance of National Parks, the real test

of his commitment to environmental protection will be whether he funds the

full range of environmental  programs that protect our clean water, clean

air, and unique, natural places.

<p>

"If Bush truly wanted to protect the environment and save money, he could

cut below cost timber sales, subsidies to the oil industry, and pork barrel

Army Corps of Engineers projects," said Pope.  "These are the kind of

details on which we will judge the Bush budget."
