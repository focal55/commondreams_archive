- January 6 - The following statement

was issued by Bob Fertik and David Lytel, Co-founder of

Democrats.com:

<p>"On behalf of the members of Democrats.com, we wish to express

our profound gratitude and admiration for the Congressional Black

Caucus and the individual Members of Congress who stood today

before Congress, the American people, and the world to object to

the certification of Florida's 25 stolen Electors.

<p>Today, George W. Bush completed the penultimate step in his

theft of the American Presidency. Bush's theft will be completed on

January 20 when he takes the oath of office, to uphold the

Constitution of the United States of America - which he has already

broken by orchestrating a concerted effort to prevent the counting

of every vote cast in Florida. Even worse, this oath will be

administered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was Bush's

principal accomplice in the theft of the Presidency when he joined

with four fellow Republican Justices in blocking the manual recount

specified under Florida law.

<p>We are extremely proud of the fourteen Members of Congress who

rose in protest today: Corrine Brown, Eva Clayton, Elijah Cummings,

Peter Deutsch, Bob Filner, Jesse Jackson Jr., Eddie Bernice

Johnson, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, Carrie Meek, Cynthia

McKinney, Patsy Mink, Maxine Waters, and above all Alcee Hastings.

As a result of their efforts, history will show

that members of the Democratic Party were not willing to accept the

ultimate crime against democracy - the theft of the Presidency.

<p>We look forward to working with the Congressional Black Caucus

and other Democrats of conscience in opposing the appointments and

programs of the illegitimate Bush administration. We look forward

to joining with progressive allies in voicing our outrage at the

Inauguration on January 20 and beyond. And we look forward to

future elections, when we will do everything in our power to make

sure that every voter casts a vote, every vote is properly counted,

and the Republicans who stole this election are permanently removed

from office.

<p>To show our appreciation to the "Florida Fourteen," we are

sending cards and flowers to their offices and we invite our fellow

Democrats to join in this effort by visiting our Web site at
