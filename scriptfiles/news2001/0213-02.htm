- February 13 - Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) announced

today that more than 100 chapters are participating in &quot;From Our House to the School

House: A Recipe for Safe Schools,&quot; a nationwide program to make schools safe for gay,

lesbian, bisexual and transgendered (GLBT) students and others. Through the program, PFLAG

chapters work with their local school district to incorporate GLBT-positive images in

their resources, programs and curricula.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>&quot;We are very proud of the work that PFLAG members around the country are

doing in their local school districts,&quot;said Kirsten Kingdon, PFLAG Executive

Director. &quot;Our national safe schools program gives local PFLAG chapters the tools

to work within their school system to dismantle institutional homophobia and promote a

more inclusive environment.&quot;</small></font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>&quot;From Our House to the School House&quot; is a long-term program to make

school a safe and welcoming environment for all students, particularly GLBT students,

those whose parents are GLBT, and those who are perceived to be GLBT. It was formally

launched in October 2000. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>&quot;There is so much change that needs to occur before GLBT students can feel

safe in their schools,&quot; said Kingdon. &quot;The first step is educating school

administration, faculty and support staff about dangerous attitudes and biased practices.

Then we can move on to implement training programs, non-discrimination policies, and

resources that support GLBT youth. We&#146;re looking forward to more chapters to become

involved.&quot;</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Here are just some examples of the work that PFLAG is doing around the country.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In California, 14 PFLAG chapters are working with their local school districts

to train administrators, faculty and counselors on student safety issues. Many chapters

are helping to create or supporting student Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA&#146;s). </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In Virginia, PFLAG Fredericksburg trained 200 teachers in the Stafford School

District. Students report &quot;Safe Zone&quot; stickers are showing up in schools as a

result of the training, and the program will now serve as a model for two adjoining

counties.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In New York, the Long Island chapter met with Lieutenant Governor Mary Donohue

in October to discuss the implementation of the Project SAVE (Safe Schools Against

Violence in Education), to promote a safer and more effective learning environment within

New York State's schools. Two members of the Buffalo/Niagra Area chapter are doing

presentations to local high school educators. They are also meeting with the school board

to pass a non-discrimination policy, and are currently preparing a presentation for school

nurses on GLBT issues. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In Colorado, the Boulder chapter is a leading organization in the Boulder Valley

Safe Schools Coalition. In November, the Coalition held a breakfast for more than 80

school administrators, parents, Board of Education members, and community leaders to learn

about safe and inclusive schools. They invited school board candidates to participate in

their program, &quot;Can We Legislate Safe Schools for GLBT Students,&quot; and to talk

about how the Colorado Board of Education can implement new programs. </small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>In Arizona, safe schools work has been going on for several years. Last year,

the Phoenix chapter gave 59 educational presentations to a total of 854 adults and 786

students. In conjunction with &quot;From Our House to the School House,&quot; Phoenix

PFLAG members are hoping to double their numbers this year and expand programs around the

state.</small></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>Students who are GLBT or who are perceived to be such face unique and

overwhelming challenges in daily school life:</small> 



</font>

<ul>

  

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>GLBT youth are 2-3 times more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual youth,

    and 30% of completed youth suicides annually are committed by GLBT youth. </small></font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>80% of GLB youth report severe problems due to cognitive, social and emotional

    isolation. </small></font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><small>97% of public school students report regularly hearing homophobic remarks from

    peers </small></font></li>

</ul>
