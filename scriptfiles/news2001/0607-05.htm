- June  7 - Addressing key 

questions about global warming, the National Academy of Sciences 

(NAS) confirmed the concerns of the environment and public 

health community in a new report. The NAS declared global 

warming a real problem impacting key vulnerable populations. The 

report also confirmed that global warming is caused, at least in 

part, by the actions of humankind. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This should be the final science needed to take action on 

global climate change,&quot; said Physicians for Social 

Responsibility (PSR) Environment and Health Director Susan T. 

West, M.P.H. &quot;Human activity is changing our climate, 

threatening the health of our children and other vulnerable 

populations. We must take action now.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Academy of Sciences report was produced to 

address questions the Bush Administration had about the UN 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings that 

climate change will have negative impacts on human health across 

the globe. The NAS report confirms those findings, and urges 

action today as well. The report states that &quot;national policy 

decisions made now and in the long term future will influence 

the extent of any damage suffered by vulnerable human 

populations and ecosystems later in this century.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that this report, affirming the findings of the 

IPCC's third assessment and clearly linking national policy to 

our future health, must move our country to action.&quot; said West. 

&quot;The NAS reports specifically indicts carbon dioxide as an 

important greenhouse gas, though the Bush Administration energy 

plan ignores it completely. We must put America's health above 

the interests of the coal and oil industries.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases cited in the 

report, including methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons 

contribute to a climate shift leading to disastrous 

consequences: Heat-related illness and injury, severe weather 

and sea-level rise, and global increases in vector-borne 

diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and West Nile Virus. 

Carbon dioxide emissions are directly related to poor air 

quality. Poor air quality leads to increases in cardiovascular 

disease and respiratory illnesses such as asthma.
