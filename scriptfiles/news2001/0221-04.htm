- February 21 - TV

                    preacher Pat Robertson, one of President George W. Bush's

                    most reliable political allies, blasted the president's

                    &quot;faith-based&quot; initiative yesterday, describing the

                    administration's plan to provide public funding of minority

                    religions as &quot;appalling.&quot;</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

                    public criticism, aired nationally on Robertson's &quot;700

                    Club&quot; television program, was startling to many

                    considering Robertson's unwavering partisan support for the

                    Bush administration. It also indicated the fragile coalition

                    of groups supporting Bush's faith-based plan may already be

                    showing signs of fraying.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This

                    means Bush's plan is in enormous political trouble,&quot;

                    said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans

                    United for Separation of Church and State. &quot;When

                    staunch Bush allies like Robertson start jumping ship, the

                    plan clearly appears to be sinking.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robertson,

                    whose comments coincided with the first day of operations

                    for the president's Office of Faith-Based and Community

                    Initiatives, said the Bush plan could be detrimental for

                    churches and the government.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I

                    really don't know what to do,&quot; said Robertson,

                    president of the Christian Coalition. &quot;But this thing

                    could be a real Pandora's box. And what seems to be such a

                    great initiative can rise up to bite the organizations as

                    well as the federal government. And I'm a little concerned

                    about it, frankly.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robertson

                    was particularly concerned that non-Christian religious

                    minorities he doesn't like will receive public tax dollars

                    under the Bush plan, including Hare Krishnas, the Church of

                    Scientology and followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;You

                    know I hate to find myself on the side of the

                    Anti-Defamation League and others, but this is, this gets to

                    be a real problem,&quot; Robertson said. &quot;I mean, the

                    Moonies have been prescribed, if I can use that, for

                    brainwashing techniques, sleep deprivation and all the rest

                    of it that goes along with their unusual proselytizing. The

                    Hare Krishnas much the same thing.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And

                    it seems appalling to me that we’re going to go for

                    somebody like that, or the Church of Scientology, which was

                    involved in an incredible campaign against the IRS,&quot;

                    Robertson added. &quot;I mean, they were accused of all

                    sorts of underhanded tactics. And in Germany, because of

                    Scientology, there’s been a crackdown, essentially, on

                    many evangelical groups that were triggered by the revulsion

                    against some of their beliefs and practices.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robertson

                    was not the only religious leader expressing reservations

                    about the Bush initiative yesterday. Joanne Negstad,

                    president of Lutheran Services in America, told the

                    Associated Press she has concerns that the program could

                    lead to forced proselytizing. She added that the federally

                    funded employment discrimination that would occur under

                    Bush's plan &quot;really bothers us.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sharon

                    Daly, vice president for social policy at Catholic Charities

                    USA, raised a similar point, saying, &quot;Do [the American

                    people] think it's appropriate for government funds to be

                    used in programs that would discriminate in their hiring?

                    It's a very big question that needs to be discussed.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans

                    United, the leading opponent of Bush's faith-based plan,

                    believes with questions such as these burdening the

                    initiative, Robertson won't be the last ally of the

                    president to abandon support for the program.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As

                    more and more people look at the details of the Bush plan, I

                    think you'll see a lot more criticism similar to

                    Robertson's,&quot; said AU's Lynn. &quot;Whether you're on

                    the left, right or center, Bush's plan is disastrous public

                    policy.&quot;
