emerging coalition of opposition forces in Afghanistan have a record of 

serious human rights abuse, Human Rights Watch said in a                 

backgrounder released today.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The U.S. and its allies should not cooperate with commanders whose 

record of brutality raises questions about their legitimacy inside 

Afghanistan,&quot; said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division 

of Human Rights Watch. &quot;Any country that gives assistance to the Afghan 

opposition must take responsibility for how this assistance is used.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch urged in particular that no cooperation be            

                                   extended to Abdul Rashid Dostum, the 

head of the Junbish militia; Haji Muhammad Muhaqqiq, a senior commander 

of Hizb-i Wahdat; Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the erstwhile Ittihad-i 

Islami; and Abdul Malik Pahlawan, a former senior Junbish commander. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abuses that were reported from an area controlled by a United Front 

faction in late 1999 and early 2000 include summary executions, burning 

of houses, and looting, principally targeting ethnic Pashtuns and others 

suspected of supporting the Taliban. Children, including those under the 

age of fifteen, have been recruited by both the United Front and 

Taliban. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The various parties that comprise the United Front also amassed a 

deplorable record of attacks on civilians between the fall of the 

Najibullah regime in 1992 and the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Not a single Afghan commander has been held accountable for human 

rights abuses,&quot; said Jones. &quot;The time to break this cycle of impunity is 

now, and the United States and its allies will have the leverage to do 

it.&quot; </font></p>
