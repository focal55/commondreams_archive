- August 24 - Green Party organizers and

activists call the policies of the Bush Administration

irresponsible and reckless, and warn of severe damage

to the world environment, to the U.S. economy, and to

the role of the U.S. in international relations.  But

Greens say that the lack of a strong, unified response

from Democrats in Congress on many of these policies

-- and Democratic collusion in their introduction and

passage -- shows the urgent need for a progressive

third party.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When Clinton adopted the Republican Party's rhetoric

about 'big government,' it gave Republicans an excuse

to call for even more deregulation and privatization,"

said Jo Chamberlain, member of the steering committee

of the Green Party of the United States and a

California Green.  "These extremes come out of the

Bush White House on a daily basis, schemes like the

privatization of Social Security and the halt on

federal prosecutions for violations of the Clean Air

Act."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Both Democratic and Republican Parties have been

using the rhetorical threat of 'big government' as an

excuse to raid essential public services and

resources.  At the same time, they're beefing up the

power and wealth of corporations, through deregulation

and privatization, through tax breaks and bail-outs,

through military ventures and foreign policy designed

to benefit corporate interests.  We call that

corporate welfare -- big government for the benefit of

the wealthy."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The California blackouts have angered many Americans

over energy deregulation.  The stock market's

instability has made working Americans uneasy about

the dangerous plan to privatize Social Security.  They

realize that if the economy plummets, the least secure

place to stow one's retirement money is Wall Street.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Greens oppose 'big government' too," added Ben

Manski, another member of the Green Party Steering

Committee and a Green from Wisconsin.  "We oppose the

big government that invades our privacy, seeks to roll

back abortion rights, maintains the War on Drugs,

dumps our tax money into dangerous military ventures

and contracts, and gives corporations the means to

trample our rights and well-being."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The common policy of the Clinton and Bush

Administrations in support of secretive international

negotiations at the G8 Summit in July, supporting the

exploitative manipulation of the global economy by the

World Bank and IMF and unelected "free trade"

authorities (WTO, NAFTA, FTAA, etc.), draws special

criticism from Greens.  Party members have

participated in protests against all of these and have

condemned the police provocation and abuse against

peaceful demonstrators in Genoa, the site of the G8

meeting, and Quebec, at the FTAA meeting.  Thousands

of Greens will join the protests against the IMF and

World Bank in Washington, D.C. in late September.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Bush has been reckless as the leader of the only

global superpower," said Ben Manski.  "Bush refuses to

sign agreements establishing the international ban on

biological warfare which updates the 1972 Biological

Weapons Convention, a United Nations proposal to curb

the international sale of small arms, an international

court to investigate and prosecute genocide and war

crimes, and the Kyoto Treaty committing the U.S. to a

first step in slowing global warming.  With the same

irresponsibility, Bush is enacting national missile

defense, a pipedream of Ronald Reagan, revived by Bill

Clinton, which will gut the Anti-Ballistic Missile

Treaty."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public has now learned -- through the admissions

of high level defense officials -- that the July 14,

2001 test of an anti-missile weapon was rigged, with

an electronic beacon in its target that signaled the

target's location.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The White House also intends to withdraw the U.S. from

the U.N. Conference Against Racism planned for Durban,

South Africa on August 31, a move that's especially

unconscionable in light of a report from the U.N.

Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination

criticizing racially biased practices in the U.S.,

including the application of the death penalty,

incarceration rates, and police brutality.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"How much can Americans trust the Democrats to put up

a fight against Bush's destructive and regressive

White House policies?," asked Jo Chamberlain.  "36

Democratic members of the House joined with

Republicans to allow Bush to open Alaska's Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.  Democrats

in Congress blocked Bush's proposed $1.6 billion tax

break that benefits the rich and which will cut the

safety net for the poor -- by okaying a $1.35 billion

tax break, which is already erasing the budget surplus

and threatening to dip into Social Security funds. 

Sen. Hillary Clinton, the darling of liberals, voted

for a bankruptcy bill that enriches credit card

companies and hurts Americans in a financial crisis

because of job loss or medical bills.  Sen. Russ

Feingold, who's considering a White House run in 2004

as a progressive, helped Bush install John Ashcroft

and Gail Norton."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Green Party is now the party of the newly

emerging center, said Carol Miller, New Mexico Green

Party member.  "We're the party that supports neither

the military-industrial corporate welfare big

government that the two major parties now favor, nor a

return to the old social welfare big government of New

Deal Democrats.  Instead, we demand government that's

locally based and which advances environmentally

healthy sustainable economies, democratic workplaces,

human rights, and a strong social safety net."
