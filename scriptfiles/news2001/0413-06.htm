- April 13 - With Cincinnati in crisis amid protests against police shootings, 

the following analysts are available for interviews:



<P><LI>DE LACY DAVIS, <A HREF="mailto:bcap@compuserve.com">bcap@compuserve.com</A>, <A HREF="http://b-cap.tripod.com/b-cap_index.html">http://b-cap.tripod.com/b-cap_index.html</A>

<BR>The founder and president of Black Cops Against Police Brutality and a 

15-year veteran of the East Orange, N.J., police department, Davis is a 

sergeant in the community services unit. He said today: "Often the victims 

of police brutality are minority males, usually black or Latino or poor 

whites. I'm a police officer, but the police cannot police the police. 

Until there's a crisis, these issues are ignored, then we begin to see a 

system respond to their pain -- and then only in incremental steps. For two 

years we've been warning that it's a powder keg in Cincinnati. The city 

charter requires that the police chief comes from within the department, 

but that's not always best, it could simply recycle the same culture of 

racism and violence. Allegedly the police chief in Cincinnati referred to 

an officer as a 'nigger' at a management seminar last year. Civilian boards 

need more power, like subpoena power. Militaristic attitudes by the police 

need to be replaced with a community policing philosophy and an 

African-American centered paradigm in African-American communities."

<BR>Senior researcher on U.S. issues at Human Rights Watch and author of the 

report "Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the U.S."



<P><LI>MARY D. POWERS, <A HREF="http://web.syr.edu/~nkrhodes/N-COPA.html">http://web.syr.edu/~nkrhodes/N-COPA.html</A>

<BR>Powers is coordinator of the National Coalition on Police Accountability 

based in Chicago.



<P><LI>ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, <A HREF="mailto:xcolumn@aol.com">xcolumn@aol.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.uexpress.com/columnoftheamericas">http://www.uexpress.com/columnoftheamericas</A>

<BR>Author of "Justice: A Question of Race" and co-author of the syndicated 

"Column of the Americas," Rodriguez won a federal civil rights lawsuit 

against the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department for brutality against him. He 

said today: "Rioting is societal breakdown. It is what happens when people 

are brutalized and dehumanized...when they feel they have no recourse and 

no voice. In most cases, law enforcement abuses never make it to trial. We 

desperately need a national truth commission."



<P><LI>SAM WALKER, <A HREF="mailto:samwalker@unomaha.edu">samwalker@unomaha.edu</A>

<BR>Author of "Police Accountability: The Role of Citizen Oversight" and 

professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, 

Walker said today: "Given the number of fatal shootings of African 

Americans -- 15 since 1995 -- there's clearly a problem in Cincinnati. The 

ACLU is suing the police department. Other departments, like Minneapolis 

and San Jose, have established mechanisms of civilian oversight which have 

received support from the police departments and the mayors of those 

cities. You need early warning systems like citizen complaints and use of 

force reports to identify problem officers."
