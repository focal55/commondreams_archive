- September 5 -  The nation's leading gun 

violence prevention organizations submitted comments yesterday to 

the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), opposing Attorney General 

John Ashcroft's proposal to reduce the amount of time that National 

Instant Criminal System (NICS) background check records are kept 

from 90 days to one day. On July 6, Ashcroft proposed to destroy 

these critical records just one business day after a gun is sold, 

despite law enforcement officials saying they need to retain the 

records for at least 90 days to ensure the integrity of the 

background check system. The 60-day public comment period on the 

rule closed yesterday. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As the saying goes, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'&quot; said 

Michael Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign and the Brady 

Center to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;Since the Brady Law went into 

effect in 1994, background checks have stopped more than 680,000 

felons, fugitives and other prohibited purchasers from buying guns 

from licensed dealers. The NICS is a key component of the Brady 

Law and shortening the time that background check records are kept 

will seriously undermine law enforcement's efforts to keep guns out 

of the wrong hands.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its six pages of comments, the Brady Campaign and the Brady 

Center made several arguments against shortening the record-keeping 

period. They argued that the change will:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Undermine the core mission of the Brady Law and the NICS -- 

preventing prohibited purchasers from obtaining firearms;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cripple the FBI's ability to perform routine checks that 

ensure the accuracy and integrity of the NICS;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hamper the FBI's ability to identify instances in which the 

NICS is used for unauthorized purposes, such as gun dealers running 

background checks on people other than actual gun buyers, and 

protect against the invasions of privacy that would result from 

such misuse;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hinder the FBI's ability to determine whether potential 

handgun purchasers have stolen the identity of innocent and 

unsuspecting individuals or otherwise submitted false 

identification information in order to thwart the system. </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its comments, the Brady Campaign/Center also points out that 

the DOJ has already concluded that 90 days was the &quot;shortest 

practicable period of time for retaining records of allowed 

transfers that would permit the performance of basic security 

audits of the NICS,&quot; after a lengthy and comprehensive rule-making 

procedure that began in March 1999. The 90-day rule went into 

effect on July 3 of this year, yet just three days later, Attorney 

General Ashcroft proposed changing it once again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It defies common sense for the Attorney General to now suggest 

that a dramatic shortening of the record retention period -- from 

90 days to one -- suddenly becomes possible and desirable,&quot; said 

Barnes. &quot;Mr. Ashcroft's desire to change a rule that has already 

been thoroughly vetted can only be seen as more of his pandering to 

the gun lobby.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is not simply a procedural change -- there are lives at 

stake,&quot; he continued. &quot;The main beneficiaries of the proposed rule 

will be criminals and corrupt firearms dealers seeking to subvert 

federal gun laws. Furthermore, the proposed rule will jeopardize 

the privacy rights of all Americans -- by allowing corrupt dealers 

to conduct background checks of whomever they choose and by 

enabling criminals to engage in identity theft, both without fear 

of being detected.&quot; </font></p>
