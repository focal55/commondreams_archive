- April 9 -  President George W.

Bush's budget for the 2002 Fiscal Year does almost nothing to

prevent gun violence even as America approaches the second

anniversary of the April 20th Columbine High School massacre, the

Violence Policy Center (VPC) stated today. The VPC is a national

nonprofit educational organization working to stop gun death and

injury in America

<p>In a budget that is virtually bereft of measures to prevent gun

violence, President Bush is promoting the hiring of additional

armed guards for our nation's schools as the primary solution to

youth gun violence. According to the Associated Press, the Bush

budget would allocate enough funds to hire one guard in nearly two

percent of U.S. public schools in this country .

<p>Kristen Rand, legislative director for the Violence Policy

Center, states," The message from the Bush Administration is that

as a country we've accepted school shootings as inevitable and have

given up on trying to prevent them. President Bush is concentrating

his Administration's efforts on how to best structure the

shoot-outs, rather than trying to stop them from occurring in the

first place. The vast majority of parents would rather see their

children go to schools that are safe and gun-free-not modern-day

versions of the OK Corral."

<p>In addition, President Bush has proposed $75 million for child

safety lock giveaways. Adds Rand, "Unfortunately, without consumer

protection standards for the locks, there is no guarantee that this

program will fare any better than the recent gun-industry giveaway

that resulted in a recall of hundreds of thousands of distributed

locks."

<p>"We are shocked but not surprised that President Bush's budget

would promote a dangerous gun culture. After all, he is a strong

believer in the need for citizens to arm themselves. As Governor,

Bush signed a law in 1995 allowing Texans to carry concealed

handguns for the first time in 125 years. In 1997, he signed

another law that let people carry their handguns in churches,

nursing homes, and amusement parks. With this budget, President

Bush is apparently adding schools to the list of places where he

thinks more guns will make us safer."
