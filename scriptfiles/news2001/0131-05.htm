- January 31 - Responding to the

Bush &#145;Helping Hand' proposal released this week, Senator Paul

Wellstone and members of the Progressive Caucus today unveiled

comprehensive Medicare prescription drug legislation. Synthesizing

the best and most innovative policy ideas from the debate surrounding

the prescription drug issue, the bill addresses the twin problems of

affordable prescription drug coverage for millions of America's

senior citizens, and inflated U.S. prices for medications.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is time to make prescription drugs

affordable for America's senior citizens, millions of whom live on

fixed incomes while the cost of often life-saving drugs skyrockets

year after year. President Bush's proposal fails to get us there. Our

proposal will cover all seniors on Medicare, is affordable and safe,

and has good cost containment measures. This is a real prescription

drug benefit, and a big improvement over the White House plan,"

said Wellstone.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast to the Bush plan, which only covers

seniors who make less than $15,000, the progressive package covers

all Medicare beneficiaries and would pay for 80% of drug costs, and

at a comparable price to the federal government. Unlike the Bush

proposal which seeks to throw billions of dollars of taxpayer money

to the pharmaceutical industry without regard to the overall price of

prescription drugs, the progressive plan employs common-sense

cost-containment measures such as:</font></P>

<UL>

   

<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">volume pricing discounts which allow

   seniors to purchase their prescription drugs at the best price

   that the federal government pays when it purchases medications for

   VA Hospitals and Medicaid<BR>

   </font></LI>

<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">reasonable pricing agreements when NIH

   enters into agreements with commercial drug companies to bring

   NIH-researched drugs to market<BR>

   </font></LI>

<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">closing the loopholes in the Prescription

   Drug Importation Act</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone will introduce legislation in the

Senate to accomplish these goals shortly. </font>
