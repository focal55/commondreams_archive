- May 16 -  The nonprofit Center 

for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) today launched an 

Internet site to provide information about the links between 

hundreds of scientists -- mostly in the fields of nutrition, 

environment, toxicology, and medicine -- and corporations. The 

site is freely available at <a href="http://www.integrityinscience.org">www.integrityinscience.org</a> </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This site also provides information about some of the 

corporate support received by dozens of professional, health, 

and nonprofit organizations, including such organizations as the 

International Life Sciences Institute, American Council on 

Science and Health, and American Dietetic Association. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobson said: 

&quot;Corporations increasingly are funding academic scientists to 

conduct research, speak at press conferences, and provide 

advice. Too frequently, neither the scientists nor the 

corporations disclose that funding. Today, we have begun to lift 

that veil of secrecy by providing journalists, activists, policy 

makers, and the public with information about the links between 

more than 1,100 scientists and industry. The list will be 

expanded in the coming months. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Important health and environmental policies can be distorted 

by scientists who assert objectivity, but who receive funding 

from affected industries. The result could be more pollution, 

unsafe food additives, and dangerous consumer products,&quot; said 

Jacobson. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concern about scientific conflicts of interest has soared in 

recent years, thanks in part to controversies such as the New 

England Journal of Medicine's failure to enforce its disclosure 

guidelines and the University of Pennsylvania's failure to 

adequately disclose its conflicts to a patient who died during 

a clinical drug trial. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently, a controversy has swirled around John Graham, 

who directs the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which receives 

substantial funding from over 100 companies and trade 

associations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This week, a Senate committee will consider Graham's 

nomination to an important position in the Office of Management 

and Budget. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ronald Collins, director of CSPI's Integrity in Science 

project, said: &quot;We hope that this Web site will encourage 

journalists to report on scientists' funding from industry. All 

too often reporters quote scientists without providing the 

public with needed information about their ties to industry, 

thus giving the impression that they have no such affiliations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Of course, just because a scientist receives industry 

funding does not necessarily mean that he or she is biased or 

wrong. Rather, receipt of such funding is one of many factors 

that need to be considered in evaluating a scientist's 

statements,&quot; added Collins. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Helping reporters spot possible corporate puppets 

masquerading as independent scientists is an important advance 

for democracy,&quot; said Morton Mintz, former Washington Post 

reporter and former chair of the Fund for Investigative 

Journalism. &quot;CSPI,&quot; he added &quot;deserves profound thanks from the 

press and public.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since no laws make public the financial conflicts of 

interest that exist among academic scientists,&quot; noted Professor 

Sheldon Krimsky of Tufts University, &quot;CSPI's data base provides 

a valuable way for citizens and the media to gain a better 

understanding of an important source of bias in science and 

policy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Center for Science in the Public Interest encourages the 

use of science for the betterment of the public health and the 

environment. CSPI is well-known for winning passage of 

legislation requiring &quot;Nutrition Facts&quot; food labels and for its 

studies of the nutritional quality of restaurant foods. It also 

has projects on antibiotic resistance and alcohol problems. It 

is supported by the more than 800,000 subscribers to its 

Nutrition Action Healthletter and by charitable foundations; 

CSPI does not accept funding from industry or government. </i></font></p>
