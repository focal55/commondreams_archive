<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 5 - The National Abortion 

Federation (NAF) today commended law enforcement officials who 

captured Clayton Lee Waagner, a domestic terrorist who has claimed 

responsibility for over 550 anthrax threat letters sent to abortion 

providers in October and November. The letters were signed by the 

Army of God, a domestic terrorist organization. &quot;We are pleased 

that law enforcement officials have apprehended Clayton Waagner so 

that he cannot carry out his threats to murder forty-two 

individuals working at abortion clinics around the country,&quot; stated 

Vicki Saporta, the Executive Director of NAF. &quot;We are hopeful that 

law enforcement officials will also be able to identify and 

apprehend any others who assisted Waagner in sending the anthrax 

threat letters and evading capture for so many months.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The anthrax threat letters sent to abortion clinics did not test 

positive for anthrax, but Waagner has said he would not hesitate to 

use anthrax if he had access to it. Members of the Army of God 

have praised his actions and also support the use of anthrax in 

attempts to terrorize staff at abortion clinics. &quot;It is important 

that Waagner was apprehended before he could use real anthrax to 

threaten the lives of not only women's reproductive health care 

providers, but also mail handlers, emergency response teams and the 

general public,&quot; said Saporta. Continuing, Saporta said, &quot;Although 

we are pleased that Waagner will no longer be able to carry out 

acts of terrorism, only when we stop the activities of domestic 

terrorist organizations like the Army of God can we truly put an 

end to the violence against women's reproductive health care 

providers.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saporta emphasized that women's reproductive health care 

providers would not be deterred as a result of anti-choice 

terrorism. &quot;Our members will continue to remain open to provide 

necessary reproductive health care services to women.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clayton Waagner escaped from federal prison in February and was 

finally apprehended today at a Kinko's in Cincinnati. For the past 

ten months while Waagner evaded law enforcement, he has stolen 

several vehicles and committed bank robberies in North Dakota, West 

Virginia and Pennsylvania. </font></p>
