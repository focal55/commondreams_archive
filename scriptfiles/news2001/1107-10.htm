Communications coordinator at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Lilliston said

today: "The form of globalization represented by the WTO will do little to

lessen the threat of terrorism. In fact, it is driving greater divisions

between the rich and poor -- between developed and developing countries."

Director of the Trade Program for IATP, Murphy said today: "Despite the

collapse of the WTO talks in Seattle, it seems developed countries' governments

have learned nothing. We are now presented with a text that several developing

countries have rejected outright, and which fails to reflect the positions of

the Africa Group. The General Council has been bypassed by a process of

one-on-one and then small group meetings, as well as mini-ministerials which

were not open to all members.... Trade rules for agriculture must address

dumping of agricultural products in the international system. The lack of

competition in international commodity markets ensures an asymmetric division

of profits; that benefits agribusiness rather than producers or

consumers."

Ziad Abdel Samad is executive director of the Arab NGO Network for Development, a coalition of human rights, environmental, labor and other groups that has co-organized an

NGO forum in Beirut which ends Thursday. He will be in Doha, Qatar for the WTO

meeting. He said today: "The majority of the developing countries that

have joined the WTO are calling to stop and assess the impact of the implementation

of WTO agreements on the social and economic effects of trade agreements...

They are also calling for the reassessment of the mechanisms of the WTO,

especially those related to participation in the decision-making process and

the dispute settlement body in the WTO."

Co-director of Essential Action, Weissman said today: "Confronted with the prospect of

bioterrorism on a massive scale, the Bush administration and the pharmaceutical

industry have colluded to protect patent monopolies at the expense of public

health. The administration has refused to take steps to authorize competitive

generic production of Cipro to ensure an adequate supply of the product.... Now

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick is hard at work in the WTO

negotiations to deny poor countries the policy tools -- including the early

introduction of generic competition -- they need to make essential medicines

more accessible. These disputes are about corporate profit versus public

health, clean and simple."

Editor of <I>Left Business Observer</I>, Henwood said today: "In this time of crisis,

opportunism is everywhere, with lobbyists using the dismal economy as an excuse

to shake loose giant tax breaks from Congress, and the free trade crowd using

global recession and even the 'war on terrorism' as excuses to promote a whole

new trade round. Their brand of neoliberalism has given us a vast polarization

of incomes and regular financial crises, but they assure us that the only cure

is more of the same."
