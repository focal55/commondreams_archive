<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK  

- April 13 - At the outset of NATO's Kosovo bombing campaign in 1999, FAIR urged

journalists not to oversimplify the conflict. At the time, U.S. coverage

took a  propagandistic tone-- blaming a long-standing, multi-faceted

conflict almost entirely on the Serbs, or even solely on one man, Slobodan

Milosevic. FAIR pointed to the region's complex history of ethnic

confrontation, including the chronic turmoil of the 1980s, when it was the

Albanian majority, then enjoying broad political autonomy, that was accused

of discrimination and abuses aimed at driving out the Slavic minority.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the jingoistic atmosphere of the NATO war against Yugoslavia, much of the

media portrayed the conflict as little more than a racial pogrom

orchestrated by the Serbs for the simple purpose of satisfying their own

consuming hatreds. The fact that Serbian atrocities were taking place in the

context of a full-scale armed Albanian guerrilla insurgency was often

strangely missing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now an almost identical ethnic clash has erupted in neighboring Macedonia,

but the press's coverage is almost a reverse mirror image of its Kosovo

reporting. In each case, reporters and pundits have deferred to U.S.

officials' view of the situation: While the war in Kosovo was blamed on the

Serbian authorities (rather than the Albanian guerrillas), blame for today's

clashes in Macedonia is placed mostly on the shoulders of the Albanian

insurgents rather than the pro-NATO government. Whereas in Kosovo, Serbian

repression and human rights abuses were the main focus of attention, today

Macedonia's repression of Albanians is being downplayed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In October 1997, when the Kosovo Liberation Army first began shooting at

Serbian police and civilian officials, New York Times editorialists

(10/23/97) blamed the Serbs. They wrote that the disturbances proved &quot;the

adage that those who make peaceful revolutions impossible make violent ones

inevitable.&quot; Since 1989, the editorial explained, Albanians had been

peacefully campaigning for a restoration of Kosovo's political autonomy, but&quot;recently some Albanians, frustrated that politics is getting them nowhere,

have turned to attacks&quot; on the Serbian government.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The editorial condemned the Serbs' response as &quot;indiscriminate repression&quot;--

though by that point, very early in the conflict, Serbia's heavy-handed

police maneuvers had caused few civilian deaths-- and called on Washington

to &quot;increase the pressure on Belgrade&quot; to carry out reforms and allow

international monitors. No pressure or demands on the Albanian militants

were urged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contrast that with a recent Times editorial (3/13/01) on the sudden wave of

Albanian guerrilla attacks in Macedonia. Far from accusing the Macedonian

government of provoking Albanians' anger, the editorialists declared that&quot;the West must make clear to this militant [Albanian] fringe that they will

not be allowed to set off another Balkan war.... Macedonia itself must

summon the political and military strength needed to blunt this

challenge.... Responsible Albanian political leaders in Kosovo must now be

equally forthright in isolating the armed militants.... If they cannot do so

effectively, NATO may have to increase its military pressure on the

guerrillas.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet just like the Kosovars, the Albanians of Macedonia have taken up arms

after disillusionment with years of what they see as fruitless political

dialogue amid constant Slavic police brutality. Kim Mehmeti, a prominent

Albanian-language journalist and director of an NGO promoting inter-ethnic

cooperation in Skopje, explained this disillusionment in a recent commentary

for the Institute for War &amp; Peace Reporting (&quot;Futile Dialogue Exposed,&quot;

3/21/01). He wrote that the rebellion is &quot;forcing the country to look itself

in the mirror and to realize that inter-ethnic talks over the past 10 years

have taken place against a backdrop of police repression of the Albanian

community.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Macedonian abuses against ethnic Albanians have garnered little attention in

the U.S. This is in marked contrast to neighboring Kosovo, where Serbian

brutality was virtually the only aspect of the province's political

situation that caught the U.S. media's interest. Yet while Kosovo may have

featured more frequent nationalist flare-ups than Macedonia-- accompanied by

more frequent police repression-- human rights organizations and activists

like Mehmeti have documented a long and persistent record of ethnic abuses

by the Macedonian authorities since the republic's founding in 1991 that

have been all but ignored in the U.S.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, in 1992 a group of Albanian intellectuals sought to reopen the

Albanian-language teachers' college that had been closed since a 1986

crackdown. After two years with no response from the Macedonian government,

they opened Tetovo University on their own. According to Mehmeti, &quot;While

'democratic dialogue' continued over the future of the institution, police

were dispatched to forcibly shut down the university.  This dialogue,&quot; he

noted bitterly, &quot;ended in the death of one Albanian [and] the detention of

some of the university's organizers.... The Macedonian state has yet to recognize the institution.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997, police intervened in the Albanian village of Gostivar to remove an

Albanian flag from a municipal building. According to Human Rights Watch,&quot;at least two hundred people were injured.... The police shot dead two men

and beat a third to death.&quot; Gostivar's mayor was arrested and charged with&quot;organizing an armed resistance.&quot; Police &quot;continued to detain, interrogate,

and abuse ethnic Albanians&quot; for weeks, including several Albanian political

activists who were &quot;beaten and then released without any formal charges

having been made against them.&quot; HRW added that the police contingent

included &quot;special forces trained by the United States.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 2000, a wave of police repression targeted the Albanian village

of Aracinovo after the murder of three Macedonian police officers there.

According to Amnesty International, &quot;dozens of people-- all of them ethnic

Albanian...were tortured, beaten, or otherwise ill-treated.... Many men were

held incommunicado for up to 11 days.... One man had his jaw broken,

reportedly with a rifle butt,&quot; and there were &quot;strong indications&quot; that one

man who died in custody &quot;may have been extrajudicially executed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International monitors recently reported the killing of a 16-year-old ethnic

Albanian boy returning home to tend to his sheep, as well as the &quot;arrest and

beating of scores of ethnic Albanian civilians, and the vandalizing of

dozens of houses&quot; (London Guardian, 4/10/01). In an ominous move reminiscent

of the Serbian crackdown in Kosovo, dozens of Albanian teachers, lawyers and

other community leaders have recently been rounded up and arrested by

Macedonian authorities on vague charges of &quot;terrorism&quot; (&quot;Arrests Panic

Albanians,&quot; IWPR, 4/5/01). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These incidents received virtually no coverage in the U.S. media, and

reporters writing about the current rebellion have largely tiptoed around

the subject. In a piece about the mobilization for war among ethnic Albanian

expatriates in the U.S., the New York Times' Chris Hedges (3/19/01) tersely

noted that Albanians in Macedonia &quot;complain of discrimination and harassment

from Macedonia's Slav majority.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet during the Kosovo war, Hedges spoke passionately about pre-war abuses in

Serb-ruled Kosovo, calling it &quot;a phenomenally repressive and brutal

government,&quot; and argued that &quot;the Serbs forfeited their right to rule Kosovo

by that kind of behavior&quot; (NPR's Talk of the Nation, 6/7/99).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What explains the media's reluctance to condemn abuses in Macedonia as

forcefully as they did the Serbian crackdown in Kosovo? As usual, reporters

and editors seem to be taking their cues from U.S. policymakers. In the

Kosovo conflict, secretary of state Madeleine Albright and her aides were

determined to paint the Yugoslav leadership as the main culprit behind the

war in order to prepare the ground for NATO intervention on &quot;humanitarian&quot;

grounds. &quot;Our first priority,&quot; one of Albright's top deputies has written,&quot;was to unite the Europeans behind air strikes by clearly defining the

aggressor and the victim&quot; (James Rubin, Financial Times, 9/30/00). At every

opportunity, these officials worked to draw attention to Serbian abuses and

were reticent about KLA provocations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By contrast, Macedonia is viewed by U.S. policymakers across the political

spectrum as a loyal regional partner of NATO and a bulwark against

instability. Far from hoping to launch &quot;humanitarian&quot; airstrikes against the

country, U.S. and European officials have acted to shore up the shaky

Macedonian government. &quot;Instead of criticizing human rights violations,&quot;

Human Rights Watch has written, &quot;the international community has rewarded

the Macedonian government for being a 'factor of stability' in the region.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But journalists should not let the calculations of policy planners influence

their coverage of human rights issues in the Balkans. Violence on both sides

must be reported, and the grievances of each side examined. Just as the

media were irresponsible in framing the Kosovo war as a simple story of

Serbian violence against Albanians, they should not play down the very real

abuses being committed against Albanians by the pro-NATO government of

Macedonia.</font></p>
