<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 20 - Public Citizen is urging lawmakers to balance the needs of

financially strapped airlines with those of taxpayers and other businesses when

considering a multibillion-dollar bailout package for the industry. Airlines should not

leverage public concern over last week&#146;s terrorist attacks to compensate for other

financial demands, the organization said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/press/pr-air1a.htm">letter</a> sent Thursday to

lawmakers, Public Citizen asked Congress to ensure that the need for financial assistance

for the airlines be fully documented, so that the size and shape of a bailout is dictated

by facts, not the airline industry&#146;s wish list. Claims of what the attacks cost the

airlines should be independently verified through the General Accounting Office, the

Department of Transportation&#146;s Inspector General or other independent sources, Public

Citizen said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Like the rest of the country, we are still reeling from last week&#146;s events,

and it is understandable that Congress wants to respond quickly,&quot; said Public Citizen

President Joan Claybrook. &quot;But we must be careful to protect taxpayers too. We may

need to help airlines with their short-term needs resulting from the terrorist attacks,

but the financial information is still murky. Lawmakers should see the financial data

behind the airlines&#146; claims before acting.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any aid given now should be for a maximum of six months, because estimates of losses a

year from now are hypothetical and difficult to predict, said the letter, signed by

Claybrook and Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch Director Frank Clemente.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We just don&#146;t know enough to ask taxpayers to fork over billions of dollars

to cover losses that may or may not occur next spring or summer,&quot; Claybrook said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Public Citizen made the following requests:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress should ensure that any bailout will not be used to give top executives big

    bonuses and raises, or to give the industry increased profits;</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any aid should be conditioned on the airlines&#146; support of federal efforts to

    improve airport security measures. The airline industry in the past has fought improved

    airline and airport security recommendations;</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lawmakers should remember the economic needs of a variety of large and small businesses

    hurt by the attacks. Also, when discussing transportation subsidies, lawmakers should

    consider alternate means of transportation, such as Amtrak;</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress should not grant any shield for airlines from liability arising from the

    attacks, particularly since there is no information available now about their culpability;</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The airline industry should not be granted immunity from anti-trust laws, because this

    likely would lead to artificially higher prices and could lead to collaboration on prices;</font></p>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<blockquote>

    

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress must enact a Passengers&#146; Bill of Rights that would ensure passengers get

    timely and truthful information about flight delays, as well as permission to deplane and

    use food and sanitation facilities when a flight is delayed for an unreasonable amount of

    time, as is more likely to happen with stricter security measures.</font></p>
