- May 24 - The shift in control of the U.S. Senate will create an environment more favorable for issues important to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community and to progressive allies, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. James M. Jeffords today announced he will withdraw from the Republican Party, become an Independent and vote with the Democrats on organizational matters. The move, which effectively gives the Democrats a 51-49 majority, means that Sen. Tom Daschle will become the Majority Leader and that Democrats will have the power to name the chairs of all Senate committees. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the shift, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-VT., will replace Sen. Orrin Hatch as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. This is the committee that votes on George W. Bush's judicial nominations. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-MA, will become chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. This committee considers a number of measures important to the GLBT community, ranging from nondiscrimination laws to school safety to programs that fight HIV and AIDS. Sen. Joe Biden, D-DE., will replace Sen. Jesse Helms as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Helms is one of the senators who held up the nomination of James Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg during the Clinton administration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The new composition of the Senate will serve as a brake on Bush's more radical proposals,&quot; said NGLTF Political Director Tim McFeeley. &quot;It will mean that Bush's nominees, particularly for the judiciary, will receive more careful scrutiny. It will mean that pro-GLBT measures, like the proposed hate crimes law, safe schools legislation, bans on discrimination and pro-GLBT immigration measures could stand a better chance of at least being aired for debate. All in all, this change will make the U.S. Senate more compassionate and less conservative.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGLTF maintains &quot;W Watch,&quot; a web site devoted to tracking Bush&#146;s nominees and initiatives that could affect the GLBT community. To visit W. Watch, simply go to <a href="http://www.ngltf.org">www.ngltf.org</a> and click on the &quot;W&quot; button. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. </i></font></p>
