- April 6 - Fans at Miller Park today will see President George W. Bush throw out the

first pitch -- and they'll receive collectors' baseball cards spotlighting

Bush's record of striking out on the environment.  Sierra Club volunteers

will be handing out the baseball cards to fans as they arrive because

people in Milwaukee deserve to know President Bush's score on protecting

our air and water and the environment.

<p>

"These cards ask President Bush to quit dropping the call on protecting our

environment, our families, and our future," said Penny Bernard Schaber,

chair of the Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter.  "Bush is striking out on clean

water, clean air, and protecting the Great Lakes."

<p>

The cards highlight recent Bush decisions to:

-- reject sensible clean up of cancer-causing arsenic in drinking water

-- break his promise to reduce global warming air pollution, and

-- move forward on his support for oil drilling in fragile lands that

America treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, western public

lands, and perhaps even the Great Lakes.

<p>

"Bush is switch hitting on the environment, promising to protect our

environment but instead weakening safeguards for arsenic in our drinking

water and allowing more global warming air pollution," said Steve Schutz,

chair of the Sierra Club Milwaukee Group.  "We drink the water from Lake

Michigan and the Great Lakes.  President Bush should fight to keep oil

pollution out of our water, not put it at risk.  The mining, chemical and

utility industries that donated millions to President Bush's campaign got

what they paid for."
