- February 7 - The California Fourth District Court of Appeal has ruled

that Proposition 21, the Juvenile Crime initiative passed by voters in

March 2000, is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers

provision of the state constitution.  The Court said that the portion of

Proposition 21 which  transferred from judges to district attorneys the

decision of whether to prosecute a juvenile as an adult was essentiallya sentencing decision, which is the constitutional province of the

courts. If a juvenile is convicted in juvenile court, the sentence can

range from counseling to serving time in a juvenile detention center.

If a juvenile is convicted in adult court of the same crime, thoseoptions are no longer available, and sentences are served in adult

prisons.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ruling comes in the case of  Manduley/Rose v. Superior Court of San

Diego County in which eight San Diego juveniles have been charged as

adults in the alleged beating and robbing of five elderly Latino migrant

workers last July.  In September, a  judge of the Fourth District Court

of Appeal issued an emergency stay in the proceedings in order to allow

the constitutional issues to be decided before the youths enter pleas in

adult court.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today the court re-affirmed a basic principle underlying our system of

government &#151; that the authority to prosecute someone for a crime and the

responsibility for sentencing the guilty should not

be placed in the same hands,&quot; says William LaFond, attorney for Morgan

Manduley, one of the juveniles.  &quot; The decision of whether or not to

prosecute a juvenile as an adult is, in effect, a sentencing decision,

because it pre-determines what will happen to a young person if he or

she is convicted.  Proposition 21 took that authority away from an

impartial judge and gave it to the district attorney, who is bydefinition a biased advocate in an adversarial system.  The Court, by

striking down Prop 21, restored the proper balance to our system.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The defendants' legal team was joined in challenging Proposition 21 by

the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a friend-of-the-court

brief.  The ACLU also filed a constitutional challenge to the measure

immediately following its passage.  Today's case, if it is appealed, is

almost certain to be the first to reach the California Supreme Court,where a final determination of the constitutional issues will be made.</font></p>
