- September 12 - The state's largest peace 

organization today issued a statement of opposition to potential 

military strikes in response to the attacks on New York and 

Washington. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Ferenbach, California Peace Action's Executive Director 

explained, &quot;Our hearts and our prayers go out to the victims of the 

attacks in New York and Washington. Many people lost parents, 

children, sisters, brothers and friends. Nonetheless, there is no 

value in attacks that are destined to result in a further loss of 

innocent lives. To act with disregard for the lives of those who are 

not directly responsible for the attacks on the U.S. lowers us to the 

same level as those who perpetrated the barbarity of Tuesday's 

attacks.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action has mobilized a statewide phone bank to direct 

people's frustration and anger toward constructive responses. Staff 

and volunteers are making hundreds of phone calls to provide people 

with contact information for disaster relief organizations and blood 

banks in their immediate area. The organization is similarly 

directing people toward vigils and community gatherings in their 

area. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The best response to terrorism, is to affirm community and to 

call ourselves to a higher appreciation of our humanity. As Gandhi 

once wrote, 'An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind',&quot; said 

Danielle Babineau, Peace Action's Southern California Political 

Director. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In opposing possible air strikes, California Peace Action notes 

that such strikes would be a violation of international law. &quot;Compounding terrorism with vigilantism will only make a tragic 

situation worse,&quot; said Ferenbach. &quot;The appropriate course of action 

is to identify the individuals responsible for these atrocities and 

bring them to trial, not wreak vengeance upon the innocent and the 

guilty alike.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action also pointed out that past attacks on the United 

States have resulted in assaults on people who were victimized for no 

reason other than the color of their skin or their national origin. 

In a statement, the organization declared &quot;We call upon our fellow 

citizens to vocally and physically oppose the likely violence that 

will be directed at Moslems and people of Middle Eastern origin.&quot; </font></p>
