- November 17 - On Nov. 16, 1989, in El Salvador army officers trained at the 

School of the Americas (SOA) massacred six Jesuit priests and their 

two housekeepers in El Salvador. Every November since then SOA 

Watch, a grassroots human rights group, has commemorated that event 

with demonstrations and funeral processions at Ft. Benning, the 

home of the SOA, on the outskirts of Columbus. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1990 SOA Watch has been a persistent critic of the School. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOA Watch founder Fr. Roy Bourgeois refers to the School as &quot;the 

terrorist training camp right here in our own backyard.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year the City of Columbus sought an injunction forbidding 

Bourgeois and other SOA Watch organizers from taking part in the 

procession at the entrance to Ft. Benning. Yesterday, on the 12th 

anniversary of the Jesuit massacre, Federal Magistrate G. Mallon 

Faircloth denied the City's request. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Faircloth said that even war cannot remove safeguards for civil 

liberties. &quot;It was a question of First Amendment rights, and you 

can't play with that. I am sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution. 

I think I did that today,&quot; said the Judge, who last May found 26 

SOA Watch demonstrators guilty of trespass for participating in 

last November's nonviolent funeral procession. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty of those demonstrators are currently in federal prisons 

serving six-month sentences. They are among the 70 SOA Watch 

activists who since 1990 have cumulatively spent 40 years in prison 

for their scrupulously nonviolent protests against the SOA 

(recently renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 

Cooperation). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tomorrow's funeral procession will begin at 8:30 AM at Columbus' 

Main Gate Plaza, at the corner of Victory Drive and Ft. Benning Rd, 

a half mile from the Ft. Benning main entrance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOA Watch, founded in 1990, is a national, grassroots, faith and 

conscience-based group committed to nonviolence. SOA Watch has 

offices in Columbus, Ga., Washington, D.C., and chapters in 

communities and on campuses around the country. Its goal is to 

expose and close SOA/WHISC. </font></p>
