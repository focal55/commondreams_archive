- July 13 - Following the announcement by the International Olympic

Committee to award China with the 2008 Olympic Games, U.S. Senator Paul

Wellstone (D-MN), Chairman of the Senate Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs

Subcommittee, today expressed his strong disappointment with the move. 

Wellstone said China&#146;s chronic failure to respect human rights &#150; as documented

again this year by the State Department &#150; violates the spirit of the Games and

should have eliminated Beijing as a finalist to host the Games.  Wellstone was

the lead cosponsor of the bipartisan S. Con. Res. 28 which called on the

International Olympic Committee not to name Beijing as host until China releases

all political prisoners, ratifies the International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights, and observes international norms of human rights. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While today&#146;s decision by the IOC is a setback for the cause of human rights,

it also presents an opportunity for the U.S. government and the international

community to demand that the Chinese government improve its human rights record

before the games begin.  The value of these Olympic games to the government of

China cannot be overestimated.  Its chronic failure to respect human rights 

violates the fundamental spirit of the Olympics and should have disqualified

China,&#148; Wellstone said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many members of Congress argue that human rights should never be a consideration

in  determining U.S. trade relations with other countries. However, a

government&#146;s record on human rights, Wellstone holds, should not  be ignored

with respect to choosing a sight for the Olympics &#150;  which confers enormous

prestige on the host government and which is intended to celebrate human dignity

and achievement. The Olympic charter makes clear &#147;respect for universal

fundamental ethical principles&#148; are central to the Olympic ideal.  According to

the U.S. State Department, during the past year, the Chinese government&#146;s record

&#145;worsened&#146; as it committed &#145;numerous serious abuses&#146;.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is just the beginning.  The U.S. government has eight years to keep the

pressure on China for its human rights performance, and a tremendous opportunity

to insist that the Chinese government end the repression of its people.  I will

work in the Senate to see that we do so.  And I long for the day when I can

stand on the Senate floor and celebrate the idea of China hosting the games. The

Chinese people are some of the most extraordinary, talented and resourceful

people on the planet.  But I believe that day should only come when the Chinese

government&#146;s record on human rights is not a list of horrors,&#148; Wellstone said.
