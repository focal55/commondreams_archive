- May 7 - Household International, parent company of two of the

country's biggest predatory lenders, Household Finance and

Beneficial, is holding its annual shareholders' meeting on May

8 in the Tampa, Fla., area. As part of ACORN's ongoing campaign

to urge Household to change its predatory lending practices,

more than 50 ACORN members and victims of Household plan to

protest outside the gathering. ACORN will present Household with

its "Shark of the Year" award.

<p>Present will be these victims of Household: Margaret Dickens

(from St. Louis), Amy Swanson (St. Paul), and Rudy Tachias

(Albuquerque). Massachusetts ACORN leader Angie Wilkerson will

be speaking inside the shareholders' meeting.

<p>Events are also scheduled for the 8th and 9th in:



Albuquerque, Boston, St. Louis, Hempstead (NY), Minneapolis and

St. Paul (MN), Little Rock, Hartford, Denver, San Diego, and Los

Angeles. ACORN members and allied elected officials will

announce a drive to urge cities to divest their retirement and

other funds from Household until and unless it puts a stop to

its abusive lending.

&nbsp;

<p>When:

<br>9 a.m., May 8.

<p>Where:

<br>Household's facility at 636 Grand Regency Blvd.

<br>Brandon, Fla. 33510.

<p>Inside the shareholders' meeting in Florida, members of

executive compensation review to study ways of linking a portion

of Household's executives' compensation to curbing its predatory

lending.
