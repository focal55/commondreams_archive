States participated in various rallies and other

events this past weekend urging the U.S. to avoid

military strikes and incursions in retaliation for the

September 11 attacks.  Greens call for an

international response based on justice instead of

vengeance, a response that avoids further shedding of

innocent blood -- including more American casualties

-- and which does everything possible to avert war.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party opposes military strikes,&quot; said Anita

Rios, an Ohio Green and member of the party's national

steering committee.  &quot;The only truly patriotic

strategy is one in which peace is the outcome.  Peace

is the only outcome that can guarantee the safety of

all Americans, justice for the victims of the terrible

attacks and their survivors, and relief for Afghanis

suffering an economic disaster under a repressive

regime.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Party organizers held a national Green forum on a

democratic response to the current crisis on Saturday,

at the University of the District of Columbia.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sam Smith, author, journalist, and editor of The

Progressive Review (&lt;http://prorev.com&gt;) and a guest

speaker at the forum, said, &quot;We will not accept

lectures about patriotism from those who have spent

the last decade undermining American democracy and

sovereignty in the name of free trade.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens note that a schism has grown within the Bush

Administration on how the U.S will deal with terrorism

and the recent attacks.  On one side, Secretary of

State Colin Powell counsels a NATO-based policy, with

international cooperation and a temporary delay of

counterstrikes.  President Bush himself expressed this

approach in his address to the nation on September 20.

 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other side of the schism is reflected in the

recommendations of Deputy Defense Secretary Paul

Wolfowitz to treat the September 11 attacks as a

conventional war and commence retaliatory assaults as

soon as possible.  This view is supported by

bloodthirsty calls for war from some op-ed pages, and

by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who said

on September 23 that the U.S. wouldn't rule out a

nuclear strike (CBS Face the Nation).  Wolfowitz has

urged strikes against Iraq, despite the lack of

evidence of Iraq's complicity in the September 11

attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party calls for a response that will

prevent war and will promote justice,&quot; said Jane

Hunter, Vice-Chair of the Green Party of New Jersey. 

&quot;We caution against strikes, regardless of which body

undertakes them.  These will inevitably lead to more

deaths of civilians, as in the U.S. and NATO raids

against Iraq and the Balkans during the 1990s.  The

U.S. definition of terrorism is likely to include acts

committed against the U.S. and its close allies (such

as western Europe and Israel), but not attacks for

which the U.S. and its close allies bear some

responsibility.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If bin Laden masterminded the September 11 attacks,

he should be tried for crimes against humanity by an

international tribunal.  It is sad and ironic that the

U.S. has been reluctant in the past to support such a

body.  Greens call for immediate support for a

tribunal such as the International Criminal Court. 

Treating the attacks as international crimes against

humanity instead of acts of war will ensure us the

cooperation of Muslim states and the rest of the

world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens insist that the U.S. and international

community must apply the definition of terrorism and

the rule of international law consistently around the

globe. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. should take the lead by being responsibile

for our own policies,&quot; said Starlene Rankin, Illinois

Green Party Media Coordinator.  &quot;And let's work to

create a non-violent, non-militarist society where we

make the effort to resolve conflicts peacefully.&quot;  </font></p>
