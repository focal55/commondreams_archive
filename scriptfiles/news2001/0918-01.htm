- September 18 -  

As Indonesian president Megawati Sukarnoputri 

prepared to meet President Bush, the Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN) 

and the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) urged the Bush administration not 

to strengthen ties with the Indonesian military. Citing ongoing human 

rights abuses and lack of accountability for violations, the groups said 

renewing military relations with Indonesia would set back reform efforts 

and democracy in Indonesia while undermining East Timor's security.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In its drive to build an international coalition in response to the 

horrible attacks in New York and Washington, the U.S. must not sacrifice 

the rights of Indonesians and East Timorese,&quot; said Kurt Biddle, Washington 

Coordinator for IHRN. &quot;Renewal of military ties with the brutal Indonesian 

military will only encourage their terror tactics against the people of 

Aceh, West Papua and elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since Megawati assumed Indonesia's presidency in late July, the Bush 

administration has stepped up efforts to restore a closer relationship 

between the Pentagon and the Indonesian military (TNI). She is scheduled to 

meet President Bush on Wednesday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Megawati has belatedly recognized East Timor's independence and recently 

met its leaders. However, the Indonesian military, which played an active 

role in the destabilization of her predecessor, continues to thwart 

attempts at democratic reform,&quot; said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We feel great sorrow for the loss of life in New York, Washington, DC, and 

Pennsylvania. We also mourn the loss of East Timorese and Indonesian lives 

at the hands of the Indonesian military. At this time, the U.S. government 

must continue to withhold aid for this deadly force.  Increased assistance 

for the TNI by the U.S. military will only lead to further loss of innocent 

civilians,&quot; said Biddle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to the horrific attacks on September 11, IHRN canceled its planned 

public demonstration at the Indonesian Embassy during President Megawati's 

visit to Washington. The group stressed, however, that their message to Ms. 

Megawati remains the same.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Indonesian military has answered to no one for their crimes against 

humanity and they continue to kill hundreds of civilians. Nothing has 

changed as far as human rights are concerned. Now is not the time to reward 

this brutal force,&quot; said Biddle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States has withheld most military assistance from Indonesia 

since the TNI and its militia proxies razed East Timor in September 1999 

after it voted overwhelmingly for independence. Congress restricted most 

military assistance through the &quot;Leahy conditions,&quot; first passed in late 

1999. These conditions include the safe return of East Timorese refugees, 

prosecution of those responsible for atrocities in East Timor and 

Indonesia, and security for East Timor from military and militia activity. 

None of these conditions have been met. The full U.S. House of 

Representatives and the Senate Appropriations Committee recently voted to 

renew these restrictions, with the Senate committee adding additional 

conditions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last spring, James Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, told 

Congress, &quot;To date, the Government of Indonesia has not met the 

requirements of the Leahy amendment in pursuing accountability for human 

rights abuses by the TNI in East Timor or elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesian military and police continue to commit atrocities throughout 

the island nation. In Aceh, the armed forces' campaign against the local 

population continues. On August 9 in the town of Julok, armed men lined up 

local civilians and shot to death at least 30 men, wounding another nine. 

Eyewitnesses say the killers were TNI troops. Over 1,200 people, mostly 

civilians, have been killed in Aceh since the beginning of the year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although some refugees recently returned to East Timor, up to 80,000 remain 

trapped in poor conditions in Indonesian West Timor under the control of 

militia. Last week's return of refugees is the result of ongoing 

negotiations with militia leader, Cancio Lopes de Carvalho, who has 

declared his acceptance of East Timor's independence and offered to tell 

what he knows about the generals who ordered the 1999 violence. Other 

militia leaders, backed by elements of the Indonesian military, are 

reported to be biding their time in West Timor, awaiting a U.N. draw-down 

or withdrawal, before launching additional military raids across the border.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;East Timor has experienced terror of its own. Hundreds of thousands were 

killed, most of its infrastructure destroyed, and one-quarter of its 

population forcibly deported. The perpetrators of these crimes are well 

known,&quot; said Miller.  &quot;An international tribunal is the only way to bring 

to justice those who committed crimes against humanity in East Timor for so 

long.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Megawati administration's recently-amended decree establishing a 

special human rights court on East Timor in Indonesia falls far short of 

fully addressing the military's role in orchestrating the violence and 

devastation. Without an international tribunal, those most responsible for 

Indonesia's scorched earth campaign in East Timor will escape punishment,&quot; 

he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April, former Indonesian president Wahid issued a decree limiting the 

jurisdiction of the special court to crimes committed after the August 30, 

1999 popular consultation in East Timor. Megawati's expanded decree 

restricts the court's jurisdiction to crimes committed in Liquica, Dili, 

and Suai in the months of April and September 1999.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IHRN also pointed to the rise of political detainees and prisoners. 

&quot;Indonesia has regressed to the Suharto-era practice of arresting and 

imprisoning peaceful political dissidents,&quot; said Kurt Biddle. &quot;The military 

is attacking villagers as the police target the activists.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In August, Acehnese student activist Faisal Syaifuddin was arrested in 

Jakarta. In July, Kautsar [ed: one name] was arrested at a peaceful 

demonstration against ExxonMobil's human rights abuses in Aceh. Both 

activists are charged with &quot;inciting hatred&quot; against the government and are 

awaiting trial. Since mid-June, police have held 19 activists in Bandung, 

West Java for their involvement in protests of oil price increases. Eight 

people are being detained for distributing leaflets in Surabaya, East Java, 

including two provincial parliament representatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) supports human dignity for the 

people of East Timor by advocating for democracy, sustainable development, 

social, legal, and economic justice and human rights, including women's 

rights. ETAN, which has 28 local chapters throughout the U.S., calls for an 

international tribunal to prosecute crimes against humanity which took 

place in East Timor since 1975. For additional information see ETAN's web 

site (<a href="http://www.etan.org" target="_new">http://www.etan.org</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesia Human Rights Network (IHRN) is a U.S.-based grassroots 

organization working to educate and activate the American public and 

influence U.S. foreign policy and international economic interests to 

support democracy, demilitarization, and justice through accountability and 

rule of law in Indonesia. IHRN seeks to end armed forces repression in 

Indonesia by exposing it to international scrutiny. IHRN works with and 

advocates on behalf of people throughout the Indonesian archipelago to 

strengthen civil society. See <a href="http://www.IndonesiaNetwork.org" target="_new">www.IndonesiaNetwork.org</a> for more information.
