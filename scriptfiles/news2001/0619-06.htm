- June 19 - Today the Center for 

Marine Conservation became The Ocean Conservancy during a press 

conference where the new name, a new look, a new magazine, and a 

new focus were introduced. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our current name has served us well. But this is a new era -- 

the era of the oceans,&quot; said Roger Rufe, president, The Ocean 

Conservancy. &quot;Our new name more accurately reflects our new 

emphasis on conserving and protecting significant parts of our 

oceans. With it, we are building on our past success and reputation 

as the nation's oldest and largest marine conservation 

organization, and expanding to reflect our commitment to become 

even more effective 'advocates for wild, healthy oceans.'&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center for Marine Conservation has undertaken significant 

changes over the last year. These changes include a new president 

and a new senior leadership team to lead and direct the work of the 

organization. In addition, new staff positions have been created 

and the regional presence has been expanded, including a new office 

in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Changes also include finalizing a new 

strategic plan to strengthen and refine the focus of our ocean 

conservation work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We want people to look out on the ocean with a new appreciation 

for what lies under the surface of the water,&quot; said Rufe. &quot;The 

ocean seems so vast and unchanging on the surface, but underneath 

hides an underwater world full of mountains taller than Mt. 

Everest, canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon, volcanoes, geysers, 

and wide-open plains.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The health of the oceans is rapidly deteriorating. From water 

pollution to oil drilling, from commercial fishing to sea-borne 

shipping, from vessel groundings to invasive species, human 

activities have fundamentally altered the natural state of our 

oceans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That seemingly unchanging surface also hides an ugly truth,&quot; 

added Rufe. &quot;Our oceans are overfished, over polluted, and under 

protected. We must view the oceans in a new way -- not as an 

infinite and inexhaustible resource but as a national treasure, and 

a treasure that is at risk.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ocean Conservancy has chosen a circular symbol brimming with 

the vitality and complexity of ocean life as its logo. It reflects 

the conviction that healthy fish and wildlife cannot be separated 

from healthy water and ecosystems. Whales, sharks, and coral 

cannot be saved from extinction unless there are abundant food 

sources and safe habitat available. The symbol represents life 

forms from the magnificent to the ordinary -- whales to whelks, 

sharks to seagrass. The Ocean Conservancy is committed to them 

all. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also at today's press conference, The Ocean Conservancy launched 

a new, bold challenge to the American people and to the 

Administration -- a challenge to protect at least five percent of 

U.S. waters and key international sites as ocean wilderness. The 

Ocean Wilderness Challenge identified five U.S. sites and one 

Caribbean site that would form the ideal cornerstones of this 

strategy. These sites include areas to be selected within Glacier 

Bay and Prince William Sound in Alaska; the Northwestern Hawaiian 

Islands; the Channel Islands off the southern California coast; 

Florida's Dry Tortugas; and the San Andris Archipelago off the 

coast of Nicaragua. These six sites are unique and contribute 

immensely to the planet's overall health. In the months and years 

ahead, The Ocean Conservancy will work with local and national 

partners to achieve ocean wilderness within each of these flagship 

areas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Headquartered in Washington, D.C., The Ocean Conservancy has 

regional offices in Alaska, California, Florida, and Maine and 

field offices in Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, CA, Florida Keys, 

the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the office of Pollution Prevention and 

Monitoring in Virginia Beach, Va.</i></font></p>
