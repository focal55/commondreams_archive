- June 25 - Greenpeace research presented today in Italy shows how multinational companies like agrochemical giant DuPont are abusing patent laws for exclusive rights over crop biological diversity. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has issued a legal challenge to a DuPont patent with support from other Latin American organizations and the Mexican government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The research, revealed at the opening session of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Conference in Rome, Italy shows how multinational companies are trying to gain worldwide control over seed, food and feed through renewed lobby efforts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International Undertaking conference is trying to set global rules for conservation of biological diversity in crop plants and access to food production and seeds. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most critical issues at stake is the patentability of genes, plants and seeds. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Companies like Dupont are systematically claiming property rights on both genes which are not inventions, and also on conventionally bred plants. Such abuses clearly are acts of biopiracy, and many developing countries see it as the theft of their genetic resources by private companies based in the rich developed world, where their sole motivation is profit, &#148; said Christoph Then, Greenpeace expert on patents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increasingly, multinationals are taking genetic resources out of the public domain, and claim them as their private property through patent protection. Greenpeace is demanding that seeds, plants and gene sequences, in particular for crop plants should not be patented. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International Undertaking conference starting today should be seen to send a clear message and become a strong international framework to stop those patents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Living organisms and their genes should not be subjected to exclusive intellectual property rights such as patents, and a small group of countries and their multinational agriculture and biotechnology industries must not be allowed to turn biological diversity into private property and the pursuit of profit,&#148; added Then. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If this trend is not stopped, we will soon be facing the erosion of agricultural biodiversity, decreased food security, and loss of farmers&#146; livelihoods and rights,&#148; he added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With seven other international Non Government Organizations, Greenpeace demands the following: - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stop the sell-out of biological diversity; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stop intellectual property rights that restrict access to plant genetic resources; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stop patents on seeds, plants and gene sequences; and </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Create a legally binding framework for fair sharing of benefits arising from the use of crop plants in connection with international programs for the conservation of genetic resources in poor countries. </font></p>
