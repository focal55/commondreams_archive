- July 17 - &quot;The Sierra Club opposes HR 2436, Representative James Hansen's (R-UT) bill

being considered today in the House Resources Committee.  This bill's

'drill first, ask later' approach would destroy precious landscapes by

opening protected areas in Alaska to oil development, and setting the stage

for damaging development on public lands across the country.  Instead,

sensible solutions to America's energy needs lie in investing in

energy-efficient technologies, developing renewable resources like wind and

solar power, building cleaner and more efficient power plants, and focusing

on responsible production.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In addition to the legislation's controversial provision to allow oil

drilling in the Arctic Refuge, the Hansen bill will pillage our natural

heritage by weakening important land protection measures in the West, and

by considering some of our last pristine wild places for risky industrial

development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We don't believe that we need to sacrifice national treasures like the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to meet our country's energy needs.

Drilling the Arctic Refuge can not and will not solve our country's energy

woes but it will forever destroy one of our nation's last great wilderness

areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Government estimates predict less than a 6-month supply of oil may lie

beneath the fragile landscape of the Arctic Refuge and even the oil

industry itself admits that any oil discovered would take a decade to come

on line.  With 95 percent of Alaska's vast North Slope already available to

oil and gas leasing, the Sierra Club calls for permanent protection for the

coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, which represents the last five percent

that remains off-limits to drilling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We cannot drill our way out of the problem, no matter what this

legislation and the Bush Administration claim.  Our nation consumes 25

percent of the world's oil, yet we sit on less than three percent of the

world's known oil reserves.  To achieve true energy independence America

needs a quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer long-term energy strategy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Energy Plan and the Hansen Bill promote the wrong choices for

America's energy future.  We should not pillage our public lands for a

short-term fix of oil.  We need a long-term energy strategy based on

conservation, renewable energy, and stronger efficiency standards such as

making our cars and light-trucks go farther on a gallon of gas.  Such a

plan would save money, prevent pollution, and protect national treasures

like the Arctic Refuge for future generations.&quot;
