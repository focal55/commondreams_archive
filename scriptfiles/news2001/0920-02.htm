<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 20 - People For the American 

Way today joined a broad, ideologically diverse group of 

organizations to announce the &quot;In Defense of Freedom&quot; coalition. 

Coalition members will work together to ensure that regulatory and 

legislative responses to the recent terrorist attacks do not 

undermine Americans' constitutional rights and civil liberties. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is a statement by People For the American Way 

President Ralph G. Neas: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are proud to stand in defense of freedom with so many other 

friends and allies, as well as people with whom we frequently 

disagree on matters of public policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are united in our support for appropriate efforts to bring to 

justice the people who planned and helped carry out last week's 

brutal terrorist attacks. And we are united in our conviction that 

we must not allow our immediate pursuit of justice to do long-term 

damage to the basic rights and freedoms that are at the core of 

what it means to be an American. In order to minimize the risk of 

that kind of damage, it is important that Congress take the time to 

carefully examine the legislation -- some of it troubling -- that 

the administration is proposing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a time for bipartisanship, and we praise those political 

leaders who have drawn us together in the midst of overwhelming 

loss. But our commitment to serving the national interest in this 

time of crisis requires that we also be on guard against the 

potential for self-inflicted harm. We must not allow our own anger 

and fear to cause us to act in ways that violate Americans' civil 

liberties and erode the free society that Americans are rallying to 

defend. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are concerned about the potential for far-reaching 

consequences, perhaps unintended, when sweeping legislation is 

enacted swiftly. Because good intentions do not necessarily ensure 

good public policy, we call on members of Congress to carefully 

consider the implications of legislation that comes before them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, the administration's new legislative proposals 

seems to grant extraordinary power to the attorney general to 

detain people indefinitely on vaguely defined grounds, with limited 

judicial oversight. Rushing to vote on that kind of legislation 

without hearings or meaningful review could lead to consequences 

that we would long regret. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge Congress and the administration to make decisions that 

reflect a commitment to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, 

the principles of a democratic society, and accountable government. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We appreciate the visible stance taken by the President and 

other leaders against discrimination and harassment of Americans 

who are, or are perceived to be, Arab-American or Muslim. We urge 

that policies ensure that individuals will not be targeted solely 

based upon their race, religion, ethnic background, or appearance. 

And we urge President Bush to call for passage of the strengthened 

federal hate crimes legislation that is pending before Congress. 

His embrace of this needed legislation at this critical time would 

ensure its swift enactment into law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People For the American Way's 500,000 members and activists are 

guardians of the Constitution and the democratic values that 

sustain our free society. We believe that we can act both 

expeditiously and wisely, and protect our nation's security while 

remaining true to the values that we hold dear. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us demonstrate the strength of our pluralistic and 

democratic society by safeguarding both the social values and the 

legal principles that sustain it. The world is watching. And so 

are members of People For the American Way and the members of our 

coalition partners. In this time of national crisis, we stand 

together with our fellow Americans in defense of freedom. </font></p>
