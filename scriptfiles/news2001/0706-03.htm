- July 6 - According to a Common Cause analysis of the campaign finance bill sponsored by House Administration Committee Chairman Bob

Ney (R-OH), a single individual would be allowed to contribute

$1,335,000 in hard and soft money in a two-year election cycle.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following below is the text of a Common Cause letter delivered

to Members of the House of Representatives today:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">July 6, 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Dear Representative:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause strongly urges you to oppose H.R. 2360, the Ney campaign finance bill.  The Ney bill fails the test of real reform in multiple ways:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ney bill includes huge increases in the hard money limits.  It would allow one individual to give up to $435,000 in hard money in a two-year election cycle.  (Current law allows a total of $50,000.)  A married couple could give $870,000 in hard money in a single cycle!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ney bill does not ban soft money at the federal level.  Like the bill proposed by Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) last spring and soundly defeated in the Senate, the Ney bill has a &quot;no cap&quot; cap on soft money. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It proposes to limit, rather than ban, soft money by permitting any corporation, labor union or individual to give $150,000 in soft money to each national party committee per two-year election cycle.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since each of the six national party committees (the DNC and RNC, the two Senate campaign committees, and the two House campaign committees) could accept this money, this would allow a single donor - including a corporate or union donor -- to give up to $900,000 in soft money per cycle. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adding together the hard and soft money permitted by the Ney bill, a single individual donor is authorized to give $1,335,000 in a single two-year cycle.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But even this isn't a real limit!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ney bill does not ban soft money at the state level.   The phony &quot;cap&quot; on soft money has no real effect, since donors could give unlimited soft money donations to state party committees.  These state organizations could then use this money to influence federal elections by, for instance, running campaign ads that mention federal candidates, thus perpetuating the status quo of the corrupt soft money system.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ney bill does nothing to stop federal officeholders and candidates from continuing to raise unlimited soft money.  It does nothing to stop the current practice of having federal officials solicit unregulated and unlimited soft money donations in exchange for access and influence.  It leaves the current influence-peddling soft money system in place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ney bill does nothing about the problem of campaign ads masquerading as issue ads.  The Ney bill would not restrict corporations and labor unions from funding these sham ads; it would not even require groups running these sham ads to disclose the real source of the money behind the ads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Ney bill is not reform - it is only a vehicle for sabotaging reform. This proposal would do nothing to get the influence of big money out of our political system.  It doesn't solve the problems of the current system - it simply authorizes the problems to continue.	</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Passing the Ney bill would ensure only that campaign finance legislation would be forced into a House-Senate conference committee, which would produce a very weak bill or, more likely, be the graveyard for reform for this session.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A vote for the Ney bill is a vote to kill reform.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Common Cause urges you to reject the Ney bill and to support the only authentic vehicle for real campaign finance reform, H.R. 2356, the bipartisan Shays-Meehan/McCain-Feingold bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
