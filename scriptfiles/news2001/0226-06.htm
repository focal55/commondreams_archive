Enforce Human Rights Conditions on Military Aid<br>

- February 26 - On the eve of meetings between President Bush and Colombian

President Andres Pastrana in Washington, D.C, outspoken critic of Plan Colombia,

U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), today urged Bush to thoroughly review U.S. 

policy towards Colombia. In a letter released today, Wellstone said his most

pressing concern is the deteriorating human rights situation in Colombia.  He

also pushed for strict Administration enforcement of congressionally-imposed

conditions on last year&#146;s $1.3 billion largely military aid package. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I ask you to urge President Pastrana to take emergency measures to stop the

paramilitary advance, investigate and punish soldiers who work with them, and

ensure that the rule of law is enforced for all Colombians,&#148; Wellstone wrote.

&#147;While President Pastrana has worked to improve the country&#146;s overall human

rights record, the military has yet to break longstanding ties to the

paramilitary groups that are responsible for most human rights violations,

including massacres.  The continuing reports of human rights abuses in Colombia

confirm my grave reservations regarding  our government&#146;s ability to effectively

manage the use of the resources that will be provided while protecting the human

rights of Colombian citizens. &#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the passage of the U.S. assistance package to Colombia, political violence

is dramatically up nationwide. The two major guerilla groups continue to commit

serious violations, including the practice of mass kidnapings. According to a

police estimate, Colombia registered twenty-three massacres by paramilitaries in

the first seventeen days of 2001. With 162 people registered as killed, the toll

for those three weeks was ten people killed every day.  During the debate

surrounding Plan Colombia, the U.S. government and Colombia pledged to work to

reduce the production and supply of cocaine while protecting human rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;To improve the human rights situation in Colombia, I am convinced that the

United States should enforce strict conditions on assistance to Colombia to

ensure that the Colombian Government severs links, at all levels, between the

Colombian military and paramilitary groups,&#148; Wellstone continued.  While the

Clinton Administration first chose to waive most of the conditions last August

and then not to certify at all in January, I urge your administration to enforce

the conditions Congress placed in Plan Colombia.  To do otherwise will

controvert the intent of Congress and signal the worst elements within

Colombia&#146;s military that abuses will go unpunished.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thousands of civilians have fled attacks and threats. As disturbing, in case

after case, Colombian authorities are unwilling or unable to take measures to

protect civilian populations or pursue their attackers. Although villages and

towns often warn of imminent attacks, providing detailed information to the

authorities about the whereabouts of armed groups, attacks are carried out on

schedule and with little or no apparent impediment.  Consistently, the military,

in particular the army, is described as tolerating, supporting, and actively

coordinating paramilitary operations, which often end with atrocities. Most

arrest warrants issued by the Attorney General remained unexecuted. Paramilitary

leaders remain at large and collect warrants like badges of honor. Military

officers with histories of ties to paramilitary groups remain on active duty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;High ranking military officers continue to attack human rights groups, calling

them guerrilla facades or even drug traffickers, in defiance of President

Pastrana&#146;s explicit orders to respect the work of these groups. These attacks

are devastating for the work of groups I am familiar with and admire,&#148; Wellstone

wrote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last December, Wellstone visited Colombia to meet with defenders of human rights

in Bogota and the city of Barrancabermeja, known as the hemisphere&#146;s most

dangerous town.
