- May 16 - Noting that at least 25 

states have already had serious smog problems in 2001, the nonprofit 

Clean Air Trust today warned that the Bush Administration's energy 

policy could worsen air pollution. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Afraid of a political backlash, the administration has tried to 

soften its rhetoric in the past week,&quot; noted Frank O'Donnell, the 

Clean Air Trust's executive director, &quot;but it's important for people 

to examine the policy's fine print, because it could lead to a 

rollback of clean-air protections. It could ultimately mean 

higher-polluting electric power plants and factories, and more toxic 

gasoline.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell added that the White House also appears headed on a 

course that would cause a new gasoline crisis in California -- while 

reducing the state's ability to fight pollution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell noted that the Clean Air Trust has discovered that at 

least 25 states have already experienced levels of pollution greater 

than the public health standards for ozone, or smog this year (See 

attached list of states). Among these is Pennsylvania -- including 

Lancaster, where the President will stage a photo-op Friday to tout 

his energy plan. Eleven additional states have experienced &quot;moderate&quot; 

air pollution problems. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's remarkable that so many states have experienced smog 

problems before the traditional start of the summer smog season,&quot; 

noted O'Donnell. &quot;Literally tens of millions of people have been 

exposed to dirty air. This should be a warning that we need to 

consider the impact on air quality of any new energy strategy. We 

should not retreat from a battle not yet won.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Source Review </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell cited several areas of major concern with the energy 

plan, including a key clean-air enforcement tool known in the jargon 

of the bureaucracy as &quot;new source review.&quot; It is based on a 

relatively simple concept. Today, the Clean Air Act requires major 

new sources of pollution such as refineries or coal-fired electric 

power plants to use the best available pollution control technology. 

Existing pollution sources are treated more leniently. But when 

existing plants make major modernization investments that often cause 

significant increases in pollution, they legally become new sources 

-- and need to upgrade their pollution controls. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This provision of the law is designed to prevent big corporations 

from playing a shell game -- of constantly rebuilding and expanding 

old plants in an effort to avoid modern pollution controls. There is 

clear evidence that some electric power companies, refineries and 

other industries have attempted to evade the law in this way. In 

fact, the EPA and states (led by New York) brought suit against big 

power companies for violating the law. EPA separately brought 

enforcement cases against refineries and pulp and paper mills. As 

recently as last week, EPA reached a legal settlement with a major 

refiner. About half a dozen lawsuits against power companies are 

still pending. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because this enforcement tool has been so effective, electric 

power companies, coal companies and major oil companies such as 

Exxon-Mobil have sought to stop the enforcement, relax the rules, and 

pardon the polluting power plants. Vice President Cheney has 

described this as a &quot;tough call,&quot; and said he will urge EPA to review 

the enforcement program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is unclear at this point if EPA will simply look at weakening 

future enforcement of the Clean Air Act, or whether it will also 

consider dropping the court cases -- and pardoning the polluters. 

(EPA Administrator Christie Whitman has said that she does not favor 

dropping the existing cases.) &quot;In either event, 'review' means delay, 

and delay means more air pollution,&quot; O'Donnell said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One important note on this point: Vice President Cheney and Energy 

Secretary Spencer Abraham have repeatedly noted that new refineries 

have not been built in recent years, and they have implied that 

environmental restrictions were the cause. Not so, says top DOE 

analysts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a May 11 presentation to the National Research Council, DOE 

senior analyst Barry McNutt noted that clean air had not blocked new 

refineries. &quot;It just didn't make sense (economically) to expand 

capacity,&quot; McNutt noted. &quot;Historically it was just a financial 

concern.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">McNutt's view was bolstered in congressional testimony yesterday 

by John Cook, director of the petroleum division of DOE's Energy 

Information Administration. &quot;Markets have been sluggish over the last 

few years,&quot; said Cook. &quot;That is the principal reason for slow 

refining capacity growth.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reformulated Gasoline </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil companies, led by Exxon-Mobil, have also nagged Vice President 

Cheney to &quot;simplify&quot; the current system for distributing 

cleaner-burning or &quot;reformulated&quot; gasoline. In the process, the oil 

companies have grossly distorted the current system in an effort to 

mask their very effective price gouging. (For industry profiteering, 

note the recent FTC report on last summer's gas prices. Although the 

FTC didn't find hard evidence of collusion, it did note &quot;decisions by 

some firms to maximize their profits&quot; by curtailing production and 

keeping available supply off the market.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here are some quick facts: contrary to the industry's claims, 

there are really only three types of reformulated gasoline -- the 

cleanest type, used in California, one that uses the additive MTBE 

(used on the East Coast and in part of Texas) and one that uses 

ethanol as an additive (chiefly in Chicago and Milwaukee). Readers 

should note that it was an industry decision whether to use MTBE or 

ethanol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, several states have adopted fuels that are sort of 

half-steps towards reformulated gasoline. We must point out, however, 

that the oil companies themselves encouraged these &quot;boutique&quot; fuels 

-- which the industry is now denouncing -- rather than agree to make 

reformulated gasoline. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year, the American Petroleum Institute reached an informal 

agreement with the American Lung Association and Northeastern state 

clean-air regulators on a plan that would eliminate the need for 

mandatory use of either MTBE or ethanol. As part of the agreement, 

the oil companies said they would make gasoline that retained the 

clean-air performance of reformulated gas. That plan foundered 

because of opposition from the powerful ethanol lobby. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, the American Petroleum Institute urged Congress to 

eliminate the requirement for MTBE or ethanol, but it did not renew 

its pledge to keep making gasoline as clean as today's reformulated 

gas. If the Bush policy agrees with the oil companies on this, it 

would lead to gasoline that produced more smog and more toxic 

chemical pollution. That would also happen if the administration, as 

rumored, decided to suspend cleaner-gasoline requirements. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is possible to envision a national or regional fuels program 

that simplifies the current distribution system, but those fuels need 

to be clean to avoid increased pollution. They shouldn't be the 

lowest common denominator. The administration could also create new 

pollution problems by preempting state efforts to reduce toxic 

chemical pollution from gasoline. The administration should consult 

with states on this issue and not stick them with unnecessarily 

dirty fuel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Will Bush Cause New Energy Problems in California? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a related issue, the state of California has applied for a 

waiver from the requirement that cleaner-burning gasoline contain 

mandatory levels of MTBE or ethanol. California supplied evidence 

that refiners could make even cleaner gasoline under California rules 

without these additives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EPA agreed with California's assessment (call us if you want 

the EPA proposed ruling on this), but the issue is now at the White 

House. We have heard strong rumors that the White House plans to 

over-rule EPA and reject the California waiver request. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If so, it would lead to gasoline shortages in California starting 

in 2003, according to the California Energy Commission. It would, 

according to EPA, also mean more air pollution in California than if 

the state is allowed a waiver. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would seem the height of hypocrisy if the White House rejects 

the California request,&quot; said O'Donnell, since it would mean bigger 

energy problems and more pollution in California -- the exact 

opposite of what the Administration claims that it seeks.&quot; </font></p>
