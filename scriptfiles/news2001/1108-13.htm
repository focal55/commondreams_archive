<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 8 - Norway's highly-touted 

whale DNA register, claimed as an ironclad means of preventing 

illegally caught whale meat from infiltrating legal markets, has 

failed to produce definitive matches for samples of whale meat sold 

throughout Norway, according to WWF, the conservation organization. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norway's failure to confirm that DNA from whale meat sold inside 

its borders is from legal sources comes as the Norwegian government 

is seeking to re-open international trade in whale products with 

Japan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study released by TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring arm 

of WWF and IUCN, collected 19 samples of whale meat at Norwegian 

markets and provided DNA samples to Norway in a double-blind test 

under agreement with government. Fifteen months after receiving 

the whale DNA samples, the Norwegian government has failed to 

officially confirm any as coming from legal sources. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Norway has given up its claim to a credible DNA system that 

will protect whales,&quot; says WWF Vice President Richard N. Mott. &quot;A 

DNA system that is closed to independent scrutiny will keep the 

public in the dark and give illegal whaling and smugglers a green 

light.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norway, and its whale market partner, Japan, have sought to 

blunt world criticism by claiming that comprehensive DNA registers 

of whales caught under pre-set quotas will allow all whale products 

sold in their markets to be confirmed as coming from a legal catch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the apparent failure of its linchpin system, Norwegian 

authorities continue to insist the DNA register has been audited 

and approved as &quot;fully operational.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF fears that if international trade in whale meat is 

re-opened, the profits from sale to Japan will spur Norway to 

increase its self-set annual quota, possibly doubling the number. 

Norwegian whalers currently kill over 500 Northern minke whales a 

year despite the global moratorium on whaling agreed in the 

International Whaling Commission (IWC). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Trade in whale products is banned under the Convention on 

International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 

(CITES), although Norway and Japan have exempted themselves from 

its requirements. Both countries have repeatedly sought to scale 

back CITES protections for whales but each time their proposals 

have been rejected by the 150-country governing body of the CITES 

treaty. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;WWF calls on Japan and Norway to comply with the letter and 

spirit of the CITES treaty, and not re-open trade in whale meat,&quot; 

said Mott. &quot;Commercial whaling has historically been impossible to 

police, and Norway's DNA system gives no confidence to believe this 

has changed.&quot; </font></p>
