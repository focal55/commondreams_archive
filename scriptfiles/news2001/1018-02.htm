<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - October 18 - What follows is the text 

of a letter signed by 20 religious leaders of various faiths urging 

President Bush to support critical assistance for low-income people 

hurt by the sputtering economy, specifically increased funding for 

Food Stamps and WIC and a raise in the federal minimum wage. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;Speak out for those who cannot speak, for the rights of all the 

destitute. Defend the rights of the poor and needy.&quot;</i> -- Proverbs 

31: 8-9 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">October 18, 2001 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President George W. Bush <br>

The White House <br>

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW <br>

Washington, DC 20500 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. President: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As your Administration negotiates an economic stimulus package, 

we urge you to give the highest priority to the needs of low-income 

people. Specifically we ask you to recommend: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- increased funding for the Food Stamp Program, 

-- increased funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition 

Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and 

-- a two-step, $1.50 increase in the federal minimum wage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As people of faith, we deeply believe that the needs of 

low-income people in this country should come first in any plan to 

revive our country's faltering economy. This is not only morally 

right; it is economically sound. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With our economy sputtering, and layoffs mounting by the tens of 

thousands, the first to feel the effects are those at the bottom of 

the economic ladder. These are the hotel and restaurant workers, 

the airline industry personnel, the sales clerks and factory 

workers, the aides and drivers that are the sinews of our economy. 

They are the hard-working people, who even in a strong economy, 

live paycheck to paycheck. Now they are having to struggle with 

where their next meal will come from, how they will get medical 

help for their sick children, and how they are going to get through 

the winter if they can't pay their utility bills. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For moral reasons, an economic stimulus package must address the 

situation of low-income people. They are the ones who suffer the 

most in times of economic weakness. It is a matter of fairness - 

a core American value. It also makes good economic sense. 

Increasing the minimum wage and strengthening the Food Stamp 

Program and WIC will directly and quickly return money to the 

economy. These programs target low-income people who do not have 

the luxury of saving money at this time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All our faith traditions tell us: God cares deeply for the poor 

and needy. This understanding motivates our religious communities 

and charities to do all they can to reduce poverty and end hunger. 

But we cannot do it alone. Our government must do its part. Even 

today 31 million people in the United States still live in 

households that struggle with hunger. That number will only 

increase in our current economic environment unless those federal 

programs and policies that reduce hunger and poverty are 

sufficiently calibrated and funded to meet the challenge at hand. 

Mr. President, we need your leadership on this important issue. </font></p>
