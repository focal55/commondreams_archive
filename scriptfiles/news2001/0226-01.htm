- February 26 - The new administration of George

W. Bush has made it clear that it will continue the

most inhumane, destructive, and wasteful military

policies of the Clinton years.



<p>An equal danger is that many or most Democrats in

Congress will support these policies, in bipartisan

cooperation -- confirming the criticism from the Green

Party that there's basic agreement and little debate

between the two major parties on many of the most

important issues.



<p>These policies include:



<p>*** Iraq:  Air strikes by the U.S. have continued

regularly against Iraq since December, 1998, as

ordered by President Clinton, and now with the

February 16 raid by ordered President Bush.  But the

bombing assaults, like the sanctions, have failed in

their objective to dislodge the murderous Saddam

Hussein, and have resulted in over a million Iraqi

civilian deaths (180 deaths of children each day,

according to UNICEF).  These deaths are the result of

destroyed infrastructure, withheld food and medicine,

and the bombs themselves.  The U.S., with the lone

support of Great Britain, refuses to consult the Gulf

War Alliance of many other nations on the air strikes,

thus violating international law.



<p>Iraq continues to suffer huge casualties in cancer

(especially leukemia), tumors, and infection, probable

results of the U.S.'s use of radio-active depleted

uranium in shell casings, bullets, and bombs during

the Persian Gulf War.  Thousands of American and other

NATO soldiers have suffered the same effects; Clinton

also allowed the use of depleted uranium in weapons in

assaults against Serbs in Serbia, Kosovo, and Bosnia. 

But the U.S. refuses to take responsibility for the

deadly effects of depleted uranium.  The Pentagon

ignores demands by NATO allies that the U.S. reveal

the chemical and radio-active properties of American

weapons, and refuses to test American soldiers who

were stationed in the Persian Gulf area and the

Balkans.



<p>The Pentagon called the February 16 air strikes

"protective retaliation."  George W. Bush, Secretary

of State Colin Powell, and Secretary of Defense Donald

Rumsfeld have thus added their own Orwellian twist to

the atrocious policies of the Clinton Administration. 

Green Party members will continue to protest and lobby

against the air attacks and sanctions. 



<p>*** Plan Colombia:  The U.S., under Clinton and now

Bush, is sending $1.3 billion in Plan Colombia aid to

fight the War on Drugs.  But thanks to the Colombian

armed force's close ties to right-wing

para-militaries, American taxpayers' money is

implicated in the violent suppression of Colombian

civilians.  In January, 2001, these paramilitaries

were responsible for 27 massacres, leaving at least

200 dead. 



<p>The Clinton-Bush policy of attacking the sources of

Colombian drug exports does nothing to address the

hunger of millions of Americans for cocaine and other

drugs.  Instead, the War on Drugs and Plan Colombia

have (1) threatened to displace up to 100,000

civilians and threaten the human rights and security

of millions of Colombians; (2) caused extensive

environmental destruction, especially from the use of

aerial fumigation -- sprayed chemicals that kill not

just coca but all plant and animal life -- in

Colombia's Amazon basin; and (3) increased guerrilla

warfare and the likelihood of direct U.S. military

involvement.



<p>Greens have strongly opposed and protested Plan

Colombia and the War on Drugs, and have supported the

Colombian people in their democratic vote on October

28, 2000 to reject Plan Colombia. 



<p>*** Anti-ballistic missile defense: In naming Donald

Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense, President Bush in

effect hired a lobbyist for defense industries and for

space-based national missile defense (NMD).  Formerly

called the Strategic Defense Initiative and "Star

Wars," NMD began as a pipe dream of Ronald Reagan,

soon discredited by missile intercept tests (and

tampering of test results).  Bill Clinton revived it

with bipartisan support, the (Donald) Rumsfeld Report,

a 1998 commission study, asserted its urgency in the

defense against "rogue states" like North Korea, and

both George W. Bush and Al Gore campaigned in its

favor in 2000.  President Bush promises rapid

implementation of NMD, and has the bipartisan blessing

of Congress.



<p>The patently fraudulent and failure-prone basis of NMD

-- and the ease by which nuclear and other massively

destructive weapons can be deployed without the use of

missiles -- suggests that the real motivation for NMD

is an enormous boondoggle for defense contractors. 

More testing failures (most recently on July 8, 2000)

and the rapid diffusion of technology, whether from

espionage or "free trade" sales of technological

secrets to other nations (such as China under the

Clinton Adminstration) ensure NMD's continued

uselessness, except as a conduit of taxpayer money to

defense industries.



<p>Even if NMD proved successful, its deployment would

undermine agreements with Russia and other nations to

reduce nuclear weapons.  For that reason, nations

around the world have blasted U.S. efforts to revive

NMD.  Greens have joined this opposition, and Green

candidate Ralph Nader spoke out against it during his

2000 campaign.



<p>The Association of State Green Parties, in its

commitment to nonviolences, stated in its 2000

platform:



<p>"With the end of the Cold War has come a more complex

set of challenges in how our nation defines its

NATIONAL SECURITY. Our present task is to rid

ourselves of the residue of the geopolitical conflict

of East versus West, with its bloated defense budgets,

thousands of unneeded nuclear weapons and major troop

deployments overseas. Greens support sustainable

development and social and economic justice across the

globe. Reducing militarism and reliance on arms

policies is the key to progress toward collective

security."



<p>"We oppose structural and direct violence of all

kinds: assaults against individuals, families, nations

and cultures, the environment and the biosphere.... 

Preventive diplomacy, a strong economy and humane

trade relations are our best defense.  We must

maintain a viable American military force, prudent

foreign policy doctrines, and readiness strategies

that take into account real, not hollow or imagined 

threats to our people, our democratic institutions and

U.S. interests.  Even so, Greens seek strength through

peace."
