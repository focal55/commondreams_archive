- June 14 - Michael D. Barnes, President of Handgun Control and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, announced that, starting today, the organizations will be known as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In adopting the new names, we honor Jim and Sarah Brady's personal courage and their extraordinary commitment to reducing gun violence in America,&quot; said Barnes. &quot;Against tremendous odds and with endless tenacity, Jim and Sarah have worked and succeeded in building a bipartisan movement focused on strengthening our country's gun laws. From public service to public safety, their life's work has made a difference for the common good.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are changing the name to honor the Bradys and better express our mission. We are also sending an unmistakable message that we will not rest until we end the terrible toll of gun violence in this country. Our name is new, but our work remains the same: to enact and enforce common-sense gun legislation; to provide public education about gun violence, and to reform the gun industry.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The official unveiling of the new names and logos will take place at a National Tribute to Jim and Sarah Brady tonight in Washington, D.C. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>New Poll Confirms Public Support for Common-Sense Gun Control Measures</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Also today, the Brady Campaign released a new national poll conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation International showing that Americans overwhelmingly support responsible gun control measures. Significantly, the poll reflects solid support for both common-sense gun control laws and enforcement programs, even among those who voted for George W. Bush for President. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, respondents were asked whether the Bush Administration's new plan to combat gun violence through strict enforcement of current gun laws should have also sought to strengthen current gun laws by requiring additional measures. 86 percent of all respondents -- and 82 percent of those who voted for Bush -- agreed that the Administration's proposal should have also required background checks for every gun sale. 87 percent agreed that gun dealers should be required to wait until background checks are completed before allowing buyers to take possession of a new gun. And 82 percent believe that all handgun owners should be licensed after passing a basic gun safety test. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again, American citizens demonstrated that they agree with us - strong enforcement programs should be augmented by preventative measures,&quot; said Sarah Brady, Chair of the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. &quot;President Bush should listen to them on this issue, and we will work to make sure that their voices are heard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other poll highlights included strong support for the Brady Campaign's legislative agenda:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">83 percent of the respondents support closing the &quot;gun show loophole&quot; by requiring criminal background checks on all gun purchases at such shows. In addition, 79 percent of the respondents support preventing gun dealers from selling guns to anyone who has not passed a background checks, even if it takes more than three days to complete the records check.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">84 percent of the respondents believe in requiring that all guns be sold with childproof safety locks.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">73 percent of the respondents believe that a law should be passed that would prevent individuals from buying more than one handgun a month.</font></li>

</ul>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>As the nation's largest national, non-partisan, grassroots organizations leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence are dedicated to creating an America free from gun violence, where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in their communities.</i></font></p>
