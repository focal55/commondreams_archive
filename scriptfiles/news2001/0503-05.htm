- May 3 - Vice President Dick Cheney is a dinosaur living in the age of

mammals. Imagine a public official uttering the following:

<p>"Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is

not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy.

<p>We ... safeguard the environment by making greater use of

the cleanest methods of power generation we know.... that is

nuclear power.

<p>The notion that somehow developing the resources in ANWR

(Arctic National Wildlife Reserve) requires a vast despoiling of

the environment is provably false."

<p>It is time for the American people to insist Mr. Cheney stop

talking nonsense and to tell Mr. Cheney and his fellow "oil man"

President Bush that they have to wean themselves from the

economically and environmentally costly energy policies that

keep taxpayers, consumers and environmentalists hooked on oil

coal and nuclear power.

<p>Federal policy over the past century has largely failed to

promote an energy system based on safe, secure, economically

affordable, and environmentally benign energy sources. The tax

code, budget appropriations, and regulatory processes

overwhelmingly have been used to subsidize dependence on fossil

fuels and nuclear power. The result: increased sickness and

premature deaths, depleted family budgets, acid rain destruction

of lakes, forests, and crops, oil spill contamination, polluted

rivers and loss of aquatic species and the long-term peril of

climate change and radioactive waste dumps-not to mention a

dependency on external energy supplies.

<p>There is an alternative. Three decades of detailed

assessments, on-the-ground results, and research and development

innovations in the energy-consuming devices used in our

buildings, vehicles and industries undeniably show that energy

efficiency and renewable energy technologies are superior energy

options for society. They offer a present and future path that

is economically attractive, safe and secure from large-scale or

long-term risks or threats to public health, future generations,

and the environment.

<p>But embarking on that path requires overcoming the power of

the oil, nuclear and other conventional fuel industries to which

both the Republicans and Democrats are indentured. Under the

thumb of the dirty fuel industries, Congress and the Executive

branch have refused to adopt even the most modest, common sense

measures. For example, when the President's Committee of

Advisors on Science and Technology concluded in a 1997 report

that doubling the Department of Energy's efficiency R&amp;D funding

would produce a 40 to 1 return on the investment for the nation,

Congress responded by proposing deep cuts in the efficiency and

renewables R&amp;D budgets.

<p>The Clinton/Gore Administration nod to increased energy

efficiency relied largely on corporate welfare. Rather than push

for an increase in auto fuel-efficiency standards, the

Administration established the Partnership for a New Generation

of Vehicles (PNGV). PNGV is a $1.5 billion subsidy program for

the Big Three auto companies that has done nothing to improve

auto fuel efficiency but has served as a convenient smokescreen

behind which the industry has been able to fend off new

regulatory requirements for more efficient cars.

<p>Energy Innovations: A Prosperous Path to a Clean Environment,

a joint study prepared by half a dozen of the nation's prominent

energy and environmental research and advocacy groups, shows

that a handful of simple and straightforward measures could

produce a significant reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2)

emissions (prime cause of acid rain) by 2010, compared to 1990

levels and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (a key precursor of

ground-level ozone, smog) as well as deep cuts in emissions of

other damaging pollutants, including fine particles, toxic

metals like mercury and hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide (CO2)

emissions.

<p>President Bush could establish the United States as the model

for other countries by adopting a sustainable energy policy that

includes:

<p>-- ending fossil fuel and nuclear corporate welfare supports,

including numerous special tax preferences;

<p>-- launching a robust federal research and development

program in sustainable renewable energy sources, so that the

energy-independence promises of wind, solar and other forms of

renewable energy are finally realized;

<p>-- increasing auto fuel efficiency standards (at least to 45

miles per gallon for cars and 35 miles per gallon for light

trucks, to be phased in over five years) during a transition

period to zero-emissions cars;

<p>-- adopting stronger efficiency standards for appliances and

mandatory energy performance building codes;

<p>-- ensuring electricity policies which promote efficient use

of electricity through a range of measures including "net

metering"-requirements that companies pay market prices for

electricity generated by consumers and passed back to the

utility-and elimination of clean air exemptions for

"grandfathered" fossil fuel facilities; and

<p>-- establishing a well-funded employee transition assistance

fund and job-retraining program for displaced coal miners-easily

affordable with the savings from greater energy efficiency.

<p>Our country has more problems than it deserves and more

solutions than it uses. It is time for the United States to stop

letting Exxon-Mobil, Peabody Coal and Westinghouse shape our

energy policy and for our misguided elected officials to adopt

an energy strategy based on clean renewable energy and

conservation. Future generations will thank us for curbing our

fossil fuel appetite.
