- August 30 - A new study, PAYCHECK

TO PAYCHECK: WORKING FAMILIES AND THE COST OF HOUSING IN

AMERICA, released by the National Housing Conference (NHC),

finds that 3.7 million families who work the equivalent of a

full-time job are experiencing a critical housing need. That is,

these families spend more than 50 percent of their income for

housing and/or live in severely substandard conditions.

Moreover, this figure represents a worsening situation for low-

to moderate-income American working families. Between 1997 and

1999 -- the most recent nationwide data available -- the overall

number of these families with critical housing needs rose by

almost 700,000 -- a 23 percent increase in just two years. The

primary culprit is the rising cost of housing, affecting 16

percent more homeowners and an astounding 38 percent more

renters as compared to two years ago.

<p>The study further documents that having a job does not

guarantee a family a decent place to live at an affordable cost.

An analysis of five vital occupations -- police officer,

elementary school teacher, licensed practical nurse, janitor and

retail salesperson -- was carried out for each of the nation's

60 largest housing markets. The analysis indicates that when it

comes to homeownership, households dependent on a teacher's or

police officer's salary alone cannot afford to buy a

median-priced home in more than half and in more than

three-quarters of the 60 metropolitan areas, respectively.

Licensed practical nurses are priced out of all but two markets.

On the rental housing side, janitors are able to afford to rent

a one-bedroom apartment on 30 percent of their income (the

standard measure of affordability) in just six metropolitan

areas, and retail salespersons are able to do so in just three

of the 60 housing markets. Neither occupation can afford to rent

a two-bedroom apartment in any of the 60 metropolitan areas

included in the study.

<p>NHC President J. Michael Pitchford indicates that, "in some

parts of the country, where economic growth has been the

strongest, the labor force critical to sustaining the economy

either cannot find housing that is reasonably priced or cannot

locate within an appropriate commuting distance of their jobs."

Pitchford, a senior vice president with Bank of America points

to the fact that the percentage of moderate-income (full-time)

working families with critical housing needs has increased from

23 percent to 28.5 percent, growing in number from 3.0 million

to 3.7 million. According to Helen Kanovsky, executive vice

president of the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust, far too many

working families are forced to make difficult, if not impossible

life choices in order to buy or rent safe, decent housing. "No

one should be put in the position of having to work two or three

jobs to find or remain in suitable housing, and working families

should not be forced to make choices among food, child care and

health coverage to be able to buy or rent an affordable place to

live."

<p>The study, part of a series of reports focusing on the

housing needs of working families, draws on data from the 1997

and 1999 American Housing Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census

Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Occupational data were gathered from the U.S. Department of

Labor's 1999 Occupational Earnings Survey.
