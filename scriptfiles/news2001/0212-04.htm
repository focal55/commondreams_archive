- February 12 - Calling the New York State

and City decision to grant a series of subsidies, now expected to

total more than $1 billion, to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

"one of the most foolish and cruelly ironic urban public policy

decisions in recent memory," consumer advocate Ralph Nader in a

letter today urged New York Governor George Pataki and New York City

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to pull the plug on the deal.

<p>"Tragi-comedy may play well on Broadway, but it doesn't belong on

Wall Street, at least not with City Hall and Albany as the

underwriters," Nader wrote.

<p>In December, the city entered into a letter of intent to assist

the NYSE in constructing a new trading floor. The arrangement commits

the city to acquire a land for the new exchange, and for the city and

state to construct a new trading floor for the NYSE, and to grant tax

and subsidized energy benefits to the NYSE. In exchange, the

taxpayers receive nothing but $10 million annual rent, which will

never come close to reimbursing the city and state for their costs.

<p>"The sole purported rationale for the corporate welfare bonanza,

of course, is to retain the New York Stock Exchange in New York

City," Nader noted. "If one were to credit this rationale, the gift

of more than a billion dollars for the purpose of retaining fewer

than 5,000 jobs -- while not even ostensibly creating new ones --

would, even by the corrupt standards of job-retention blackmail

deals, set a highwater mark for ransom payments among arrangements

of

this scale."

<p>However, Nader argued, there is no chance that the stock exchange

would leave New York City.

<p>"The New Jersey ploy is nothing more than a NYSE ruse to provide a

pretext for covering public officials using what Justice Louis

Brandeis once called 'other people's money," Nader wrote.

<p>"Surely some residual sense of shame must persist in New York

politics," Nader wrote. "In a state with one of the nation's worst

child poverty rates, and one of the largest gaps between rich and

poor, is a billion dollar subsidy for the emblematic bastion of

global capitalism not beyond the pale?"
