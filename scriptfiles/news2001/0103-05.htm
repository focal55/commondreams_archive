- January 3 -  Commercial Alert, child advocates and public health organizations sent a

letter today to National Association of Attorneys General President

Andrew Ketterer, Attorney General of Maine, requesting an investigation

of whether Philip Morris Cos. is luring children to smoking by

distributing millions of textbook covers bearing the Philip Morris

name.  The letter follows.



<p>Dear Attorney General Ketterer:



<p>We write to request that the National Association of Attorneys General

investigate whether Philip Morris Cos. is marketing tobacco products to

children directly or indirectly, in violation of the 1998 Master

Settlement Agreement between certain tobacco companies and state

officials, by distributing free Philip Morris textbook covers to

millions of schoolchildren.



<p>According to news accounts, Primedia's Cover Concepts has sent out 13-15

million of the Philip Morris book covers, and intends to distribute 13

million more.(1)  The Philip Morris book jackets are ostensibly a part

of an anti-smoking educational campaign.  However, Advertising Age notes

that one textbook cover's design "looks alarmingly like a colorful pack

of cigarettes."(2)  More importantly, the textbook covers promote to

children the Philip Morris brand name, which is synonymous with tobacco

and smoking.



<p>Branded book jackets are an effective way to increase brand recognition

among schoolchildren.  According to Advertising Age, one market research

study found that schoolchildren had an extremely high brand recall of up

to 74% for brands promoted on book covers distributed by Cover

Concepts.(3)  When Philip Morris promotes its name among children, it

increases its brand recognition, and builds a relationship with them

that can help sell tobacco products.  This is especially troubling given

that Marlboro, a Philip Morris brand, is the #1 brand of cigarettes

among children.



<p>At a minimum, by promoting its brand name among schoolchildren, Philip

Morris appears to be indirectly promoting tobacco products to them,

which violates the Master Settlement Agreement's broad prohibition

against marketing tobacco to children:

		

<p>No Participating Manufacturer may take any action, directly or

indirectly, to target Youth within any Settling State in the

advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, or take any

action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain or increase

the incidence of Youth smoking within any Settling State.



<p>Some educators are rightly worried about whether these Philip Morris

book covers will encourage children to use tobacco products.  For

example, on November 27, Delaine Eastin, California State Superintendent

of Public Instruction, encouraged California county and district

superintendents to "thwart this attempt by the Philip Morris Tobacco

Company to reach kids with their message."(4)



<p>We strongly urge you to determine whether the distribution Philip Morris

textbook covers to schoolchildren is a direct or indirect promotion of

tobacco products in violation of the Master Settlement Agreement.  If

so, we urge you to take appropriate action to recall the Philip Morris

textbook covers, halt any additional dissemination of these covers, and

to take whatever other measures are needed to safeguard the health of

schoolchildren from marketing depredations of Philip Morris.
