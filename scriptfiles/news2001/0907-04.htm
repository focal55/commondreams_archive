years, the number of minority applicants to medical schools has 

increased, according to a study in the Journal of the American 

Medical Association. 4266 students from underrepresented minority 

groups (black, Native American, Mexican American and Mainland Puerto 

Rican) applied to the entering class in 2000, an increase of 2 

percent from 1999 figures. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After watching this troubling trend over the past five years, we 

are heartened to see even this slight increase,&quot; said Jaya Agrawal, 

national president of the American Medical Student Association 

(AMSA), the nation's largest, independent medical student 

organization. Agrawal is a fourth-year medical student at Brown 

University. Studies indicate that minority physicians are 40 percent 

or more likely to practice in underserved communities, according to 

Agrawal. &quot;Unfortunately, too many of these communities are already 

woefully underserved by physicians, getting their care in hospitals 

and clinics that are severely under-funded and under-staffed, and too 

often go without the latest in technology,&quot; Agrawal continued. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though the reasons for the increase are not clearly defined by the 

study, AMSA (www.amsa.org) congratulates the nation's medical schools 

on their efforts, and especially applauds the efforts of local youth 

'pipeline' programs that work to interest young underrepresented 

minority students in the health sciences and medicine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA, however, remains concerned that academic medicine might lose 

even this modest momentum in light of a wavering national commitment 

to affirmative action and the diminishing support of student aid 

targeted at those with exceptional financial needs. Especially 

troubling are recent reports about the decline in federal support for 

the National Health Service Corps and its loan repayment program, 

designed to support students who have an interest in practicing in 

underserved areas. These proven successful programs fill a vital need 

that serves many thousands of Americans every day and continuing and 

expanding these services can only serve to combat health care access 

and disparity issues nationwide. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA calls on all the stakeholders-medical schools, minority 

communities, along with state and federal agencies-to make a 

concerted national effort to plan and coordinate a full-court press 

on this issue. &quot;We must work together on many fronts toward our 

common vision of equal and fair health care for all,&quot; concluded 

Agrawal. </font></p>
