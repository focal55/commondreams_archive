<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BALTIMORE 

- February 2 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>WHO: </b>On Dec. 19, 1999, Philip Berrigan and Susan Crane of

Baltimore's Jonah House, the Rev. Stephen Kelly, SJ, and

Elizabeth Walz, a Catholic Worker from Philadelphia,

calling themselves the Plowshares Vs. Depleted Uranium,

disarmed two A-10 Warthog [Fairchild Thunderbolt II]

aircraft at Warfield

Air National Guard Base in Middle River, Maryland. The

activists hammered on the A-10s, because the plane has a

Gatling gun which fires 3,900 rounds of depleted uranium

per minute and was used against Iraq and Yugoslavia. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After being denied the opportunity to present a defense at

their trial, the Plowshares were convicted by a jury in

Towson, Maryland and sentenced to prison by Baltimore

County Circuit Court Judge James T. Smith, Jr.   While Rev.

Kelly remains in solitary confinement in Hagerstown,

Maryland, the

other three Plowshares were released from prison: Elizabeth

Walz on Dec. 6, 2000; Susan Crane on Jan. 3, 2001; and

Philip Berrigan on Jan. 12, 2001.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHAT:</b> Berrigan, Crane and Rev. Kelly were members of the

Prince of Peace Plowshares, which disarmed an Aegis

destroyer at the Bath [Maine] Iron Works on February 12,

1997.  They were sentenced to federal prison for this

disarmament and placed on probation upon release.  While on

federal probation, the three were arrested with Walz at the

National Guard base in Middle River.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Accused of violating probation, Crane, first, and then

Berrigan, appeared before Judge Gene Carter in federal

court in Portland, Maine.  Judge Carter sentenced the

Plowshares activists to one year in prison for violating

probation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHEN:</b>  Friday, February 2, 2001-- Susan Crane's probation

violation hearing at 11 AM, Philip Berrigan's probation

violation hearing at 1:30 PM</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHERE:</b> federal courthouse in Portland, Maine

                         

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHY:</b> The religious activists were moved to resistance

because of their grave concern that the nuclear threat

still exists.  Additionally, they became aware of the

deadly environmental damage  caused by the use of depleted

uranium in Iraq and Yugoslavia.  So they disarmed an Aegis

destroyer, suffered the consequences, and later hammered on

A-10s, while on federal probation.  Judge Carter, instead

of making a statement against nuclear warmaking, chose to

send the peace activists back to prison.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Solidarity demonstrations took place in Portland, Maine,

when supporters marched from the Bath Iron Works to the

federal courthouse, and outside the Warfield Air National

Guard Base in Middle River, where protesters held signs

condemning depleted uranium.  While the two resisters were

jailed, the resistance will continue.  </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">                   #############</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The revocation hearings were an opportunity to respond to

charges of committing a crime, associating with felons and

not paying restitution.  After being found guilty, each

defendant was turned over to U.S. marshals.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Susan and Phil, in addressing the court, tried to make the

point that the real criminal activity occurs when the

government engages in warmaking. They highlighted, for

example, the invidious use of depleted uranium.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sister Ardeth Platte, who observed the hearings, reported

that Susan Crane asked the judge how he could justify his

position and not uphold the Constitution and the treaties

under international law.  His response, that he did not

accept the Plowshares' perspectives, brought a collective

gasp from the courtroom supporters.</font></p>
