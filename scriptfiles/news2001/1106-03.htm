<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON -  

 November 6 - On the anniversary of the protracted fight over the

2000 presidential election, a new state-by-state report

from the Common Cause Education Fund finds only a handful

of states have made any improvement in their election

laws, and that one state even made its problems worse.

Most states have failed to act at all, according to Not

Making The Grade, the 2001 election reform report card

released today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By looking at what's happened in state legislatures in

the past year, you'd never know that we had a genuine

electoral crisis on our hands just a year ago,&quot; Common

Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.  &quot;Even with all

the commission reports, academic studies, and

investigative journalism on our electoral shortcomings,

states have not responded with the kind of urgency that

the problems demand.  Many are simply waiting in vain

for financial help to arrive from Washington without

doing anything to pave the way.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In issuing letter grades, the Common Cause report

examined whether states have statewide voter

registration systems, systems to allow provisional

balloting, policies to reenfranchise ex-felons whose

sentences have been completed, and a low rate of

residual (or uncounted) votes.  Common Cause provides

a current grade for each state, as well as a grade

for each state's election laws as of election day

last year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Florida made some of the most dramatic election

reform progress by creating a statewide voter

registration system and banning notoriously faulty

voting machines - only enough progress, though, to

bring their grade from an &quot;F&quot; to a &quot;C&quot;, according

to the report.  Florida would need to amend the

state's constitution in order to restore voting

rights to ex-felons who have completed their

sentences, and Florida has the highest rate of

that kind of disenfranchisement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indiana made the biggest jump, from an &quot;F&quot; to a &quot;B&quot;,

by creating a real-time, online statewide voter

registration system that county election officials

have access to via the Internet, and by banning

faulty machines and providing $4 million for machinery

upgrades.  Indiana also restores voting rights to

citizens who have committed felonies upon their release

from prison or jail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The point of this report isn't just to criticize, the

point is to make the case for action,&quot; Harshbarger said.

&quot;We only look at four major election reform criteria,

but even the states who have made progress in these

areas still may need improvements in other areas,

including absentee balloting, the length and

convenience of polling hours, and training for poll

workers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's not enough just to put the punch-cards out to

pasture and hope we don't repeat the Florida fiasco.

We need to take bold steps to ensure that all Americans

have the fullest confidence that if they cast a vote,

it will indeed count.  The right to vote is perhaps

the most elemental of all civil rights, one that goes

to the heart of what it means to be an American citizen.

States and Congress have a long way to go.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In August, Common Cause created an Election Reform Task

Force comprised of leading election experts to help guide

the organization's efforts on this issue and to mobilize

local and national grassroots and lobbying activities

around election reform.</font></p>
