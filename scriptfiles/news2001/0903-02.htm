- September 3 -  Greenpeace today accused the world's governments of failing to fulfill their commitment to reduce world hunger <a href="#one">(1)</a> while ignoring the methods of agriculture that are environmentally sound and proven.  The organization claimed that nutritious, high-yielding and often naturally pest-controlled crops are already being produced, but that the commercial power and political influence of the genetic engineering (GE) industry is preventing proper investment in these preferred solutions.    

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study commissioned by Greenpeace and a development organization, Bread for the World, found 208 examples of sustainable agricultural projects at work in 52 developing countries <a href="#two">(2)</a>. This study was presented on the eve of an international conference "Sustainable Food Security for All by 2020" organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) this week in Bonn <a href="#three">(3)</a>. The projects in the study show how hunger and poverty can be overcome by sustainable agriculture without genetic engineering threatening biodiversity, eroding the soil base,  polluting water or endangering human health.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Rather than supporting existing environmentally friendly practices, governments are acting as if they have delegated their responsibility to feed the world to the GE industry, which is full of  'pie in the sky' ideas and gives no credit to what is literally already on the ground. The real solutions are out there, but desperately lack funding and promotion, because it is in the GE industry's interest to keep it that way. If the level of investment that we see for GE today was made available to proven sustainable methods of production and researching alternatives, it would go a long way to address problems of agriculture in developing countries," said Lorenz Petersen, Genetic Engineering Campaigner for Greenpeace.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace called on world governments to take their commitment to achieve food security for all seriously and reverse the current trend of declining assistance to developing countries <a href="#four">(4)</a>. The organization demanded independent public research and promotion of sustainable agricultural models - especially those looking at the needs of small-scale farmers who will suffer the most if the sellout to GE industry continues.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Sustainable agriculture is not a luxury but a necessity and it provides the most effective means to combat hunger. We should solve problems, not create new ones. Genetic engineering puts people and their environment at further risk in countries that do not have the capacity to deal with the problems that it may bring,"  Petersen added.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="three">(3)</a> The international conference on "Sustainable Food Security for All by 2020", organized by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in close collaboration with the German government and several other organizations from civil society and the private and public sectors takes place in Bonn on September 4- 6, 2001. The conference will address the emerging concerns of how to fulfill the goal declared by the World Food Summit in 1996.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="four">(4)</a> Official Development Assistance has decreased during the 1990s from 0.33% to 0.25% of the Gross National Product of OECD Countries, to the detriment of the majority of the developing countries, especially the least developed countries in Africa which receive almost no private inflows.
