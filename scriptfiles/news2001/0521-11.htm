- May 21 -  The D.C. Statehood Green Party

endorsed a strong statement of support for the

"Charleston 5," dockworkers and members of the

International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), who

face spurious charges of "rioting" after the state of

South Carolina ordered a police assault against a

legitimate union protest in Charleston.



<p>The statement of support is appended below.  The D.C.

Statehood Green Party, which is a member of the

Association of State Green Parties, issues the

statement in response to a call to action by the ILA

and the Black Radical Congress (BRC).





<p>BACKGROUND



<p>The Charleston 5 are members of the ILA Locals 1422,

which is 99% African American, and 1771 who face

charges of felony assault and imprisonment for up to

five years, after the state of South Carolina

unleashed a military-style police assault on

dockworkers picketing to oppose scab labor in

Charleston.



<p>Nordana Lines, a shipping company, announced on

October 1, 1999 that it would convert to non-union

labor on ships in Charleston, after 23 years of using

ILA workers. The union responded with picket lines.

The state sent about 600 riot-equipped police in

armored vehicles, on horseback, and in helicopters and

patrol boats, and commenced a violent assault on the

picketers.   Five workers now face charges of

"inciting to riot" and are under house arrest.



<p>According to Frances M. Beal of BRC, "In the case of

these dockworkers, the State of South Carolina is

going even further to rein in black political power.

There is state legislation pending to inhibit the

right of unions to collect dues from their members,

and separate legislation to prohibit any union member

from being appointed to any board, agency or

commission in the state of South Carolina.... 'The

Attorney General is planning to run for governor next

time around and he's trying to make a name for

himself,' said South Carolina AFL-CIO President Donna

Dewitt. 'I think he plans to make himself a name at

the expense of these five guys.'" ("Black Labor Rights

on Trial in South Carolina," Black Radical Chronicles,

Volume 1, Issue 1, April 23, 2001)



<p>The police assault displayed military tactics, in

which urban police forces were trained beginning in

the mid-90s on order from President Clinton.  The same

military tactics have been used by police to suppress

civilian dissent in Seattle in 1999 at the WTO

protests, in 2000 in Washington, DC at the World

Bank/IMF protests, and in Philadelphia and Los Angeles

during the Republican and Democratic Party

conventions.



<p>Nordana Lines later negotiated an agreement with ILA,

but WSI, the company that hired the nonunion workers,

has continued its lawsuit against the two union locals

and their presidents. 



<p>Initially, according to BRC, "the police arrested

eight longshore workers on charges of misdemeanor

trespassing. At this point State Attorney General

Charlie Condon rushed in, took the case away from

local law enforcement officials, and raised the

misdemeanor charges to felony rioting charges. At a

preliminary hearing a judge dismissed the felony

charges for lack of evidence, but Condon then went to

the Grand Jury and sought and obtained indictments

against five of the defendants, on the same charges

that had just been dismissed." 



<p>BRC has also documented how state officials used the

assault against the dockworkers' union to suppress

political participation by black working people,

quoting Ken Riley, president of Local 1422: "These

longshore jobs are the only jobs in South Carolina

where a black can really move up from below poverty to

a middle class standard of living in a short time if

he comes out and applies himself....  Our problems

began when we started getting involved in state

politics."  The incident took place about the same

time as 47,000 people rallied in demand that the

Confederate flag be removed from the state capitol. 



<p>Mr. Riley himself had been nominated to the State

Ports Authority, but the South Carolina Manufacturing

Alliance and the state Chamber of Commerce reacted by

pressing the governor into withdrawing his name. BRC

notes that "Republican state legislators then

introduced a bill -- dubbed the Kenneth Riley Bill --

prohibiting union members from serving on state boards

and commissions.  Its proponents touted it as a way to

reduce union influence in state politics -- in a state

where only 3.8 percent of the workers are in unions.

The bill passed the House, but was killed in the state

Senate." 





<p>STATEMENT OF SUPPORT



<p>"The D.C. Statehood Green Party supports the

International Longshoremen's Association (ILA),

AFL-CIO, and the Black Radical Congress (BRC) in

demanding dismissal of charges leveled against the

Charleston 5, dockworkers who face felony charges for

"rioting" in the wake of a military-style police

assault ordered by the state of South Carolina to

break up a union protest against union-busting and the

use of scab labor in the Charleston shipping industry.

 



<p>"We demand that the suit brought by Winyah Stevedoring

Inc. (WSI), the company that hired the nonunion

workers, against the two union locals and their

presidents be dropped or dismissed.  



<p>"We demand that the state of South Carolina not

support plans by WSI, Nordana, or any other company to

break the power of the ILA or any other union, and

that it cease using police power to suppress union

protest. 



<p>"We support the right of workers to organize and

bargain with employers, to protest peacefully against

unfair practices, full rights to political

participation, and the right to a decent standard of

living for African Americans, for other people of

color, and for all working people and poor people in

South Carolina and throughout the U.S.



<p>"We endorse the announced march on Columbia, the

capital of South Carolina, on June 9 to demand that

the state drop the criminal charges against the

Charleston 5 and that WSI drop the civil lawsuit

against both locals and their members, and we endorse

the call by the International Longshore and Warehouse

Union for a day of solidarity with the Charleston 5."



<p>Checks in support of the Charleston 5 should be made

out to the "Dockworkers Defense Fund" and sent to:

Campaign for Workers' Rights in South Carolina, P.O.

Box 21777, Charleston, SC 29413. or to Dockworkers

Defense Fund, 910 Morrison Drive, Charleston, SC

29403, Attn: Robert J. Ford.)
