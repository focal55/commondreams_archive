<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 3 - In the aftermath of the 11 September attacks in the United

States, the shock and outrage at the appalling loss of life must

not be used to justify measures which might lead to further human

rights abuses, Amnesty International warned today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In a report released today, Amnesty International

documents evidence of a backlash against Muslims and people of

Middle Eastern or Asian origin or appearance in at least 10

countries. The report also highlights the first worrying

indications that the &quot;fight against terrorism&quot; may be

opportunistically used to clamp down on civil liberties and human

rights.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The horror of the attacks on September 11 should not

result in other communities around the world being victimised in

the name of 'fighting terrorism,'&quot; Amnesty International said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In Europe and elsewhere, governments are rushing to the

top of their political agendas laws that threaten to curb civil

liberties and possibly reduce safeguards against abuses of human

rights. Measures to clamp down on illegal immigrants, which

threaten to undermine the rights of asylum seekers, are being

debated in a number of countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In what appears to be a spate of racial hate crimes

directly linked to the attacks on New York and Washington, men

and women of all ages have suffered abuse and even serious

attacks in streets, schools and workplaces just because of their

-- real or perceived -- religious or national identity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Despite positive calls for tolerance and restraint by the

authorities, in the USA alone, more than 540 attacks on

Arab-Americans and at least 200 on Sikhs have been reported in

the week following the attacks. Mosques, Hindu temples and

community centres have been attacked and vandalized in countries

as diverse as Poland, India, the United Kingdom and Denmark.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In a number of countries, including Peru and Paraguay,

Muslim people and people of Middle Eastern origin have been

detained on suspicion of links with &quot;terrorist&quot; organizations,

amid fears that they may be victims of arbitrary detention and

ill-treatment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Amnesty International fears that many people in

Afghanistan will be at heightened risk of suffering human rights

abuses, noting that non-pushtuns living in Taleban-controlled

areas are particularly vulnerable as they may be viewed

mistakenly as sympathetic to the Northern Alliance.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is a sad irony that, only weeks after the United

Nations World Conference on Racism, many communities around the

world are facing increased discrimination and racist abuse,&quot;

Amnesty International said.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is also a danger that, while the attention of the

world is focussed elsewhere, governments will increase their

repression of opponents,&quot; Amnesty International warned. &quot;While

the world is looking the other way, abuse and repression can be

carried out without fear of rebuke,&quot; the organization added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     When over a dozen Palestinians, including a 14-year-old

girl, were killed by Israeli security forces in the 2 days

following the attacks, getting hardly any attention by the

international media, the Israeli Defence Minister Benjamin Ben

Eliezar said in a press interview: &quot;It is a fact that we have

killed 14 Palestinians [...] with the world remaining absolutely

silent. It's a disaster for Arafat&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Official statements in China have given rise to fears

that the authorities might use the events on 11 September to

further increase their harsh repression of Muslim ethnic groups

accused of being &quot;separatists&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot; or &quot;religious

extremists, in the Xinjian Uighur Autonomous Region in the north

west of the country. Similarly, there is concern that the Uzbek

government may use the current climate as an opportunity to clamp

down on any manifestation of perceived Islamic opposition with

greater impunity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In the face of these disquieting trends, Amnesty

International is urging all governments to step up measures to

ensure that the rights of all, whether citizens or not, are

equally protected and to send a clear message that racist

violence and threats will not be tolerated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular, the organization is calling on governments to

ensure that:<br>

- the rights of all people are respected in the response to the

attacks of  11 September;<br>

- any new legislation passed in response to the attacks of 11

September contains provisions to respect human rights;<br>

     - the rights of asylum seekers are protected;<br>

     - all asylum-seekers have access to a fair and

satisfactory asylum determination process;<br>

     - no one is returned to a country where they face serious

human rights violations; and<br>

     - hate crimes are denounced and those responsible for

them are brought to justice.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While Amnesty International recognizes the right -- and

indeed the duty -- of all governments to take measures to protect

their citizens, it is essential that these measures do not lead

to violations of human rights,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font></p>
