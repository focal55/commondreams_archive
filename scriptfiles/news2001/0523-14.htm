<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 23 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) today voted against the Republican tax cut bill (H.R. 1836) following four days of vigorous opposition

on the Senate floor.   Wellstone, who supports balanced tax relief, said the

$1.35 trillion 11-year GOP tax cut is fiscally irresponsible, will eliminate the

possibility for future investments in national priorities, and fails the basic

test of fairness.  He especially warned that the measure opens the door to the

return of Reagan-era deficits.  </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;I believe in tax cuts that reward work, not wealth.  Today the Senate went in

the opposite direction with this bill.  Fully one-third of the benefits of this

tax cut will go to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, while only 16

percent of the benefits go to those making $44,000 or less, or 60% of the

American people.  Where is the fairness in that kind of distribution?  These are

Robin Hood-in-reverse tax cuts,&#148; Wellstone said.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans who earn between $27,000 and $44,000 will get an average tax cut of

merely $596.  The wealthiest Americans, with an average income of over $900,000, will see an average cut of $44,536.  Ten million children (1 in 7 children) live

in families that will see no benefit from the legislation because the parents do

not earn enough income to qualify for the tax cuts in the bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I remember well the era of deficits.  In my ten years in the Senate, something

I have learned is that, as a nation, we do not want to return to the era of

fiscally irresponsible deficit spending.  We know how hard it is to bring them

down once deficits are in place.  In the outyears, as millions of Baby Boomers

prepare to retire, I fear that this tax cut will decimate funding for the

Medicare and Social Security on which they will depend,&#148; said Wellstone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;During debate on this bill, I vocally supported numerous amendments that

promised significant tax cuts for working Americans.  All were defeated by the

Republican majority, sadly, which instead drove through a tax cut lacking in all

proportion and balance.  The real price to the country of this tax cut, which

overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest, is not the $1.35 trillion as advertised.

Rather, when fixes to the Alternate Minimum Tax and interest costs are added in,

the real cost will be well over $2 trillion,&#148; Wellstone said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;As a nation, this tax cut will make it impossible for us to live up to our

commitments to invest in our children, to quality education, to affordable

health care, and to establishing an affordable Medicare prescription drug

benefit for America&#146;s seniors.  The Senate made a grave mistake today that may

be with us for years to come,&#148; said Wellstone.</font></p>
