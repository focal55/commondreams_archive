- October 11 - The two most recent massacres carried out in the past few days by

paramilitaries in the northern department of Magdalena and

south-western department of Valle del Cauca demonstrate ever more

clearly why it is imperative to stop military aid from reaching

the Colombian army and their paramilitary allies, Amnesty

International said today.</font>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The only way to stop fueling the human rights crisis in

Colombia is to stop pouring  military aid into the country,&quot; the

organization added, at a time when the US Senate is about to

debate military aid to Colombia.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is inexcusable to continue sending military aid while

the Colombian government has not only failed to fully implement

reiterated UN recommendations to confront the human rights crisis

-- especially in relation to combating and dismantling

paramilitary groups --  but has passed legislation which

threatens to worsen the situation,&quot; Amnesty International said.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unconditioned military aid, over which there is little

end-use control, sends a clear signal to the Colombian army that

it is free to pursue its counter-insurgency strategy -- of which

paramilitary groups and their &quot;dirty war&quot; tactics are an integral

part -- thus permitting the continuation of the systematic and

widespread violation of human rights,&quot; the organization said. &quot;It

also has sent a dangerous message to the Colombian government

that its failure to fully implement UN recommendations to

confront impunity, combat and dismantle paramilitary groups and

guarantee the safety of human rights defenders is not an

impediment to continued aid.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Amnesty International noted that these two massacres

occurred shortly after the Colombian government ratified a

National Defense and Security Law which severely restricts the

capacity of the Office of the Procurator General to initiate

disciplinary investigations and provides the armed forces, in

some circumstances, with judicial police powers, which could

facilitate the cover up of serious human rights violations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The Law was passed at a time when several high-ranking

officers were implicated in judicial and disciplinary

investigations into cases of serious human rights violations and

massacres committed by paramilitary forces operating in unison

with the security forces.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is clear that the flow of US military aid is

encouraging the Colombian government to bolster the mechanisms of

impunity to protect the perpetrators of human rights violations,&quot;

Amnesty International said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background

On 10 October 2001, the bodies of 10 fishermen who had been shot

dead were found near Santa Marta in the northern Magdalena

Department. They were reportedly in a group of 20 fishermen

attending a party in Ci&eacute;naga Grande de Santa Marta who were

abducted by army-backed paramilitaries belonging to the

Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC, United Self-Defense Groups

of Colombia. The whereabouts of the remaining 10 are unknown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The second massacre took place in the communities of La

Habana and Alaska, in the municipality of Buga, southwestern

Valle del Cauca department. It is reported that army-backed AUC

paramilitaries entered the two communities and forced several

families out of their homes. They separated the men from the

women and children, made them lie face-down on the ground and

shot them dead. It is thought that at least 18 people were killed

during the paramilitary incursions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     In the context of Colombia's long-running internal

conflict between the security forces in alliance with

paramilitary forces and armed opposition groups, both sides have

shown flagrant disregard for human rights and international

humanitarian law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The security forces has pursued a counterinsurgency

strategy characterized by the systematic and widespread violation

of human rights. Civilians in conflict zones accused of being

guerrilla sympathizers or collaborators have subsequently been

the victim of extrajudicial executions, &quot;disappearance&quot; and other

serious human rights violations at the hands of the security

forces and their paramilitary allies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Guerrilla forces, of which the Fuerzas Armadas

Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, Revolutionary Armed Forces of

Colombia, and the Ej&eacute;rcito de Liberaci&oacute;n Nacional, ELN, National

Liberation Army, are the largest, have also been responsible for

frequent and numerous deliberate or arbitrary killings and

threats against those whom they consider to be collaborating with

their enemies. They are also responsible for around 57% of the

over 3,000 estimated cases of kidnapping and hostage-taking

recorded in the country a year.
