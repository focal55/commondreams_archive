- April 18 -  The Violence Policy Center

(VPC) today released Where'd They Get Their Guns? An Analysis of the

Firearms Used in High-Profile Shootings, 1963 to 2001, an examination

of 65 high-profile shootings over the past four decades. The report

provides details for each shooting including: the identity of the

shooter; the number of people killed and wounded; the make, model,

and caliber of the gun(s) used in the shooting; the circumstances of

the shooting; and, how the gun was acquired. The shooters in these

killings varied from school-aged children to disgruntled employees

to

lone-wolf assassins -- acting out of a wide range of motives.

<p>"This report reveals that most mass shootings involved handguns,

usually legally acquired," VPC Policy Analyst and report author Marty

Langley said today. "The message is clear, until we begin focusing

upstream at the gun manufacturers by regulating the gun industry

itself -- instead of relying on traditional gun control measures that

focus solely on the user -- killings of this type will continue

unabated."

<p>Among the study's findings are:

<p>In the 59 high-profile shootings from 1980 onwards:

<p>-- A handgun was used in 71 percent of the shootings (42 cases) as

the only or primary weapon, while in 29 percent (17 cases) a rifle

or

shotgun was used as the only or primary weapon.

<p>-- The handguns were acquired legally in 62 percent of the handgun

shootings (26 cases).

<p>-- The long guns were acquired legally in 71 percent of the

long-gun shootings (12 cases).

<p>In the 10 high-profile shootings in America's schools from October

1997 to March 2001, handguns were among the weapons used in nine of

the shootings. In eight of the 10 school shootings the guns were

obtained from a family member or friend of the shooter.

<p>Adds Langley, "This week, as we mark the second anniversary of the

Columbine massacre, we should more closely examine the source of

these devastating shootings and look toward a more comprehensive

approach to lessen the impact guns have on our lives."

<p><i>Where'd They Get Their Guns? is available from the VPC's web site

at <a href="http://www.vpc.org">www.vpc.org</a>. The Violence Policy

Center is a national non-profit

educational organization working to stop gun death and injury in

America.
