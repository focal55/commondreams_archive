Missile Defense Tests 

International Patience with Rogue Superpower, Group Says</div>

- July 12 - As the Bush Administration prepares to conduct a $100 million 

missile interceptor test this Saturday, it has given notice that 

this and all further tests mean nothing. The Administration wants 

to pursue an anti-missile system regardless of whether it can work 

or whether it complies with international law. Deployment of the 

anti-missile system also disregards the concerns of U.S. allies. 

President Bush is declaring the U.S. the ultimate rogue state. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the latest test nears, allied concerns about international 

law and cooperation have been rejected out of hand. The 

Administration has announced its intention to abrogate or violate 

the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the short rather than the long 

term. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the Senate Armed 

Services Committee that testing for a missile defense system would 

&quot;bump against treaty restrictions&quot; in months rather than years. 

This crisis in international affairs has been precipitated by the 

administration's decision to build a &quot;test bed&quot; for missile defense 

at Fort Greely in Alaska. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is an ill-concealed and dangerous attempt to circumvent the 

ABM Treaty. By building an illegal interceptor site without calling 

it such, the Administration is rushing a direct confrontation with 

the rule of international law and the system of non-proliferation 

and arms control that has for years kept the horror of nuclear war 

at bay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American people are being offered the illusion of security 

at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars,&quot; said Martin Butcher, 

director of security policy for Physicians for Social 

Responsibility (PSR). &quot;Prevention is the only cure for the disease 

of proliferation and nuclear war.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All this brinkmanship is in service of a system that doesn't 

work. Previous tests of the National Missile Defense have failed 

badly. Despite being set up in as simple a fashion as possible in 

order to ensure success, the Pentagon has shown itself time and 

again unable to reliably intercept incoming missiles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;PSR calls on Congress to prevent the Administration from making 

this appalling mistake,&quot; said Kimberly Roberts, PSR's associate 

director of security programs. &quot;Our Senators and Representatives 

must do all in their power to preserve the treaties and alliances 

that have helped keep us safe from nuclear war for thirty years. 

They should block any funding for projects which breach the ABM 

Treaty.&quot; </font></p>
