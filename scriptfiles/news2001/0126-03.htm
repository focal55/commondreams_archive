- January 26 - Greenpeace urged a global ban on the 

release of genetically engineered insects, following today's 

Wall Street Journal report that U.S. Department of 

Agriculture scientists and other researchers are poised to 

begin field experiments of genetically engineered 

"Frankenbugs." While proponents of genetic engineering 

claim these altered insects will solve pest and medical 

problems, Greenpeace cautioned that unanswered 

questions about this radical new technology could lead to 

unexpected side-effects that could devastate the 

environment and threaten human health.

<p>

Insects are being engineered to cause fatal abnormalities in 

crop pests or to be flying syringes that vaccinate people 

with every bite. Yet once released into the environment, the 

unintended side effects, or "biological pollution" from 

genetically engineered insects could lead to even greater 

problems than those they are intended to resolve. For 

example, the delivery of vaccines by altered insects could 

not be controlled, leading to harmful or even deadly adverse 

reactions in sensitive people.

</p>

<p>

GE insects once released cannot be recalled, nor can their 

further development and mutations be controlled. Many 

insect pests are known to have spread globally through 

international trade and tourism. "It's outrageous that 

government agencies that can't even keep genetically 

contaminated corn out of our food are considering releasing 

these experimental bugs," said Greenpeace Genetic 

Engineering Specialist Charles Margulis. "Any release of 

genetically engineered insects is inherently a global release 

and must therefore be dealt with by the international 

community." 

</p>

<p>

Vaccines can have severe side effects, and are thus 

administered under medical supervision, to control dosage 

and monitor for adverse reactions. With insects injecting 

vaccines routinely, such medical oversight would be 

impossible. Just this month, scientists reported that when 

they attempted to develop a vaccine by genetic engineering, 

they accidentally developed a deadly bioweapon instead. 

</p>

<p>

Experiences with medfly (The Mediterranean fruit fly), a 

serious crop pest, show that insect infestations cannot be 

contained within national boundaries. Medfly originated in 

tropical West Africa and was unknown in the U.S. before 

1929, when it was discovered in Florida. Today, farmers in 

California fear Medfly infestations more than almost any 

other pest, and control efforts require massive pesticide 

spraying.

</p>

<p>

"Every exterminator can tell these genetic tinkerers how 

difficult it is to eliminate troublesome insects even from a 

single house," said Charles Margulis. "Given the potential for 

massive and irreversible global environmental and health 

consequences, governments must take scientific 

precautions and ban the release of any genetically 

engineered insects."
