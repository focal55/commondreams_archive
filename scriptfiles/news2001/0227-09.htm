- February 27 - The Coalition for a democratic Pacifica in conjunction with Media Alliance 

and the KPFA Steering Committee call for a mass Rally and Picket outside 

the law offices of the firm of Epstein, Becker and Green in San Francisco, 

Wednesday, February 28, from 11:30 am - 1 PM at 2 Embarcadero Center.



<p>Listeners to KPFA FM, 94.1 who have been waging a battle against the 

corporate takeover the the country's oldest listener-supported radio 

network will rally to protest proposed illegal bylaws changes by John 

Murdock, a member of the Pacifica National Board of directors - and a 

member of the law firm of Epstein Becker & Green, the law firm retained by 

the Pacifica Foundation to defend itself against multiple lawsuits by 

stakeholders in Pacifica, the nation's oldest community supported radio 

network.  The proposed bylaws changes would effectively and 

undemocratically hand over power to a tiny group within the Pacifica Board 

- changes in apparent violation of state and federal law and of the 

principals the Foundation was formed to uphold, namely progressive, 

non-commercial, listener-supported free speech radio - changes which the 

listeners of KPFA and Pacifica have vowed to fight.



<p>The allegations in the lawsuits against Pacifica include that the directors 

of the Foundation sit on its board of directors illegally. Plaintiffs in 3 

major lawsuits have filed those actions based on the Foundation's efforts 

to liquidate the radio broadcasting assets of the Pacifica Foundation.



<p>Epstein, Becker & Green is one of the primary union-busting law firms in 

the United States, and Epstein Becker & Green member (attorney John 

Murdock) is a defendant in those lawsuits by virtue of his seat on the 

board of directors of the Pacifica Foundation.



<p>Epstein Becker & Green has also threatened to file lawsuits against Free 

Speech advocates on the Internet who are critical of the role the firm 

plays in Pacifica, critics who espouse support for the very principals upon 

which Epstein Becker & Green's client Pacifica bases its operating

principles.



<p>The rally will picket the law offices of Epstein, and will feature 

statements written by Danny Glover, Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, labor 

unions and other prominent progressives who defend the traditional role of 

Pacifica and who decry the attempted corporatization of the 51 year old 

radio network.
