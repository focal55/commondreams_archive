- February 26 - Amnesty International

USA (AIUSA) today welcomed the U.S. State Department's

comprehensive report on human rights documenting the status of

human rights around the world. The human rights organization

urged the Bush Administration to use this information in the

formulation of foreign policy.

<p>"Information is important, but action on human rights affects

people's lives," said William F. Schulz, AIUSA executive

director. "A critical test for the Bush Administration is

whether this information on human rights violations will be

considered in foreign policy decisions."

<p>Earlier in the day, Amnesty International USA released

Stopping the Torture Trade, a new report documenting that

U.S.-manufactured products become weapons of torture in many of

the same countries outlined in the State Department report.

Amnesty International's report found that U.S. companies were

more involved than any other country in the manufacture,

marketing and export of the type of weapons and other equipment

used in torture.

<p>"It is unconscionable that while the U.S. State Department

promotes human rights, the U.S. Department of Commerce has

approved export licenses to countries that our own government

documents as committing torture," Schulz said.

<p>In response to the State Department report, AIUSA provided

comment on countries in which human rights practices have been

of particular concern:

<p>China: The State Department assessment that the human rights

situation in China has "worsened" mirrors Amnesty

International's own report, Torture: A Growing Scourge in China

-- Time for Action, released earlier this month. Amnesty

International's report found that a growing range of officials,

from judges to family planning officers, are committing torture

in China and that their circle of victims is expanding.

<p>"The decision of the Bush Administration to sponsor a

resolution censuring China due to human rights violations is a

strong first step in setting the tone for U.S.-China relations,"

said Schulz. "But given China's deteriorating human rights record,

the U.S. must continue to demand that the Chinese government

improve its record on human rights."

<p>Colombia: Given the documented links between the Colombian

Army and other security forces with the paramilitaries, AIUSA

again questioned the U.S. commitment to a huge financial aid

package to Colombia. AIUSA is particularly concerned that

reports by a Colombian government official documenting

connections between paramilitary groups and Colombian military

brigades in Putumayo are not included in the State Department

report.

<p>Israel and the Occupied Territories: AIUSA noted an increased

candor from previous years in the State Department report on

Israel and Occupied Territories, but that there still exists a

marked difference in tone and tenor with how similar violations

are addressed in sections on other countries. For instance, the

State Department frequently reports Israeli government claims,

without independent verification. Amnesty International

reiterated its recommendation that the U.S. government conduct

investigations into whether the continuing flow of military

hardware to Israel violates U.S. law governing arms transfers.

That call was included in a recent Amnesty International report

documenting Israel's targeted killing of Palestinians.

<p>Russia: AIUSA urged that U.S. policy toward Russia take into

account the continuing and well-documented human rights

violations in Chechnya.

<p>Sierra Leone: Given that the State Department documents the

murderous rampage by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra

Leone, AIUSA urged the Bush Administration to support the "Clean

Diamonds" legislation proposed by Representatives Tony Hall

(D-Ohio), Tom Wolf (R-Va.) and Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.).
