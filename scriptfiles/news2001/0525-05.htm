- May 25 - &quot;We lock up peacemakers and give money and medals to warmakers,&quot; says

Frida Berrigan of the War Resisters League. &quot;What's wrong with that picture?&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Berrigan, a member of the longtime antiwar organization's Executive

Committee, is talking about the &quot;SOA 26,&quot; two dozen-plus activists

convicted Tuesday of criminal trespass in Columbus, Georgia. Yesterday a

federal judge sentenced them to jail terms ranging from probation to one

year for stepping peacefully onto the grounds of the U.S. Army's School of

the Americas at Ft. Benning last November 19.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	They were among 3,600 taking part in what has become an annual protest

demanding the closure of the school because of its links to the abuse of

human rights. All 3,600 stepped onto the base, but the 26 committed their

act in defiance of previous &quot;ban-and-bar letters&quot; prohibiting them from

trespassing at Ft. Benning for five years. At least seven of the 26 are

members of the War Resisters League; one, Clare Hanrahan, of Asheville, NC,

is currently a member of the League's National Committee, and Hazel Tulecke

of Yellow Springs, Ohio, has served on that body in the past.</font></p>

<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The War Resisters League is proud to have been represented in Ft. Benning

and proud that members of the League are among the SOA 26,&quot; says the

League's National Office Director, Melissa Jameson. &quot;They show by their

example that Gandhi's ideal of noncooperation with injustice is very much

alive in our midst.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	After the sentencing yesterday, a number of activists who had come to

Columbus for the trial&#151;Berrigan's younger sister Kate among them&#151;returned

to Ft. Benning in solidarity with the defendants. They were arrested and

released.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The sentences are long for simple trespass charges, observes the League's

Disarmament Coordinator Christopher Ney. Noting that New York's Rev. Al

Sharpton was also sentenced to jail time earlier this week, in his case for

trespass at the U.S. Navy base on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, Ney

said, &quot;These sentences might represent a crackdown on civil disobedience.&quot;	</font></p>
