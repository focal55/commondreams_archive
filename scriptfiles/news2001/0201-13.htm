- February 1 - Despite opposition from a broad spectrum of American public

interest groups, former Senator John Ashcroft was confirmed today as

Attorney General of the United States. Among many of his most contentious

beliefs is Ashcroft&#146;s devotion to the National Rifle Associate and other

pro-gun groups.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The NRA&#146;s promise of a place high in this administration has been

fulfilled,&#148; said Robert K. Musil, Ph. D., Executive Director and CEO of

Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR). &#147;John Ashcroft&#146;s relentlessly

pro-gun stance as a US Senator, Missouri Governor and Attorney General will

bring a dangerous precedent to the Department of Justice.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ashcroft&#146;s time as a Senator has seen him vote against all thirteen gun

measures considered during his tenure. He also recorded radio spots urging

Missouri voters to support a dangerous concealed weapons law, and received a

0% score on his environmental voting record as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Ashcroft&#146;s commitment to deterring environmental protection and thwarting

meaningful violence prevention measures is absolute,&#148; said Musil. &#147;We

opposed his nomination because we believed he would not be able to enforce

laws in which he doesn&#146;t believe. We are committed to closely monitoring his

tenure, as the progress we&#146;ve made despite his unflagging opposition in the

Senate is too valuable to see go untended.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Physicians for Social Responsibility is a national non-profit organization

committed to protecting environmental health and ending violence and its

causes. We represent over 20,000 physicians and health professionals. PSR

shared the 1985 Nobel Prize for Peace as the US affiliate of International

Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.</i>
