- May 2 - Facing new restrictions in

the waters of Hawaii, a fleet of longline fishing vessels are

relocating to California to avoid a federal judge's decision to

enforce protections for the endangered leatherback sea turtle. In

response, Turtle Island Restoration Network and the Center for

Biological Diversity, represented by Eathjustice, filed suit in the

U.S. District Court here today asking the National Marine Fisheries

Service to close this regulatory loophole and enforce the Endangered

Species Act.

</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The California-based pelagic longline fleet fishes primarily

for

tuna and swordfish using monofilament lines up to 30 miles long and

carrying thousands of hooks. In addition to the fish they target,

these longlines are known to ensnare the critically endangered

leatherback turtle, as well as loggerhead, olive ridley, and green

turtles. Each year the longliners also entangle thousands of

seabirds, such as albatross, and tens of thousands of sharks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The giant, Pacific leatherback is on the verge of extinction due

to commercial fishing operations," explained Todd Steiner, director,

Turtle Island Restoration Network. "If we don't modify our fishing

activities, the ancient leatherback, which out-survived the

dinosaurs, may be the first of many species to disappear forever,

including the many overfished species of fish on which we depend on

for food."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scientific data shows that the leatherback sea turtle is in

imminent danger of extinction in the Pacific. A recent paper in

Nature (June 2000) predicts the species will go extinct in 5-10 years

without reductions in adult mortality from fishing activities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The National Marine Fisheries Service must follow the law and

consider the impacts of this fishery on protected species under the

Endangered Species Act," said Deborah Sivas of Earthjustice. "The

agency should also move quickly to come into compliance with the High

Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 which prohibits permitting of

activity that 'undermines the effectiveness of international

conservation and management measures'."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 2001, Hawaii federal district court Judge David A.&nbsp; Ezra,

ordered the closure of the Hawaii-based longline swordfish fleet and

reduced fishing of the tuna fleet to reduce the longliners' impacts

on threatened and endangered sea turtles.&nbsp; Judge Ezra had previously

issued an injunction closing millions of miles of Pacific Ocean to

longline fishing, noting, "the harm to the turtles is incalculable."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Rather than comply with the Hawaiian injunction, the longliners

have chosen to move their operations to California, where the can

operate free of environmental review," said Brendan Cummings, an

attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. "The time has come

for the National Marine Fisheries Service to close this loophole and

help save the leatherbacks from extinction."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leatherbacks nest in Mexico and Costa Rica in the eastern Pacific,

and, in the western Pacific, in Malaysia and Irian Jaya. Although in

1980 it was estimated that there were 126,000 adult female

leatherbacks in the eastern Pacific alone, scientists estimate that

there are less than 3,000 leatherbacks of both genders left in the

eastern Pacific. The western Pacific nesting populations have also

been devastated, and are near extinction.
