- February 20 - President

                    George W. Bush has launched a major national drive to give

                    broad-based public funding to churches and other religious

                    groups to provide social services. As part of the

                    administration's crusade, Bush has created a new federal

                    agency, the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives

                    which formally begins operations today, that will work from

                    the White House to expand government aid to religious

                    ministries and create church-state &quot;partnerships.&quot;</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans

                    United for Separation of Church and State has taken the lead

                    nationally in opposing Bush's faith-based efforts. Here are

                    10 reasons why the president's campaign should be rejected.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1.

                    Bush's plan violates the separation of church and state.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under

                    the First Amendment, American citizens are free to decide on

                    their own whether or not to support religious ministries,

                    and the government must stay out of it. Bush's faith-based

                    plan turns the time-tested constitutional principle of

                    church-state separation on its ear.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At

                    its core, Bush's plan throws the massive weight of the

                    federal government behind religious groups and religious

                    conversions to solve social problems. While houses of

                    worship have played an important role in this country since

                    its founding, these institutions have thrived on <i>voluntary</i>

                    contributions. Forcing taxpayers to subsidize religious

                    institutions they may or not believe in is no different from

                    forcing them to put money in the collection plates of

                    churches, synagogues and mosques.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's

                    founders would be appalled at the Bush initiative. In 1811,

                    President James Madison vetoed a bill that gave federal

                    sanction to a church that provided aid and education to the

                    poor. Madison, widely regarded as the &quot;Father of the

                    Constitution,&quot; rejected the measure on First Amendment

                    grounds because it &quot;exceeds the rightful authority to

                    which governments are limited by the essential distinction

                    between civil and religious functions.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When

                    unveiling his legislative plan to Congress Jan. 30, Bush

                    said, &quot;Government, of course, cannot fund, and will not

                    fund, religious activities.&quot; This, however, is a

                    distinction without a difference. In most instances, the

                    services provided by religious ministries are explicitly

                    religious. The president, therefore, cannot honestly suggest

                    that he will &quot;change lives&quot; by funding religious

                    groups and maintain the façade that he is not also funding

                    religion.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2.

                    Federally funded employment discrimination is unfair.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under

                    the president's proposal, churches will be legally permitted

                    to discriminate on the basis of religion when hiring,

                    despite receiving public dollars. A Bob Jones-style

                    religious group, for example, will be able to receive tax

                    aid to pay for a social service job, but still be free to

                    hang up a sign that says &quot;Jews And Catholics Need Not

                    Apply.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In

                    other words, an American could help pay for a job but be

                    declared ineligible for the position because of his or her

                    religious beliefs. That's not compassionate conservatism,

                    that's outrageous. And under Bush's plan, it's perfectly

                    legal.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3.

                    Religion could be forced on those in need of assistance.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under

                    Bush's approach, religious institutions would receive

                    taxpayer support to finance social services and would still

                    be free to proselytize people seeking assistance. The

                    religious freedom of beneficiaries would therefore be

                    seriously threatened. Those in need may face religious

                    indoctrination when they are sent to a religious

                    organization to obtain their government benefits.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

                    president has promised &quot;secular alternatives&quot; for

                    those who don't want to be forced to go to a house of

                    worship for help. But in some instances, particularly in

                    rural and less populated areas, the closest

                    &quot;alternative&quot; can be a great distance away.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Imagine,

                    for example, a Jewish family looking for food and shelter in

                    Texas. The government tells the family they can visit the

                    Southern Baptist church nearby or travel 100 miles for help

                    from a &quot;secular alternative.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush's

                    policies will put the disadvantaged in an impossible

                    position. They will either submit to religious coercion or

                    go without food, shelter or other needed services to which

                    they are legally entitled. Placing people in need in this

                    kind of position is wrong.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4.

                    Bush's plan opens the door to federal regulation of

                    religion.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Government

                    always regulates what it finances. This occurs because

                    public officials are obliged to make certain that taxpayer

                    funds are properly spent. Once churches, temples, mosques

                    and synagogues are being financed by the public, some of

                    their freedom will be placed in jeopardy by the almost

                    certain regulation to follow.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Houses

                    of worship that have flourished as private institutions may

                    suddenly have their books audited or face regular spot

                    checks by federal inspectors in order to ensure appropriate

                    &quot;accountability.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In

                    an address at the National Press Club on Jan. 30, the Rev.

                    Wanda Henry, a Baptist minister, warned of the inevitable

                    regulations placed on houses of worship once they are

                    incorporated into the federal government's bureaucracy.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As

                    an ordained minister and person of faith dedicating my

                    professional life to the defense of religious liberty, I

                    have one piece of advice for church leaders: Say 'no, thank

                    you' to government funds for your religious

                    ministries,&quot; Henry insisted. &quot;You are doing just

                    fine without the heavy hand of government on your

                    back.&quot; She added, &quot;Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

                    said the church is not the master of the state, nor the

                    servant of the state, but the conscience of the state.

                    Charitable choice threatens to make religion the servant of

                    the state, rather than its conscience.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5.

                    The vitality of our faith communities will be hurt.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For

                    years, millions of Americans have become active with their

                    local houses of worship, making special contributions as a

                    way to strengthen their ties to their faith traditions and

                    increase personal piety. Once religious institutions are

                    working in tandem with the federal government and receiving

                    tax dollars to provide services, members may be less

                    inclined to &quot;dig a little deeper&quot; to help with

                    expenses.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once

                    these contributions drop off, the attendant spirit of

                    volunteerism may also wither away. Making religious

                    institutions dependent on the government for money will only

                    harm these institutions and their vitality in the long run.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6.

                    Bush's plan pits faith groups against each other.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since

                    the founding of the nation, all religious groups have stood

                    equal in the eyes of the law. With a separation between

                    church and state, government has been neutral on religious

                    issues and no specific faith tradition received favoritism

                    or support.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

                    Bush plan, however, calls for competition between religious

                    groups. For the first time in American history, religious

                    groups will be asked, indeed encouraged, to battle it out

                    for a piece of the government pie. Pitting houses of worship

                    against each other in this fashion is a recipe for divisive

                    conflict.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7.

                    Some religions will be favored over others.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While

                    on the campaign trail, Bush promised that he would &quot;not

                    discriminate for or against Methodist or Mormons or Muslims

                    or good people with no faith at all.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then

                    he announced he would not allow funding of the Nation of

                    Islam, because, as he sees it, the group &quot;preaches

                    hate.&quot; The president has not, however, explained how

                    the government will decide which groups preach

                    &quot;hate,&quot; and which preach &quot;love.&quot; Stephen

                    Goldsmith, who will be chiefly responsible for implementing

                    the president's plan, has indicated the administration may

                    also discriminate against groups affiliated with the Wiccan

                    faith.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

                    Bush plan is already on shaky legal ground; once the

                    president starts picking and choosing which faiths will get

                    government aid and which ones won't, the plan quickly starts

                    to drown in constitutional quicksand.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8.

                    There's no proof that religious groups will offer better

                    care than secular providers.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many

                    supporters of Bush's proposal have insisted that faith-based

                    institutions are better, and far more successful, than

                    secular service providers. However, little empirical

                    research supports these claims. Few studies have examined

                    whether religious ministries are more successful than

                    secular groups in providing aid or producing better results,

                    and it is unwise to launch a major federal initiative with

                    so little research in the area.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even

                    Goldsmith has acknowledged this fact. During a Jan. 29

                    interview on National Public Radio, Goldsmith was asked

                    whether there was &quot;hard proof&quot; of faith-based

                    efforts being more effective. Goldsmith answered,

                    &quot;No,&quot; and added, &quot;It would be, I think, a

                    mistake, both for this initiative and generally, to conclude

                    that just as a matter of assumption, that a faith-based

                    organization will always be better than a secular

                    organization.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There

                    is also no proof that America's religious communities will

                    be ready, willing or able to assist the many individuals and

                    families who now receive secular aid from the government. No

                    one knows if ministries will have the resources or staff to

                    accommodate a large influx of people who will have little

                    choice but to seek their assistance if Bush's plan is

                    implemented.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Complicating

                    matters, houses of worship are exempt from compliance with

                    the Americans with Disabilities Act. A person in need

                    confined to a wheel chair, for example, may not be able to

                    get in a church's front door to receive assistance, even if

                    he or she is willing to put up with religious

                    indoctrination.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>9.

                    Both liberals and conservatives are concerned about Bush's

                    plan.</b></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Controversies

                    surrounding Bush's scheme are not limited to a &quot;left

                    vs. right&quot; argument. Americans United is part of a

                    broad coalition of education, religious and civil liberties

                    groups opposed to Bush's faith-based plan. The coalition

                    includes organizations such as the NAACP, the Leadership

                    Conference on Civil Rights, the American Civil Liberties

                    Union, the National Education Association, the American

                    Counseling Association and the Baptist Joint Committee on

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerned

                    conservative leaders have also expressed reservations about

                    the plan. For example, representatives of the Cato

                    Institute, a conservative think tank, argued that mixing

                    government and charity is dangerous. Cato staffer Michael

                    Tanner said the Bush plan &quot;risks destroying the very

                    things that make private charity so effective.&quot;</font></p>

                    Scanlon, president of the Capital Research Center, another

                    conservative group, raised similar concerns.

                    &quot;Faith-based groups that have so far escaped the

                    outstretched hand of the federal government will discover

                    that it is a federal fist,&quot; Scanlon said.</font></p>

                    leaders from the African American community have also

                    expressed strong criticism of Bush's plan as well. Prominent

                    members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Reps.

                    Robert Scott (D-Va.) and Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.), have

                    already spoken out. They aren't alone.</font></p>

                    John Lewis (D-Ga.), a pioneer of the civil rights movement

                    in the 1960s and himself a Baptist minister, also expressed

                    deep concern. &quot; I think there has to be a strong wall,

                    a solid wall between church and state,&quot; Lewis said.

                    &quot;I don't want to see religious groups out trying to

                    convert or proselytize with federal dollars.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For

                    years, public funds have provided services at religiously

                    affiliated organizations. Catholic Charities and Lutheran

                    Social Services, for example, often have received government

                    grants and contracts. However, strict safeguards have been

                    in place to protect the interests of taxpayers and the

                    religious liberties of those receiving assistance.

                    Independent religious agencies, not churches themselves,

                    handled the public funds. Tax dollars supported only secular

                    programs, and no religious discrimination with public funds

                    was permitted.</font></p>

<font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Courts

                    found this approach to be consistent with the First

                    Amendment. Bush's plan radically alters that set-up by

                    allowing churches and other houses of worship to preach,

                    proselytize and discriminate while providing public

                    services.
