- March 7 -  The National Council of

Women's Organizations (NCWO), today condemns Congressional action

to kill new worker protections addressing repetitive motion

injuries. The ergonomics rule issued by the Clinton Administration

would have required the employers to provide safe workplaces and

compensate injured employees.

<p>"Thousands of women suffer workplace injuries each year and the

majority of the Members of Congress don't care" said Martha Burk,

Ph.D., Chair of NCWO. "From secretaries to nurses to needle trades

workers, repetitive motion injuries hurt American families."

<p>There are more than 106 million women in the labor force, and

women workers are particularly affected by these injuries. While

women make up 46 percent of the overall workforce, in 1998, women

accounted for 64 percent of repetitive motion injuries (42,347 out

of 65,866 reported cases) and 71 percent of reported carpal tunnel

syndrome cases (18,719 out of 26,266 reported cases).

<p>NCWO is the nation's largest coalition of women's organizations

representing more than 120 groups nationwide and over six million

women.

<p><i>The National Council of Women's Organization's (NCWO) is a

non-partisan, non-profit coalition of more than 120 women's

organizations across the nation collectively representing over six

million women. For years, NCWO has convened the leadership of major

women's organizations dedicated to focusing on national issues and

public policy agendas affecting women.
