- May 23 - The National Women’s Law Center assailed the Senate’s passage today of a $1.35 trillion tax cut because it will doom prescription drug coverage for Medicare, raid the Medicare Trust Fund and threaten Social Security, education, and other critical programs on which women and their families disproportionately depend.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Center expressed support, however, for a provision in the bill that will make the child tax credit refundable, making the tax credit available to millions of working families for the first time.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“This tax cut is still too costly, too risky and unfairly skewed to benefit a tiny handful of the wealthiest tax payers,” said Nancy Duff Campbell, NWLC Co-President.&nbsp;&nbsp;“As the process continues, it is essential that the provision making the child tax credit refundable survives because it is one of the few benefits for low-income families that exists in a tax plan which, as a whole, does very little for them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campbell explained that the provision making the child tax credit refundable will allow over 7 million families with over 15 million children to receive some of the child tax credit as a refund, all of whom would otherwise receive no benefit from the doubling of the child tax credit alone, another feature of the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The refundability provision will reduce the marginal tax rates of low-income families -- the vast majority of whom are headed by women -- who pay a substantial amount of their income to federal payroll taxes and to federal excise taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduction will do more to help these families enter and remain in the middle class than any other provision of the tax plan currently being debated,” Campbell said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Campbell expressed support for another provision in the bill that would expand the Dependent Care Tax Credit, helping more working families meet their child and dependent care expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Child care is a necessity for the vast majority of women with children -- 72 percent of whom are now working outside their homes -- and child care expenses are, on average, the third-largest expense for low- and middle-income families after housing and food.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Women’s Law Center is a co-chair of the Fair Taxes For All Coalition, an unprecedented coalition of more than 500 organizations nationwide working to reduce the size and improve the distribution of the Bush tax plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>
