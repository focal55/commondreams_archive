- January 23 - As the Senate debates the fate of the highly charged John

Ashcroft nomination, the Senators' constituents are weighing in. On

Capitol Hill today, boxloads of petitions urging the Senate not to

confirm Ashcroft as U.S. Attorney General are being delivered to

every Senator. The petitions, literally a ton of them unveiled at

a Capitol Hill news conference, were signed online by more than

130,000 Americans at People For the American Way's dedicated

website, <a href="http://www.OpposeAshcroft.com">OpposeAshcroft.com</a>, in just the first ten days of its

operation.

<p>The petitions delivered today were signed online between

Jan. 10 and 19 in an unprecedented outpouring of response to the

controversial nomination. PFAW's website has been flooded with

visitors who come to get the troubling facts about John Ashcroft's

6-year record as a U.S. Senator and his 16 years as Missouri's

Governor and Attorney General before that. Even though PFAW did not

do any advertising to promote the site, traffic has grown through

word of "mouse" over the internet, with the numbers of petition

signers swelling to well over 2,000 per hour by the end of last

week.

<p>"John Ashcroft's record shows that he has, time and again, set

himself against fundamental American freedoms, fairness, and equal

opportunity. He has distorted the facts about those whose disagree

with him on the issues, as well as the facts about his own record,"

said Ralph G. Neas, president of People For the American Way. "What

these petitions are saying today is: John Ashcroft is the wrong man

to entrust with our fundamental freedoms."

<p>At the news conference, Neas also announced that PFAW is

preparing to supplement its internet campaign with a print

advertising campaign to be unveiled later this week.

<p>Petitioners from every state have responded with alarm not only

to Ashcroft's extreme record on abortion rights, school

desegregation, civil rights, gun control, and other key issues, but

also to his attempts to mislead the Senate about his record and

actions when he testified before the Judiciary Committee last week.

<p>Neas noted at today's news conference that other organizations

that oppose Ashcroft have also had similar responses from their

constituents. "By the most conservative estimates," he said, "over

half a million Americans have already contacted their Senators -- by

petition, letter, postcard, e-mail, or phone -- urging a "no" vote.

And these are just the ones we know about."

<p>"We've never seen anything like this outpouring of concern,"

Neas continued. "We have a very activist-oriented website and high

traffic year-'round, but in just twelve days our website has

received over a million hits -- nearly matching our volume for all

twelve months of last year. There is a lot of unhappiness about

this nomination and Senators should pay attention to this

unprecedented public reaction."

<p>Even as the first batch of OpposeAshcroft.com petitions are

delivered today, tens of thousands more Americans a day are

clicking on the website to send their Senators an anti-Ashcroft

message. PFAW has promised the petitioners that it will continue to

deliver newly signed petitions as they come in.

<p>PFAW's OpposeAshcroft.com website contains the organization's

research reports detailing Ashcroft's troubling record as a public

official along with its latest report, reviewing his efforts to

mischaracterize or explain away that record in testimony before the

Senate Judiciary Committee, "Words vs. Deeds: John Ashcroft's

Attempt to Recast His Own Public Record and Statements."
