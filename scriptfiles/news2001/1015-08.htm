- October 15 - A judge ruled today that nine Greenpeace protestors and one freelance journalist, facing felony charges stemming from a peaceful protest against a missile defense test in California on July 14, 2001 can travel home before returning to Los Angeles for trial currently set for November 20, 2001. Since July 14 the nine defendants have been restricted to the Central District of California. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It has been too long and I am looking forward to seeing my friends, family and the people who have supported me,&quot; said one of the defendants. &quot;However, I am also looking towards my return here and having my day in court when my integrity will become public record.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's hearing was the latest legal battle for 15 Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists who were arrested by the F.B.I. near Vandenberg Air Force Base in California following a peaceful protest against the controversial missile defense program. All 17 including the journalists were charged with conspiring to violate a safety zone-a class D felony with a maximum six-year prison term and $250,000 fine. They were also charged with entering military property without permission-a misdemeanor with a 6-month maximum sentence and $5,000 fine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the six defendants from the United States were given immediate bail, the international defendants had their passports seized and all but one had their travel restricted to the central district of California. The international defendants are from Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Sweden and the United Kingdom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hopefully the public will get to know these defendants as we know them, individuals who have behaved with honor and courage,&quot; said John Passacantando, Greenpeace Executive Director in the United States. &quot;Voicing dissent and engaging in peaceful, non-violent protest are the duties of responsible, engaged citizens in democracy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During today's hearing, the defendants plead not guilty to the second superceding indictment. </font></p>
