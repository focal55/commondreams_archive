- June 13 - Employer-sponsored 

health insurance benefits for private-sector workers through 

their own jobs have declined since the late 1970's within most 

industries, and low-wage workers are affected the most, 

according to a new report from The Commonwealth Fund. In 

examining trends over a 19-year period, the report, How the New 

Labor Market Is Squeezing Workforce Health Benefits, by James L. 

Medoff and colleagues at the Center for National Policy, finds 

that two-thirds of private-sector workers had health insurance 

coverage through their own employers in 1979, but just over half 

did by 1998. The decline was sharpest for those earning the 

least, with rates of own-employer coverage falling from 42 to 26 

percent for workers in the bottom fifth of the hourly wage 

scale. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Those who can least afford to be without health insurance 

are most likely to be without job-based benefits,&quot; said Cathy 

Schoen, vice president for health policy, research, and 

evaluation for The Commonwealth Fund. &quot;This is a disturbing 

trend that deserves priority attention from policymakers as well 

as private business leaders. Low-wage workers are at risk of 

being shut out of the health care system.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lowest-Wage Workers Are Hardest Hit 

The most striking drop was among those earning the least. From 

1979 to 1998, the proportion of blue-collar and service 

employees receiving health coverage through their own jobs 

declined from 63 percent to 43 percent. For white-collar 

workers, the decline was much less steep -- from 69 percent to 

60 percent. While only one-fourth of workers in the bottom fifth 

of the wage scale -- those earning less than $7.00 an hour -- 

had health benefits from their own employer in 1998, 80 percent 

of those who were among the top fifth of wage-earners received 

health coverage through their own jobs. Overall, employees are 

now also far more likely to pay a share of their health coverage 

premiums: while 45 percent of employers paid the full share of 

premiums in 1983, just 26 percent did so in 1998. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This shrinkage in health benefits is only partly explained by 

a shift in the economy away from manufacturing and toward 

service jobs, since the decline was seen in all industries. The 

shift toward larger firms in the service sector helped offset 

losses. Decline in Employer Coverage Linked to Rising Uninsured 

Rates The changing nature of the labor market has contributed to 

the decline in worker health benefits and the continuing rise in 

Americans without health insurance. &quot;One side effect of these 

trends,&quot; said Maureen S. Steinbruner, president of the Center 

for National Policy, &quot;is likely to be more pressure on family 

health benefits. The big question will be how to share the costs 

of premiums for the spouses and children of workers, especially 

those at the low end of the wage scale.&quot; </font></p>
