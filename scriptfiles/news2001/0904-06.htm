- September 4 - A new Gallup poll, sponsored by The Interfaith AllianceFoundation, finds that people who identified themselves as conservatives

with deeply religious values overwhelmingly reject the notion that

restricting donations to political campaigns would be a violation of the

Constitutional right to freedom of speech.  This view is contrary to the

position of groups such as the Christian Coalition, which strongly opposes

campaign finance reform on those grounds.  More than half of the people of

faith surveyed reported that campaign finance reform was very important to

them.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results of this survey suggest that people of faith have complex views on

political participation and campaign finance reform that are not accurately

represented by groups such as the Christian Coalition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of this nationwide poll of people of faith and clergy, as well

as feedback from ten focus groups, will be released at a press conference at

the National Press Club on September 6 at 9:00 a.m. After a briefing on the

poll data by The Gallup Organization, national experts on campaign finance

reform and religion will discuss the findings and their implications on the

Congressional debate. Questions in the survey included:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Do you think changes to the campaign finance laws would encourage members

of Congress to be more or less ethical and honest?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Do you think changes in the campaign finance laws would make the political

election system work better than it does now, or work worse than it does

now?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--Have you ever contributed any money to a political party or to some other

political interest group?</font></p>
