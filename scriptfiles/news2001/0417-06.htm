- April 17 - Today American Lands

released "A Vision For Protecting and Restoring Eastern Forests"

to highlight the unique values found in eastern forests, discuss

the threats they face and offer fresh ideas on how to solve

these problems. Eastern forests have abundant diversity of plants,

fish and wildlife with many species that live nowhere else on

Earth. Regretfully, air pollution, invasive species, off-road

vehicles, coal mining, roadbuilding and logging are combining

to undermine the recovery of eastern forests and threaten this

unique biodiversity.

<p>"Eastern forests have begun to recover from the destructive past

logging, but now the timber industry has shifted its attention back

to this region," said Kristen Sykes, eastern forest advocate for

American Lands. "New statistics now show that logging east of the

Mississippi is at unsustainable levels and now exceeds logging in

the West." According to Forest Service data, logging currently

exceed growth for softwoods and if current trends continue the same

will be true for hardwoods by the end of the decade.

<p>"This vision can only be accomplished by halting threats to

forests and by investing resources into ecological restoration,"

said Sykes. "There is tremendous potential to create jobs restoring

eastern forests which have been heavily damaged by logging,

roadbuilding, energy development and invasive species."

<p>The backlog for road maintenance alone on National Forests is

$8.4 billion and tens of thousands of miles of road have been

identified in the Forest Planning process for decommissioning. "We

estimate it could take decades of work to restore functioning

forest ecosystems in the east by fixing the road system and

rehabilitation degraded watersheds," said Sykes.

<p>Other important opportunities may be lost if the Bush

Administration continues to promote resource extraction and

environmental rollbacks over the health of our children and the

protection of the environment.

<p>"The National Forest roadless area protection policy protects

important areas of biodiversity in the East that have the potential

to become wilderness," said Sykes. "The Bush Administration

recently failed to defend the roadless policy in court is likely to

abolish the plan with an out of court settlement in favor of the

timber industry. The President should reverse course and support

what had been the most popular land protection initiative in a

hundred years since the National Forests were created in the first

place."

<p>"In response to the `energy crisis' eastern forests are

threatened by renewed development of oil, gas and coal," said Jim

Kleissler, Allegheny Defense Project. "National Forests in the East

are threatened by new drilling and mining projects because in most

cases, the government does not own the subsurface rights and cannot

prevent harmful new developments on public lands."

<p>"There is both a federal rule making and legislation to reduce

air pollution that is harming human health and high-elevation

eastern forest due to acid rain deposition and ozone," said Harvard

Ayers, Ph.D., of Appalachian Voices. "Like many other proposed

regulations to protect the environment and public health, the Haze

rule under consideration by the Environmental Protection Agency is

at risk of being overturned by the Bush Administration."

<p>Other critical problems such as the invasion of harmful pests

and the growing use of off-road vehicles have barely begun to be

responsibly addressed.

<p>"Numerous invasive species in eastern forests are threatening

trees including elm, dogwood, hemlock and maples, which are being

weakened by air pollution and made much more susceptible to these

pests," said Faith Campbell, director of American Lands Invasive

Species Program. "The American Chestnut once dominated eastern

forests, but it has been completely extirpated due to the invasive

chestnut blight."

<p>"Dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles are running rampant and

harming eastern forests and streams due to a lack of law

enforcement on the National Forests," said Alix Davidson recreation

campaigner for American Lands. "Without stronger measures to

enforce existing regulations and monitor the impacts, user

conflicts and environmental harm off-road vehicles will only

increase in the future."
