- July 12 - Michael D. Barnes, 

president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence 

(formerly Handgun Control) today issued a statement denouncing 

the National Rifle Association's (NRA) claim in a full-page ad 

in The Washington Post this week that certain provisions of the 

McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill violate free 

speech. Specifically, the NRA objects to the bill's language 

that would prohibit outside groups from using &quot;soft&quot; campaign 

financing money to fund political issue advertisements within 60 

days of a general election, or 30 days of a primary election if 

those ads refer to a specific federal candidate. A similar 

version of the McCain-Feingold bill was introduced in the House 

by Christopher Shays (R-Ct.) and Marty Meehan (D-Mass.), and 

will soon come to a vote before the full House of 

Representatives. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I have two questions for the NRA. One: When will NRA 

leaders stop using blatantly misleading statements and 

sensational rhetoric in its attempts to frighten the American 

people into opposing responsible measures that are in the 

long-term, best interests of the United States? And two: What 

is the NRA so afraid of? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This legislation will affect all advocacy groups, including 

ours. Of course the NRA doesn't want to change the status quo 

because, as The Los Angeles Times pointed out this week, it got 

its money's worth in the last election. The Bush Administration 

is beholden to the NRA due to its enormous campaign 

contributions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Look at the evidence from this week alone: first, an Under 

Secretary of State spouted the NRA line when he told a United 

Nations conference that its sensible proposals to thwart illegal 

firearm trafficking were a threat to legal gun ownership. Then, 

Attorney General Ashcroft directs the Department of Justice to 

reverse the U.S. Government's long-standing position on the 

Second Amendment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This bill does not violate the First Amendment, rather, it 

represents an opportunity to 'level the playing field' and 

reform a structure that is in dire need of repair. It promotes 

a system where it is not just money that talks. Perhaps that is 

what has the NRA so nervous,&quot; Barnes stated. </font></p>
