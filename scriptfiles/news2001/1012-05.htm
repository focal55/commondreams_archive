<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - October 12 - In response to requests 

from teachers and youth workers, international humanitarian aid 

agency Oxfam America is developing a section on its Web site 

called All About Afghanistan for Kids and Teachers. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elementary school teachers can use this to introduce students 

to the crisis in that country and the conditions under which 

kids and their families are living, as well as background 

material on the country and its people. It will also include a 

variety of related educational and fundraising activities 

appropriate for the classroom. These free materials will be 

available by the end of the day today and will be continuously 

updated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the meantime, Oxfam currently has materials posted on our 

web site that can be used as a resource for older audiences, 

including middle school, high school and university students. 

These materials include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A fact sheet on the Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan <br>

-- Background information on Afghanistan <br>

-- Updates on the current crisis <br>

-- Oxfam's response to the humanitarian crisis <br>

-- A site map of Oxfam's projects in Afghanistan <br>

-- Maps of the area <br>

-- Frequently Asked Questions regarding the humanitarian crisis </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam has supported programs in Afghanistan for 12 years, 

focusing on food relief, water and sanitation delivery and 

projects to promote democracy and women's rights. Oxfam is 

uniquely positioned to deliver aid effectively because our 

programs rely on Afghan staff, as well as Afghani organizations 

to deliver the food to communities in need. By not relying on 

foreign nationals, we enjoy the cooperation of Afghanis who are 

trusted leaders in their communities. This trust and commitment 

is crucial in a war-torn and fractured society. In addition, 

Oxfam professional staff trained in emergency water and 

sanitation relief systems is considered among the best in the 

world at meeting the immediate needs of swelling refugee camps. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oxfam has a 27-year history of educating the public about 

issues of poverty and hunger through our Fast for a World 

Harvest campaign. For more information and to download or order 

any of the above-mentioned free materials, please visit the Web 

site at <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org" target="_new">www.oxfamamerica.org</a>. Teachers can also receive
