- April 24 - The Association of State Green

Parties (ASGP), the U.S. federation of state parties

that organized last year's Green Party Nomination

Convention in Denver, voted to sign on to the boycott

of major U.S. oil companies that funded the campaign

to elect George W. Bush last year.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of the boycott is to pressure President Bush

to rejoin the Kyoto Treaty and begin implementing

steps in the United States to reverse global warming. 

&quot;U.S. oil companies -- the main target -- have been

given ten days to detach themselves from the Bush

decision,&quot; said Arnold Cassola, secretary general of

the European Federation of Green Parties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The boycott was called and approved unanimously by

Green Parties from 70-plus nations attending the

Global Greens 2001 Conference in Canberra, Australia,

from April 14 through 16.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens around the world urge consumers, governments,

and organizations to boycott ExxonMobil, Texaco,

Chevron, and their subsidiaries around the world. 

Greens in the U.S. urge American-based organizations

concerned about climate change and the Bush

Administration's reckless policy to endorse the

boycott.</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Energy crisis&quot; or manipulation of public policy?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Popular anger directed against the oil industry, after

the Monday, April 23 announcement of ExxonMobil's

record 51% first quarter profit increases over last

year, the result of rises in oil and gas prices during

an &quot;energy crisis,&quot; is expected to help propel the

boycott.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have insisted that the energy crisis and high

prices are the result of deregulation of the oil

industry and manipulation of public sentiment in order

to win greater economic leverage, greater control over

public policy, and unlimited access to oil in

restricted sites in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and

other environmentally sensitive areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In targeting three global corporate contributors to

George W. Bush's national campaign, the Green call for

an oil boycott addresses both the crisis in global

climate change and the control corporations maintain

over the American political system and policy on the

environment, labor and other human rights,

international trade, etc.  </font></p>

RESOLUTION FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF STATE GREEN PARTIES</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(passage reported by Greg Gerritt, ASGP secretary, on

Monday, April 23, 2001)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A resolution sponsored by the Steering Committee of

the ASGP endorsing the global boycott of Exxon-Mobil,

Texaco, and Chevron corporations due to their

activities on global warming issues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Background: The Executive Branch of the government of

the United States has decided that it does not wish to

go forward with the Agreement negotiated in Kyoto,

Japan, the Kyoto Agreement, which provides a framework

for the reduction of Greenhouse Gas emissions. The

United States has demonstrated its disregard for this

important issue by not moving forward on standards for

Carbon Dioxide emissions and by public statements on

the Kyoto Agreement.

 

&quot;It is reasonable to assume that the Executive Branch

has been influenced in its decision by the campaign

contributions by gigantic corporations in the Oil

Business, specifically Exxon-Mobil, Texaco, and

Chevron, and the close association between President

Bush and these corporations.  At the recent Global

Green Summit delegations from Green Parties around the

world called upon people everywhere who are concerned

out Global Warming to join a boycott of irresponsible

oil companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Resolution: The Association of State Green Parties

wholeheartedly endorses a boycott of the products of

Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, and Texaco, and will do

publicity for the boycott, call on others to endorse

and join the boycott, and especially help State Green

Parties to coordinate their efforts around this

boycott.  This boycott shall continue until the United

States Government takes substantial and concrete steps

towards both the dramatic reduction of Greenhouse Gas

emissions and Global Treaties to ensure greenhouse gas

emissions are dramatically lowered. The boycott

against a particular member of the corporate

triumvirate can be called off if that corporation

publicly repudiates the policies of George W. Bush,

swears off campaign contributions to politicians who

support polluters, and takes concrete steps to

significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;</font></p>
