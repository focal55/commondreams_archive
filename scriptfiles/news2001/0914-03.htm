- September 14 -  Amnesty International today reiterated its deepest sympathy for

the victims of the heinous attacks in the USA and called upon the

leaders of governments and community groups around the world to

ensure respect for human rights in their wake.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Amid growing evidence of a backlash and attacks against

Muslim and Middle Eastern community groups around the world,

Amnesty International stressed that efforts to bring the

perpetrators of these atrocities to justice must be characterised

by the highest respect for human rights.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The violent attacks suffered by the USA represent the

gravest violation of the most basic of human rights.

Perpetrators must be brought to justice. But in seeking justice

for the victims of this terrible crime, the world must exercise

the highest respect for the rights of all individuals.

International solidarity  with the victims is not about seeking

revenge but about cooperating within the rule of law in bringing

those responsible to justice.  Scapegoating individuals or

communities will achieve nothing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Calling for calm in the days and weeks ahead, Amnesty

International said, &quot;it is important for us all to see that

hatred does not become the order of the day;  that fear does not

become an excuse for the violation of rights and that we all

remember our common humanity.  We must be compassionate in our

support for the victims, determined in our search for justice and

vigilant about the rights of all people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Addressing the USA, Amnesty International asked the

authorities to set a leading example by ensuring adequate

protection for individuals and communities in the USA and by

maintaining the highest standards in their search for the

perpetrators of the attacks, including not detaining or arresting

individuals solely on the basis of their race, ethnicity,

religion or national origin.
