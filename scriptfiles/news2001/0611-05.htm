- June 11 - President Bush&#146;s policy announcements on global warming are an enormous disappointment and show that the Bush Administration still fails to take global warming seriously, said officials at the World Resources Institute today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before leaving for his first state visit to European countries, President Bush announced two research initiatives to coordinate climate science research and to develop technological solutions to the global warming problem. He also again rejected any legal restrictions on emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol, opting instead to let industry set its own limits. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Pres. Bush is recycling ideas from 1992 when the first global warming treaty was signed by his father. They are not bad ideas but they just do not go far enough. In six short months, Pres. Bush has set us back ten years -- doubting the science, weakening public policy, and undermining global cooperation,&quot; said Dr. Nancy Kete, director of WRI&#146;s climate, energy and pollution program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She added that leading scientists have repeatedly stressed that global warming is real, is getting worse, and that the consequences of not changing course will be irreversible. &quot;President Bush is saying he takes global warming seriously, but these proposals are extremely timid and ten years too late. If this is the best he can do taking it seriously, what would not seriously look like?&quot; Dr. Kete said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States, with 4.6 percent of the world&#146;s population, is the world&#146;s leading emitter of greenhouse gases, with roughly 25 percent of the global total. Europe, with 6.5 percent of the world&#146;s population, only accounts for 15 percent of the total. U.S. emissions are more than 10 times per person those of many developing countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush proposals are very weak tea,&quot; said David Sandalow, a senior fellow at WRI and former Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, Environment and Science. &quot;The President criticizes the Kyoto Protocol, but offers no serious alternative, no basis for negotiations, and no path to solving the problem. If the purpose was to demonstrate to Europeans and the American public that the Bush Administration takes global warming seriously, this speech was a failure.&quot; </font></p>
