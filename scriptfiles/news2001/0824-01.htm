- August 24 - Under cloak of a 

Congressional recess, James E. Cason, a former developer and 

protrgr of James Watt, was appointed Associate Deputy Secretary of 

Interior by Gale Norton on August 9. Preliminary research by 

Friends of the Earth and Earthjustice discovered that the position 

of Assistant Deputy Secretary has never existed under previous 

administrations and appears to be subverting Congressional approval 

of top agency officials. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Apparently the Bush Administration has taken to creating new 

positions at Interior in order to ram more appointees with 

pro-extractive industries, anti-environmental interests down the 

throat of the American public,&quot; said Kristen Sykes, Friends of the 

Earth Interior Department Watchdog. &quot;Like Norton and Griles, James 

Cason has been a soldier for moneyed interests who seek to exploit 

public lands for personal profit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1986 Cason played a key role in the Interior Department's 

decision to resume selling titles to federal oil and shale tracts 

for $2.50 an acre, far below their market value. He then proceeded 

to approve the granting of titles to some 82,000 acres, even though 

Congress had made clear its intent to revise the program. One set 

of claims, 17,000 acres, was purchased by private developers for 

$42,000 and sold months later for $37 million. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, Cason approved a revision of Federal audit 

regulations that would have saved 12 major oil companies millions 

of dollars in unpaid or underpaid royalties. According to press 

reports, Cason signed this deal on the stationary of the oil 

companies' attorneys. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the official job description obtained from the 

White House by FoE, the most troubling aspect of the Cason 

appointment is that he will have sweeping powers to act on behalf 

of Deputy Secretary of Interior J. Steven Griles without being 

subject to the scrutiny of the Senate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March 1989, Cason was a nominee for Assistant Secretary of 

Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment under the first 

Bush Administration but his nomination was derailed because of 

concerns over his anti-environmental views and allegiance to big 

business. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) remarked at the time, &quot;I am 

deeply disturbed about reports that Mr. Cason has repeatedly 

advocated positions at the department of Interior that reduce 

returns to the taxpayer from federal resources and undermine sound 

protection of the environment.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We already know that this Bush administration has become a 

second home for bureaucrats from the previous Bush and Reagan 

administrations,&quot; said Maria Weidner of Earthjustice's White House 

Watch. &quot;But now they're filling positions with rejects from those 

administrations too.&quot; </font></p>
