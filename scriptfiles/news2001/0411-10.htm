- April 11 - On April 4, USA Today announced the results of its long-anticipated

re-examination of Florida ballots (done in conjunction with the Miami

Herald) with the headline: &quot;Newspapers' Recount Shows Bush Prevailed in Fla.

Vote.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The headline touting a Bush win referred to the paper's estimate of what

would have happened if the U.S. Supreme Court had not blocked the hand

recount of 60 Florida counties that had been ordered by the state Supreme

Court. The paper found that Bush likely would have won such a recount.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But USA Today's investigation also found something else-- something it chose

not to tell its readers: The official hand counts in the remaining seven

Florida counties, completed before the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in, had

missed hundreds, even thousands of potential Gore votes. If those votes had

been properly counted, under two of the four counting standards used by the

paper to determine valid votes, Gore would have won the entire state by 300

to 400 votes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper examined ballots from all 67 counties in Florida, but it only

*reported* the results from 60 counties where hand counts were unfinished

(except on the paper's website, USAToday.com). The paper's decision to

exclude its findings in seven counties was based on its strategy of trying

to answer only one narrow question: What would have happened if the U.S.

Supreme Court had not stepped in and stopped the manual recounts in Florida?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The paper therefore included only the *official* results from the seven

counties, even though its own investigation found that the official results

had potentially missed enough Gore votes to change the outcome of the

election. None of this was revealed to USA Today's readers. The April 4

article explained that the &quot;official counts were final and would not have

changed if the U.S. Supreme Court had not stopped the hand recount.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In making this decision, USA Today failed to report some of the most

newsworthy aspects of its own ballot review. The Miami Herald, which worked

with USA Today on the study, also played down the fact that the

re-examination showed that Gore got more votes than Bush under two of the

four standards (4/4/01).  But the Florida paper at least provided its

readers some valuable information about the limitations of the official

recounts from the seven counties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Herald explained in an April 5 follow-up story that canvassing boards in

Broward and Palm Beach counties &quot;could have credited hundreds more ballots

to the Democrat if they had counted every dimple, pinprick and hanging chad

as a vote, a review of ballots in both counties shows.  In Broward, where

the official hand recount added 567 votes to Gore's county lead over Bush, a

Herald-sponsored ballot review found that Gore's margin could have been

1,475, if every mark had been counted as a valid vote. In Palm Beach, where

the official hand recount added a net gain of 174 votes to Gore's tally, the

Herald-sponsored review found a potential Gore net gain of 1,081.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Herald also reported on April 4 that the standards used in the original

manual recount were not applied consistently: &quot;The review found that

canvassing boards in those counties discarded hundreds of ballots that bore

marks no different from those on scores of ballots that were accepted as

valid presidential votes. Had those ballots instead been counted as valid

votes, allowing dimples, pinpricks and hanging chads, Gore would be in the

White House today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">USA Today's investigation does indeed provide evidence that if the U.S.

Supreme Court had not stopped the statewide manual recount ordered by the

Florida Supreme Court, George W. Bush might well still have been declared

the winner of the Florida election, and could still have become president.

This is a newsworthy finding, and it deserved to be reported.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the larger question of the Florida election is who actually received

more votes. The statewide totals USA Today chose not to report do much more

to answer that question than the paper's more limited look at the effect of

the U.S. Supreme Court decision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">USA Today justified not reporting its statewide results by saying that it&quot;did not want to substitute its judgment for that of election officials.&quot; If

that's the case, why recount the votes at all? After all, it was &quot;election

officials,&quot; including Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris and the

Supreme Court majority, who decided that most ballots that needed to be

manually recounted should be ignored. If, on the other hand, election

officials are not infallible, then a news outlet should present as much

information as it has about what actually went on during the election.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the effect of the U.S. Supreme Court decision is an important

question, the question of who actually got more votes in Florida is even

more important. By not reporting vital information, USA Today has violated

journalistic principles and further confused the public about a subject that

surely needed no more confusion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTION: Please contact USA Today and let them know that  concealing the full

statewide results of its investigation of undervotes was a disservice to

readers.</font></p>
