<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 8 - Taxpayers would foot 

  the bill for $38 billion in tax breaks and other giveaways to big oil, electric 

  utilities and nuclear power under the House energy legislation passed in early 

  August, according to a new report released today by the U.S. Public Interest 

  Research Group (U.S. PIRG).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These giveaways to polluting 

  industries would not only waste taxpayer dollars but also would do virtually 

  nothing to provide for America's energy future,&quot; said Anna Aurilio, Legislative 

  Director of U.S. PIRG. &quot;Increasing energy efficiency and producing more 

  energy from clean, renewable sources will help reduce the vulnerability of our 

  energy supplies, create jobs, save consumers money and protect the environment,&quot; 

  added Aurilio. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG's report-- <a href="http://pirg.org/alerts/route.asp?id2=4134" target="_new">Polluter 

  Payday</a>-- found that these handouts could have profound implications for 

  American taxpayers. U.S. PIRG estimated that the tax breaks and subsidies for 

  polluters would cost taxpayers $38 billion-only slightly less than the $38.9 

  billion in tax rebates mailed out to taxpayers in 2001. In fact, in 15 states-including 

  Florida, New Mexico, and Texas-the cost of these handouts to polluters would 

  exceed the total amount rebated to the states' taxpayers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S.PIRG identified more than 100 

  corporations in polluting industries that would benefit from the House energy 

  plan's handouts. U.S. PIRG's analysis shows that these corporations recorded 

  revenues in excess of $1.6 trillion in 2000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group was joined at the press 

  conference by Cena Swisher, Senior Director of the Green Scissors campaign for 

  Taxpayers for Common Sense, a fiscal conservative group, and Lynnea Smith, a 

  member of the Concerned Citizens of T'iistsoozi-Crownpoint, NM, representing 

  ENDAUM (Eastern Navajo Din&eacute; Against Uranium Mining) and SADD (Students 

  Against Destructive Decisions.) Smith spoke of her group's concerns about H.R.4's 

  $30 million in subsidies for uranium mining, saying, &quot;The bill will support 

  companies such as Uranium Resources, Inc., whose operations will contaminate 

  our precious water and will severely harm my Navajo people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG also strongly denounced 

  the recent efforts by some Senators to attach dirty energy policies to federal 

  anti-terrorism legislation in the name of national security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Those pushing for a plan to 

  address energy and national security are partially correct,&quot; said U.S. 

  PIRG Research Director Alison Cassady, the author of the report. &quot;America 

  needs a long-term national energy policy. But the House energy legislation will 

  only deepen our dependence on oil and other polluting sources. It's just not 

  the answer,&quot; continued Cassady. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG called on the Senate to 

  reject the fundamentally flawed House energy legislation and support proactive 

  policies for cleaner, more affordable energy solutions that benefit consumers 

  rather than polluters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The House energy plan is simply 

  out of balance with America's current priorities. The vast majority of the bill 

  supports dirty energy sources, while devoting barely a quarter of its subsidies 

  and tax breaks to energy efficiency and renewable energy,&quot; added Aurilio.</font></p>
