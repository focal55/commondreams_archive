- October 15 - WAND, Women's Action for New Directions*, stands with the global community 

to condemn the attacks of September 11th, mourns the lives lost, and calls 

for those responsible to be brought to justice.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From the ashes of this destruction rises an unprecedented opportunity for 

the United States to set a profound and positive example in its response to 

this unimaginable violence. Our response should entail:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Restraint. Our government should exercise restraint in its response so 

that no more innocent lives are destroyed. The US should reject the use of 

nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Responsibility. Congress must fulfill its constitutional responsibility 

to maintain checks and balances by debating and shaping our response and 

preventing any branch of government from acting unilaterally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Resources for true security. Meeting human needs is the foundation of 

true security and resources to meet those needs must not be sacrificed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Respect for others. In this time of crisis, each of us is called to 

renew our respect for civil liberties, demand a free and informed press, 

and create a safe and civil environment that encourages open dialogue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Reduce Risks. This tragedy requires all Americans to examine carefully 

the steps our country may now take to reduce the risk of future terrorist 

attacks. The US should work cooperatively with the international community 

through treaties, initiatives and institutions toward global security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even as we mourn the lives lost, we can be an example to the world by 

refusing to perpetuate violence upon the innocent and renewing our 

commitment to meeting human and environmental needs, which are the 

foundation of true security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>*Women's Action for New Directions (WAND) is the only national grassroots 

organization brining the voices of progressive elected and activist women 

into federal policy debates and elected office. Since the early 1980s, WAND 

has been empowering women to act politically to reduce violence and 

militarism, and redirect excessive military resources toward unmet human 

and environmental needs.</i>
