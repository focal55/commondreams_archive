- September 18 -  

Congress has approved resolutions giving

the President 40 billion dollars and open-ended authority to use military

force. The Senate and House have authorized him to attack any nation,

organization or person involved in or that aided the September 11 terrorist

attacks. The resolutions name no county or group as targets and contain no

time limit. The only positive aspect of these resolutions is the fact that

President Bush sought and received the approval of Congress, as the

Constitution requires. However the use of unlimited military force that the

resolutions allow is dangerous, irresponsible policy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A massive military response against a country, presumably Afghanistan,

appears unwarranted and could potentially kill thousands of civilians. The

initial steps should be to identify, extradite, try and punish the

perpetrators of these acts in a court of law. Only if this fails should

force be used for effectuating arrests. The focus should be on the

perpetrators and organizations; it should not be on wars with other nations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employing military force out of anger, for purposes of retaliation or to

satisfy domestic outrage is unlawful and does nothing to end terrorism.

Massive bombing continues the cycle of violence that invariable creates

sympathizers who become the new terrorist. War will make us more vulnerable.

In the wake of the embassy bombing in East Africa the U.S. used military

tactics striking Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan killing

innocent people. This did not stop or even slow terrorism. Arguably, those

actions may have sown the seeds of September 11.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dangerously this congressional resolution contains no time limit, no

congressional oversight and no requirements that the President ever come

back to Congress for additional authority.  This, unlike prior

authorizations of force e.g. authorization to use force in Lebanon, gives

the President unlimited power without the checks and balances of the

Constitution. It eviscerates congressional control over the use of force and

puts the power of war into the hands of one man, leading us quickly from

democracy to one-man rule.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution permits the use of military force against nations that

&#147;aid[ed]&#148; the September 11 attack &#147;Aid&#148; is a vague, broad concept that may

permit attacks on nations with only a tenuous relationship to the terrorist

acts. This determination will be made with no congressional check and

without any requirement of congressional approval.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President should obtain the authority of the U.N. Security Council to

use military force. This is what his father did in going to war against

Iraq. Multilateral action through the U.N. will be more effective in

fighting terrorism than going it alone, obtaining such consent is both

responsible law and policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, we share in the hope that those responsible for these heinous acts

will be caught and punished. But we fear that the course our country is

currently embarked upon is fraught with danger for us all.
