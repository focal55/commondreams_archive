- June 25 - Greenpeace is calling on car consumers to send Ford a message: show you're serious about reducing pollution by embracing the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming. The move is another setback for the U.S. auto maker, which has invested millions to improve its public image in the environmental and safety areas. Ford, and its Chairman, William Ford, Jr. have actively courted the media and environmental groups in an effort to earn the company a green label. Mr. Ford spoke at a Greenpeace forum in London earlier this year, where he made several promises about improving his company's environmental record. The company bought a full page ad last month in three major papers professing its concern for global warming.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford's green rhetoric is like a hood ornament - it may look pretty but it does nothing for performance,&quot; said Kert Davies, Greenpeace Climate Campaign Coordinator. &quot; Ford needs to put substance to its words by supporting the Kyoto Global Warming Treaty.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace contends that Ford is in lock step with the Bush administration and its corporate allies when it comes to the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, Ford is a member of a business lobbying group, the U.S. Council of International Business (USCIB), which has actively supported President Bush in his efforts to kill the Protocol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace views the Kyoto Protocol as an important first step in the international communities' efforts to cut CO2 emissions, the major greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. The overwhelming scientific consensus states that human activity is causing global warming, it's getting worse and only action now can prevent more problems in the future. The Kyoto Protocol calls for mandatory cuts in CO2 emissions, a standard supported by environmentalists, and some companies and governments around the world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ford risks falling into the environmental scrap-heap if it sticks to its line opposing the Kyoto targets for cutting greenhouse pollution,&quot; said Davies. &quot;Ford's current position leaves them in the same camp as GM, Exxon-Mobil and the other corporate polluters of the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace has placed an action alert on its U.S. and international web sites, urging activists to email Ford about the Kyoto Protocol. As of June 19, 2001, close to 8,000 such emails had been sent, with thousands more expected in the coming weeks. In addition, Greenpeace is helping to organize protests at Ford dealerships across the country at the end of June, hitting the auto maker during a busy sales period.<br>
