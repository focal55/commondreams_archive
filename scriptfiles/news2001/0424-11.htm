- April 24 - The final declaration of

the just concluded Summit of the Americas shows a disappointing lack

of commitment to incorporating social or environmental concerns into

free trade negotiations, WWF said today.

<p>While the declaration talks about balancing economic development,

social development and the protection of the environment, WWF noted

that it carefully avoids any direct commitment to including these

issues in the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiations

themselves. The language of the Quebec Declaration appears to

contradict a statement signed by Western Hemisphere trade ministers

just a few weeks prior to the Quebec Summit. That statement, released

on April 7th in Buenos Aires, declared that the FTAA negotiations

themselves would take account of broad social and economic issues,

including environmental protection. The Quebec Declaration thus

leaves in doubt whether hemispheric leaders have embraced the need

to

address conservation and sustainable development in the context of

"free trade."

<p>"The results in Quebec reveal how far we still have to go if we

are to make trade in the Americas serve the real needs of people and

of our planet," said David Schorr, director of WWF's Sustainable

Commerce Program. "We are still a long way from getting a commitment

to sustainable trade in the FTAA."

<p>Some of the rhetoric surrounding the Quebec City summit was more

hopeful. President Bush told the assembled leaders that the

commitment to open trade under the FTAA "must be matched by a strong

commitment to protecting our environment." The Bush administration

also announced it would continue the Clinton Administration's policy

of conducting environmental assessments of trade agreements.

<p>"It is clear -- and it is a welcome sign -- that the Bush

administration has not simply written off environmental concerns in

the context of the FTAA," said Schorr. "But words need to be matched

by serious actions to put conservation and sustainable development

at

the core of trade negotiating goals."

<p>WWF noted with particular concern that the Quebec Declaration

repeats the assertion that increased trade will automatically lead

to

prosperity and ultimately to an improved environment.

<p>"The 'grow now, clean up later' approach has been widely

discredited among serious environmental economists," said Schorr.

"It's just crazy to think that all you have to do to achieve

sustainable development is open your borders and sit back while the

private market takes care of the rest."

<p>WWF has long called for a balanced approach to trade and

environment, and believes that the proposed Free Trade Area of the

Americas (FTAA) potentially offers important opportunities to achieve

real gains for conservation and sustainable development.

Unfortunately, the FTAA negotiations so far have kept trade talks

isolated from environmental considerations, and from public input.

Protests and riots in the streets of Quebec were the predictable

result.

<p>"While WWF does not condone violent protest, the refusal of

governments to open the FTAA process to the public is completely

unacceptable," said Schorr. "Trade policies remain far too

subservient to the interests of a wealthy commercial elite. If the

only way people can make their legitimate voices heard is in the

streets, then governments will need to get used to diplomatic dinners

scented with the odor of tear gas."

<p>In a statement released during the Summit, WWF laid out five tests

the FTAA must meet if it is to truly promote sustainable development.

The FTAA should:

<p>1. Deliver concrete benefits for conservation and sustainable

development,

<br>

2. Strengthen good environmental governance,

<br>

3. Avoid anti-environmental biases, such as those found in NAFTA's

controversial investment rules,

<br>

4. Embrace and open, balanced and participatory processes, and

<br>

5. Build capacity in developing countries.

<p>"If the FTAA is to help address the real needs of the Western

Hemisphere -- its people and its ecosystems -- governments across the

region will have to go beyond rhetoric to embrace a process that

delivers real benefits for communities and for the environment," said

Schorr.
