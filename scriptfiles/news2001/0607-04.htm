- June 7 - In Congressional 

testimony today, Dr. Paul Zeitz, a medical doctor with a 

specialization in international public health and epidemiology, 

called for a massive increase in U.S. government action to stop 

AIDS, particularly in Africa. He called for a comprehensive 

response, citing the need for deeper debt cancellation to free 

up additional resources to fight AIDS and a multibillion dollar 

emergency appropriation from the U.S. Congress. He also called for 

access to AIDS medications including through generics and global 

bulk purchasing. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Zeitz represents the Global AIDS Alliance, a broad, 

international coalition of religious, humanitarian, consumer and 

social justice groups, many of which are active in providing 

services in Africa and other regions in impacted by AIDS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The years I worked in Zambia brought home to me the reality 

of the AIDS crisis. My Zambian work colleagues started dying,&quot; 

Dr. Zeitz told the House Committee on International Relations. 

&quot;I was shocked and devastated when I learned that the AIDS death 

rates that I was observing won't peak for another five years 

until 2005 and then they will stay high for at least another 10 

to 15 years. The international and the U.S. response is 

failing.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zeitz said USAID and other agencies need the resources to do 

their job. &quot;Bipartisan Congressional support is required to 

ensure that new and supplementary resources are appropriated for 

USAID and other Agencies. The low level of U.S. foreign 

assistance persists in spite of widespread support among the 

American people for greatly increased assistance to impoverished 

countries, as documented in several recent surveys. We can and 

must turn this around.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zeitz praised the establishment of the Global AIDS and Health 

Fund. &quot;The United States should commit to provide its share of 

the cost of the $10 billion per year Global AIDS and Health Fund 

by appropriating $3 billion this year. President Bush's recent 

announcement of a $200 million contribution to this Fund, is a 

small start, but remains woefully inadequate.&quot; Zeitz also voiced 

concern about a top-down approach to date. &quot;So far, civil 

society has had a limited and marginalized role in discussion 

regarding the Fund.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Zeitz also called for full access to treatments. &quot;It is 

outrageous from both a practical and a moral standpoint that 

more than 99 percent of Africans are not able to obtain 

practical life-saving medications. With access to antiretroviral 

medications, prevention is more likely to succeed. And, we can 

keep parents alive to raise their children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 23 countries that received HIPC debt relief so far, 15 

still have annual debt service payments higher than what the 

country is currently able to spend on basic health care. &quot;That 

doesn't make sense from a public health standpoint. Immediate 

debt cancellation by the IMF and the World Bank for countries 

enrolled in the HIPC program could provide over half a billion 

dollars per year for the HIV/AIDS fight. This would cost the 

American taxpayer nothing and would not negatively affect the 

lending ability of these institutions.&quot; </font></p>
