- June 26 - Two major shifts are taking place 

              in America's War on Drugs. In recent months, several highly respected 

              political leaders, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, former 

              Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, 

              and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, have openly questioned 

              the damage done to our society by the War on Drugs. Bush administration 

              officials seem to be headed in precisely the opposite direction. 

              Attorney General, John Ashcroft, and recently appointed Drug Czar, 

              John Walters, have both promised to escalate the drug war.

<p>Meanwhile, a growing number of Americans are weary of the War on 

              Drugs. A recent ABC News poll found that 69 percent of adults prefer 

              treatment rather than incarceration for drug offenders. Last year, 

              Californians passed Proposition 36 (61%), which will send non-violent 

              first-and second-time drug possession offenders to treatment instead 

              of prison.</p>
