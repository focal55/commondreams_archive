- March 20 - The Sierra Club today expressed grave concern over the Bush

Administration's decision to withdraw the recently revised standard for

cancer-causing arsenic in America's drinking water. The move rejects an

effort by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this year to

protect more than 22 million Americans from this poison, further delaying

the much-needed and long-awaited clean-up and signaling another Bush

Administration bow to the mining industry.

<p>

"EPA scientists know the level of cancer-causing arsenic in our drinking

water is unsafe and should be lowered," said Carl Pope, Executive Director

of the Sierra Club.  "This decision suggests the Bush Administration is

caving to the mining industry's demands to allow continued use of dangerous

mining techniques. The current guidelines for arsenic in drinking water,

based on 1942 data, are dangerously outdated."

<p>

"This move is the latest in several recent environmental attacks by Bush

that put industry ahead of the American public," continued Pope.  "Along

with delaying the arsenic rule, he reversed a campaign promise to reduce

emissions of carbon dioxide and delayed the protection of the last

remaining wild areas of our national forests."

<p>

The arsenic-reduction rule withdrawn today would have provided additional

protection to 22.5 million Americans from cancer and other health problems,

including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as developmental and

neurological effects.  After decades of study, the Bush Administration will

stall by demanding more public comments.

<p>

According to the National Academy of Sciences, long-term exposure to low

concentrations of arsenic in drinking water can lead to skin, bladder,

lung, and prostate cancer. Non-cancer effects of ingesting arsenic at low

levels include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and anemia, as well as

reproductive and developmental, immunological, and neurological effects.

<p>

The EPA's statement that further public comment is required ignores 25

years of public comment, debate and missed statutory deadlines. In 1975,

the EPA adopted the 1942 Public Health Service (PHS) arsenic standard as an

"interim" measure, promising to revise it promptly based on modern science.

The PHS recommended the arsenic standard be lowered to ten parts per

billion in 1962. In January, 2001, after decades of regulatory development,

public comment, debate, millions of dollars in EPA research, and at least

three missed statutory deadlines (in the 1974, 1986, and 1996 Safe Drinking

Water Acts), the EPA finally issued the new 10 parts per billion standard.

<p>

"While some arsenic occurs naturally, the mining industry's operations

widely pollute our drinking water with arsenic and other toxic metals,"

said Ed Hopkins, Director of Sierra Club's Environmental Quality program.

"Americans cannot afford to delay new protections against arsenic any

longer. The Bush Administration needs to focus more on the needs of

Americans and less on the demands of special interests like the mining

industry."
