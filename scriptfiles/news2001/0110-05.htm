- January 10 - The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition along with 

        the AFL-CIO, Black Leadership Forum, Congressional Black Caucus, National 

        Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and concerned citizens 

        will unite forces and march to the State Capitol building in Florida on 

        January 20th, 12 Noon.<br>

        <br>

        This consortium of freedom fighters includes labor, civil rights, religious, 

        women, human rights, and educational groups; all whom have pledged to 

        continue to empower the movement for social change. <br>

        <br>

        "As the new administration is sworn in, we will turn our attention to 

        the chicanery that occurred on November 7th and the crowning of a new 

        president that followed. We, as people of faith, will remain rooted in 

        our struggle for equal protection under the law and work to secure our 

        franchise," remarks Jackson.<br>

        <br>

        The rally will embrace a renewed voter registration and voter education 

        campaign. In addition to serving as a peaceful and non-violent celebration 

        of the tremendous African American voter turnout and will call upon the 

        nation to honor voting rights as guaranteed in the Constitution.<br>

        <br>

        Jackson will follow a host of other scheduled speakers such as: Joseph 

        Lowery, Black Leadership Forum, John Sweeney, AFL-CIO, Dennis Rivera, Rainbow/PUSH 

        and Kweisi Mfume, NAACP. <br>

        <br>

        The march will commence at the Tallahassee Civic Center at 11:00 AM, and 

        travel to the State Capital Building for a 12 Noon rally. (Buses should 

        assemble at 9:00 AM at the Civic Center).
