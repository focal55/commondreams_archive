- July 2 - The Creative Coalition today 

called on President George Bush to oppose the Media Marketing 

Accountability Act of 2001 (S.790; H.R. 2246) sponsored by Sens. 

Lieberman, Kohl, Byrd and Clinton, and Reps. Israel and Osborne. The 

bill grants the government, for the first time, the power to monitor 

and police the marketing of creative material. In addition, the 

legislation would grant the government the power to punish those 

producers who do not comply. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that entertainers, parents and lawmakers should work 

in concert to curb the marketing of entertainment to our country's 

young people,&quot; William Baldwin, president of The Creative Coalition 

said. &quot;However, the approach that Sens. Lieberman and Clinton have 

taken is the wrong one and sets a dangerous precedent.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) report which said 

that the marketing practices of the entertainment industry had 

improved, and the FTC's recommendation that vigilant self-regulation 

is the best approach, Sen. Lieberman and his colleagues introduced 

the sweeping Media Marketing Accountability Act which the industry 

sees as a threat to First Amendment protection. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 18, The Creative Coalition sent a letter to Sens. 

Lieberman, Kohl, Byrd and Clinton signed by more than 50 arts 

and entertainment professionals and supporters from across the 

country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last 10 months, the entertainment industry has taken 

proactive and strong steps to stop the marketing of violence to 

children and ensure accountability within the industry. Those steps 

include a set of 12-point initiatives adopted by the Motion Picture 

Association of America. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those initiatives include: 

-- Requiring member theater owners not show movie trailers rated R 

for violence before G-rated films; 

-- Not knowingly include persons under the age of 17 in focus 

groups; 

-- Appoint senior executives to regularly review marketing 

practices; and 

-- Seek ways to include the rationale behind a particular rating 

in print advertising and web sites for the films in order to better 

inform parents. </font></p>
