- March 16 -  Reacting to today's court action here,

conservationists warned that the Roadless Area Conservation Rule

assigned on January 5, 2001 - the most significant national forest

conservation measure of the past 100 years - is under attack and in

danger of being rescinded. In response to a court challenge seeking

to overturn the new rule filed by Boise Cascade Company, the state

of Idaho and others, the U.S. Justice Department today suggested

that implementation of the policy be delayed yet again. Federal

judge Edward Lodge of the Idaho District Court will now decide

whether to grant the extension.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Bush Administration showed its cards today," said Tim

Preso, attorney for Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, which along

with Natural Resources Defense Council is representing eight

environmental groups in the issue. "This appears to be a calculated

first step by the Administration to avoid offering any defense of

the roadless policy. By asking for another delay rather than

vigorously defending the rule, the Bush Administration is giving us

every reason to believe they're planning to bring bulldozers back

into our national forests. And certainly this is a far cry from the

vigorous defense of the rule Attorney General Ashcroft promised in

his confirmation hearings."

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roadless areas are portions of the national forest system where

precious habitat is preserved for wildlife and clean water as well

as for many activities such as hiking, hunting, fishing and

camping.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Roadless Area Conservation Rule protects the last remaining

one-third of unspoiled national forest land from commercial

logging, road construction and other damaging activities. More

than 50 percent of the roughly 190 million acres of national forest

land is already open to logging, mining and other extractive

industries. The Forest Service issued the rule to protect 58.5

million acres of forestland after a three-year administrative

process that involved more than 600 public meetings (including more

than 40 in Idaho) and that drew a record-breaking 1.6 million

public comments.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Roadless areas are essential for clean water that not only

benefits people, but also provides great habitat for fish," said

Sara Denniston of Idaho Rivers United. "Leaving roadless areas

pristine goes a long way toward protecting the blue ribbon

fisheries of many Idaho rivers including Kelly, Cayuse and Long

Canyon Creeks and the upper Middle Fork Payette River, among

others."

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost immediately after his inauguration, the Bush

Administration ordered all recent Clinton Administration rules and

policies to be halted, pending review. In early February, the Bush

Administration announced that the roadless policy, scheduled to go

into effect March 13, would be delayed until May 12, pending

further review. Conservationists charge that today's second delay

clearly indicates that the Bush Administration has no intention of

upholding the law as it is written in spite of repeated claims by

cabinet members that they would do so.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They're manipulating the judicial system to keep the American

people out of their backroom efforts to rewrite the law in a way

that is more pleasing to their friends in the timber industry,"

said William H. Meadows, president of The Wilderness Society.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two separate lawsuits before this court currently seek to

overturn the roadless policy. The Boise Cascade suit includes Boise

and Valley Counties, a handful of livestock companies and off-road

vehicle groups and the Kootenai Tribe. The state of Idaho and Idaho

Governor Dirk Kempthorne have filed the second lawsuit.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"They're going to tell you that the whole process leading up to

the roadless decision was flawed because the public wasn't

adequately informed," concluded Preso. "But after 600 public

meetings and 1.6 million comments, it's clear the public was

informed and spoke out in favor of protecting our last pristine

forests. It's not the process but rather the outcome that they

don't like. All signals indicate this policy is in serious danger."
