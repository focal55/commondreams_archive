- April 18 - Friends of the Earth (FoE), in cooperation with other environmental groups and concerned Americans, led a protest against President George W. Bush today for his egregious disregard for the environment. FoE, which gathered a large group of protesters with signs and banners, lambasted the &quot;Toxic Texan&quot; for more than a dozen major blows dealt to the environment and public health in the US and around the world. <br>

  <br>

&quot;Environmentalists knew from the start that Bush was going to be bad for the environment,&quot; said FoE president Brent Blackwelder. &quot;But Bush's disregard for the environment, indeed for the safety of the American people, is completely outrageous. He needs to stop thinking about his campaign contributors and think about the children he is poisoning instead.&quot; <br>

  <br>

In his first one hundred days, Bush repealed safe arsenic standards in water, broke a campaign promise to curb carbon dioxide, targeted the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling, endangered laws that protect our national forests, dropped safety requirements for mining, abandoned the Kyoto global warming treaty, and designated an anti-environmental cabinet as &quot;stewards&quot; of the American environment. <br>

  <br>

&quot;Bush is truly the 'Toxic Texan,'&quot; said Blackwelder. &quot;He held one of the worst environmental records as governor of Texas. Now he's trying to surpass that by garnering the worst environmental record of any US president, and compromising public health in the process.&quot; <br>

  <br>

FoE distributed a top ten list entitled &quot;The Toxic Texan at Work: Bush's Environmentally Harmful Actions&quot; at the protest. It can be viewed on FoE's watchdog web site, <a href="http://www.presidentbushwatch.org/">www.presidentbushwatch.org</a>.<br>
