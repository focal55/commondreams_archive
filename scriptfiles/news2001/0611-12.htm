- June 11 -  News Advisory:

<p>WHAT: June 12 Capitol Hill press conference highlighting

Congressional opposition to the Bush administration's push for

missile defenses features members of Congress who oppose it, and

have just heard from their constituents that they do, too. Part

of a three-day series of events organized by national citizens'

groups to voice broad-based public opposition to the Bush

administration's missile defense plans, the press conference is

the culmination of two days of meetings between constituents

from 40 states opposing missile defenses and their

representatives in Congress.

<p>WHO: Participants available for interviews at the June 12

press conference include, among others:

<p>Confirmed:

<br>-- Rep. Bob Filner, 50th district, California

<br>-- Rep. Barney Frank, 4th district, Massachusetts

<br>-- Rep. Rush Holt, 12th district, New Jersey

<br>-- Rep. Janice Shakowski, 9th district, Illinois

<br>-- Rep. John Tierney, 6th district, Massachusetts

<br>

-- Jonathan Granoff, Arms Control Advisor, American Bar

Association

<br>

-- Tracy Moavero, program director, Peace Action

<br>

-- Susan Shaer, executive director, Women's Action for New

Directions

<br>

-- Dr. Peter Wilk, former president of Physicians for Social

Reponsibility

<br>

-- Frank von Hippel, chairman of Federation of American

Scientists, Princeton professor, former Assistant Director for

National Security at the White House Office of Science and

Technology Policy

<p>Unconfirmed:

<br>Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)

<br>Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.)

<p>WHEN &amp; WHERE: 12 noon, Tuesday, June 12, outdoors in the SE

triangle, located behind the House side of the Capitol building.

<br>

&nbsp;

<p>BACKGROUND:

<br>

The press conference illustrates growing resolve in Congress

and in the electorate not to allow the White House to ram

through its missile defense agenda either at home or abroad,

just at the moment Democrats who are skeptical of NMD assume

leadership of key Senate committees.

<p>Opponents say missile defenses would be monumentally costly,

unworkable, and damaging to US national security and strategic

relationships. Friday Senate majority leader Tom Daschle said,

"every aspect of the debate and the consideration given to this

whole program is troubling to me."

<p>New legislation is pending in Congress to move ahead with

nuclear weapons reductions and reaffirm U.S. commitment to the

arms control treaty regime that missile defenses would abrogate.

&nbsp;

<p>In recent days some 40,000 e-mails, 6,000 signatures and over

10,000 snail-mailed messages opposing NMD have poured into

Washington, and continue to arrive at the rate of over 1000 a

day. The messages will be presented to members of Congress at

the press conference.

<p>Polls show the more Americans learn about NMD, the more

strongly they oppose it. A new ABC/Washington Post poll also

shows a slipping 55 percent approval rating for President as he

departs for meetings with the EU, NATO and Russian President

Putin, where he will confront strong NMD opposition, and where

he cannot legitimately argue missile defenses have broad-based

support from the majority of Americans.

<p>The June 12 press conference takes place on the first day of

Bush's trip. It is also the anniversary of the largest

demonstration in U.S. history: a 1982 rally in Central Park

where over a million protestors opposed the nuclear arms race

and galvinized a national movement against Reagan's Star Wars

intitiative.
