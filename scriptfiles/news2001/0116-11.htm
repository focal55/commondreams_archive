- January 16 - While California&#146;s two biggest utilities -- Pacific Gas &amp;

Electric and Southern California Edison (SCE) -- claim to have racked up such significant

losses that they are facing bankruptcy, their parent companies have embarked upon a

billion-dollar spending spree, spending nearly $20 billion on power plants and other

purchases over the past few months. These purchases far exceed their stated $12 billion

debt from California operations, a

Public Citizen analysis shows.

<p>The finding is particularly significant in light of a proposal by California Gov. Gray

Davis that the state use its credit to buy electricity from power producers and sell it to

the two utilities at cost. Proponents argue the deal is necessary because PG&amp;E and SCE

claim that their lack of credit may prohibit them from purchasing the power California

needs. Rather than assume the utilities&#146; financial risk, the state of California

should purchase or seize electric generation plants from the owners currently manipulating

prices.</p>



<p>The governor&#146;s deal will make matters worse for California consumers because it

shifts risk from investor-owned utilities to the taxpaying public, Public Citizen has

concluded. The arrangement does nothing to address the roots of California&#146;s energy

crisis: deregulation, which has allowed price manipulation on the wholesale market, and

poor financial planning by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and SCE. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, PG&amp;E and Edison International, the parent companies of the two

utilities, have spent billions in acquiring international and out-of-state investments

over the past several months, according to Public Citizen&#146;s report, <i>Claiming

Poverty in a Sea of Riches: New Investments by Parent Companies Belie California

Utilities' Claims of Bankruptcy</i>. The parent companies should be forced to sell off

these assets before having the state act as a surrogate debtor, Public Citizen says. In a

double blow to California consumers, PG&amp;E has successfully persuaded the Federal

Energy Regulatory Commission to allow it to shield these newly acquired assets if Pacific

Gas &amp; Electric were to file for bankruptcy. </p>



<p>&quot;This back-room deal will place the state in dire risk, because it continues the

failed policy of deregulation,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.

&quot;Taxpayers should not shoulder the utilities&#146; financial responsibilities until

the utilities sell off billions in out-of-state assets they irresponsibly purchased just

months ago.&quot;</p>



<p>The report details how Edison International, primarily through its Mission Energy

subsidiary, has invested more than $10 billion outside the California market since

December 1998. These $10 billion in recent purchases are double the $5 billion in debt SCE

claims it has incurred this year under deregulation. Edison International also has spent

$2.35 billion in stock buyback plans since deregulation began.</p>



<p>PG&amp;E, mostly through its National Energy Group subsidiary, has made at least $9

billion in new purchases and construction since 1999. This exceeds the $6.6 billion debt

Pacific Gas &amp; Electric claims it has accumulated under deregulation. PG&amp;E also has

initiated more than $1 billion in stock buyback plans since deregulation began. The report

describes how these investments were funded in large part by California consumers in the

first few years of deregulation.</p>



<p>&quot;PG&amp;E&#146;s aggressive attempts to shield its assets should be a warning to

California lawmakers that the utilities are not acting in good faith,&quot; said Wenonah

Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program.

&quot;California consumers helped pay for these billion-dollar investments under

deregulation, so these assets -- not taxpayer-funded credit guarantees -- must be the

first line of defense against deregulation&#146;s failure.&quot;
