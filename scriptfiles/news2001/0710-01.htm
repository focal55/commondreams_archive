- July 10 - As the International Whaling Commission prepares to meet in London in less than two weeks, a new report released by World Wildlife Fund today discloses serious threats which further endanger the survival of the world's whales. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, &quot;Wanted Alive! Whales in the Wild&quot;, points out that seven of the thirteen great whale species remain endangered or vulnerable despite decades of protection from whaling. Experts are becoming increasingly alarmed over the growing list of hazards that could put more species of cetaceans -- i.e. whales, dolphins and porpoises -- on the endangered list. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whales are besieged by a long list of man-made threats,&quot; said Karen Baragona, a co-author of the new report and a WWF whale expert. &quot;Whaling is often the first danger that springs to mind, but it may come as a surprise that there are even more destructive forces out there conspiring against the world's whales: entanglement in fishing gear, toxic chemicals, intensive oil and gas development, habitat degradation, and the effects of climate change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the past three decades, accidental entanglement in driftnets and gillnets has caused the death of thousands if not millions of cetaceans. In the last few weeks, many have followed efforts off New England's coast to free a severely entangled North Atlantic right whale whose injuries are life-threatening. Entanglement in fishing gear plus collisions with ships pack a devastating one-two punch that could knock out this beleaguered species, which has shown no signs of recovery since the days of whaling. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest research suggests that industrial chemicals and pesticide run-off are among the gravest threats to whales. Mounting evidence shows that chemicals that accumulate in whales' blubber can harm their health. Large concentrations of these chemicals are being passed from mothers to their nursing calves and potentially interfering with development. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These often-invisible risks are becoming apparent at a time when whales are still struggling to recover from the years of over-hunting that drove many species to the brink of extinction,&quot; said Elizabeth Kemf, another co-author of the report. The Atlantic population of gray whales actually did became extinct due to whaling. The hard-hit Western North Pacific gray whale now numbers at just 100 to 200 animals, and North Atlantic right whales -- the first targets of commercial whaling -- are holding tenuously at around 300. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whale hunting continues, despite a moratorium on commercial whaling enacted by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1986. &quot;If whaling cannot be ended or brought under very tight international regulation, it remains a potentially serious danger for the remaining whales, together with all the other mounting threats.&quot; said Cassandra Phillips, WWF's Senior Policy Advisor on whales and a co-author of the report. Each year over 1,000 whales are still being hunted for the commercial market. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF is taking a number of actions to protect whales. These include helping develop measures to reduce collisions between right whales and ships in Canada, and taking steps to minimize gear entanglement of highly endangered cetacean species in problem areas around the world, including Mexico, the Philippines, and New Zealand. WWF is also supporting carefully controlled whale watching, which can be a lucrative alternative to whaling. In Iceland, which this year rejoined the IWC and threatens to resume commercial whaling, recent analysis suggests that the economic value of whale watching may now exceed what would be gained by whaling. WWF continues working to bring whaling under the strictest possible control of the International Whaling Commission, as well as to secure international agreements to reduce the effects of climate change and toxic chemicals. </font></p>
