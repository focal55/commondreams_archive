- July 6 - &quot;This is a transparent ploy to undermine birth control and abortion rights by

granting 'personhood' to embryos and fetuses,&quot; said NOW President-elect Kim

Gandy, responding to reports of a Bush administration policy to allow

states to

define a fetus as a person under the Children's Health Insurance Program,

purportedly to cover prenatal and delivery services.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If George W. wanted to let states cover pregnant women under this program,

he'd simply grant a waiver to every state that requested one -- something Bill

Clinton had already started doing in January. Better yet, let's require this

coverage,&quot; said Gandy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW challenges the White House and Bush supporters in Congress to mandate

health coverage of low-income pregnant women. But this seems unlikely, since

they already advocate cutting funds for such programs,&quot; Gandy continued. &quot;All

of these machinations have a political goal that is important to George W.

Bush

-- limiting birth control and abortion.&quot; Gandy noted that President Bush's

budget sought to cut the Maternal and Child Health Block Grants that provide

health care to women before, during and after pregnancy, and to freeze the

Healthy Start program, which has been shown to reduce infant mortality and

morbidity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ultraconservatives haven't had enough success in Congress with the

fetal-rights strategy for restricting abortion, so the White House has

taken up

their cause,&quot; Gandy explained. The U.S. House of Representatives recently

passed the so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which also sought to

grant

legal personhood to a fetus -- refusing amendments that would protect pregnant

women without a personhood requirement. The Senate has not yet taken up that

bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Endowing a fetus with more rights than a pregnant woman is more than a back

door attempt to restrict abortion rights,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;It's also a slap in

the

face to women everywhere.&quot;
