- November 13 -  Under the leadership of the Africa Group, a bloc of more

than 80 countries representing a majority of WTO Member States forced

concessions from rich countries on the controversial issue of public

health and drug company patent rights, despite fierce pressure from

the U.S., E.U., Japan and Switzerland to divide the countries.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such concessions include the statement &quot;Each Member has the right to

grant compulsory licenses and the freedom to determine the grounds upon

which such licenses are granted.&quot; This statement permits a country to

produce and import generic versions of drugs patented in the country

issuing the license.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the declaration that emerged on public health and TRIPS from

three days of negotiations was robbed of its full potential,

activists say.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Developing countries came to Doha to extract a clear declaration that

public health and access to medicines are more important than

protecting the commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies,&quot; said

Asia Russell of Health GAP Coalition. &quot;At the end of the day, opposition

from rich countries crippled the legally binding language sought by the

majority of WTO countries.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This pressure also stripped the declaration of resolution on the key

issue of how poor countries that have no capacity for production of

cheap generic drugs will secure access to recent and future essential

treatments. These treatments, that are or will be patent protected in

countries with significant domestic generic industry like Brazil and

India, could be exported to the poorest countries. Due to opposition

from rich countries, the Doha meeting did not provide any guarantee

that such actions are permitted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wealthy countries and drug companies refuse to compromise patent

monopolies in poor countries that have no domestic capacity. The

declaration does nothing to remedy this barrier. The majority of

people with AIDS and other treatable diseases live in these countries,

so a solution is critical,&quot; said Gaelle Krikorian of ACT UP Paris.

&quot;The Ministerial Declaration merely acknowledges the problem of

exporting drugs to poor countries&#139;rich countries stood in the way

of taking the actions that are desperately needed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Developing countries were seeking protection from rich-country

sanctions and other pressures in response to domestic measures,

such as compulsory licensing, that break patent monopolies on AIDS

medicines and other essential drugs. &quot;Countries levying formal or

informal pressure on poor countries that are taking strides to

increase drug access should face condemnation from WTO members,

because such pressure violates the spirit and terms of this agreement,&quot;

said Sharonann Lynch of Health GAP Coalition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Doha did not end the battle over poor country access to drugs,&quot;

Lynch continued. &quot;Against the pressure of rich countries and drug

companies, the fight must continue to complete the unfinished work

of this Ministerial&#139;millions of lives are at stake. We demand that

the WTO clarify during the first meeting of the TRIPS Council that

nothing in the TRIPS Agreement should stand in the way of countries

exporting cheap drugs to poor countries.&quot;</font></p>
