- March 1 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force announced today it is joining a broad coalition of progressive groups that is organizing in opposition to George W. Bush’s plan. Coalition members run the gamut of progressive causes, including social justice, children’s welfare, civil rights, the elderly, people with disabilities, feminists, labor, people of color groups and economic justice proponents.

<P>

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (see below), one in three families will not receive any tax cut whatsoever, while the most affluent one percent will receive an average windfall just under $45,000/year or $120/day. That is about three times what a minimum wage worker is paid for an 8-hour day.

<P>

“As part of our commitment to a broad racial and economic justice agenda, we join our progressive colleagues in opposition to this tax plan,” said NGLTF Executive Director Elizabeth Toledo. “This proposal benefits the most affluent at the expense of the rest of us. While Bush has yet to address the real needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered (GLBT) people, he has prioritized plans to line the pockets of those who need it the least and to shift public funds to religious schools and churches.”

<P>

NGLTF has been monitoring the proposed policies of George W. Bush on issues important to GLBT people. To visit NGLTF’s “W Watch” go to <a href="http://www.ngltf.org/federal/wwatch.htm">http://www.ngltf.org/federal/wwatch.htm</a>.
