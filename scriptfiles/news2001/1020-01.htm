- October 20 - Free Speech Radio News (FSRN) says that with hundreds of 

Afghani citizens killed in the first weeks of U.S./British-led 

bombing, it has positioned reporters across the Middle East and South 

Asia to cover this potentially global conflict--much of which is not 

accurately reported in the corporate press.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flying routinely under government censors, and anchored by former 

Pacifica Network News veteran Verna Avery Brown, the newscast 

challenges the information blackout sweeping the mainstream media 

with a pool of over 100 progressive journalists around the 

world--filing from every continent except Antarctica.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a climate of increasing political repression, FSRN is one of the 

few remaining independent sources for real information about the U.S. 

government's so-called war against terrorism--information not owned 

by a corporation, controlled by the Pentagon or vetted by the White 

House.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This daily, ground-breaking, half-hour newscast, airing on more than 

50 community radio stations, over the Internet and beamed to 120 

countries via short-wave, is proud to bring you:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fariba Nawa in Islamabad, providing first-hand accounts of U.S. air 

strikes, plus coverage of the Pakistani refugee crisis.

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeremy Scahill, the youngest-ever Polk Award winner offering 

critical analysis of the political alliances being sought by the U.S.

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sputnik Kilambi reporting from South Asia, with deep contacts among 

Indian and Pakistani peace activists.

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Smoot on the ground in Istanbul, reporting on violent police 

repression of civilian protest.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other international coverage includes Rafael Krafft in Occupied 

Palestine; Steve Negus in Egypt; Rory Mulholland in Turkminestan; 

Rupert Cook in the Sudan and Sam Olukoya in Nigeria.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kata Mester on Capitol Hill covers the clampdown on civil liberties. 

An impressive pool of journalists, including Polk-Award winner Robert 

Knight, Geoff Brady, Miranda Kennedy and Eileen Sutton bring daily 

news from "the first ground zero" in New York. Susan Wood weighs in 

from the United Nations, while FSRN is also  keenly focused on the 

U.S. peace movement and other domestic issues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This daily newscast is breaking new ground with fresh, tough-minded 

reportage," said media critique and syndicated columnist Norman 

Solomon.  "Born out of the censorship of Pacifica's top managers, 

Free Speech Radio News shows that radio still has a chance to live up 

to its potential as a source of news and views connecting 

people--from the grassroots--across the country and around the world."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FSRN, which supporters say features the best of progressive reporting 

from around the country and around the world, is twenty months old 

and was first created by dozens of freelance reporters who struck 

Pacifica Network News (PNN) last year over rampant censorship.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Critics say PNN has long-abandoned its progressive mission in tone 

and content, often sounding indistinguishable from mainstream media. 

Most of the stations carrying FSRN are Pacifica affiliates, and most 

have cancelled PNN. (For a list of those stations, see <a href="http://www.fsrn.org" target="_new">www.fsrn.org</a>.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FSRN will continue to uplink to a satellite at 5:00 p.m., Eastern 

Time, at coordinates A72.7M [b67.4].  MP3 and Real Audio files are 

posted to the strikers' web site daily at <a href="http://www.fsrn.org" target="_new">www.fsrn.org</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FSRN is produced in Washington D.C., San Francisco and Tampa. Aaron 

Glantz produces the cast, Randi Zimmerman is Headlines Editor. FSRN 

also receives critical production support from the Independent Media 

Center in New York (<a href="http://www.nyc.indymedia.org" target="_new">http://www.nyc.indymedia.org</a>) and community 

station WMNF in Florida.
