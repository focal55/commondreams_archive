- March 6 - Taxpayer subsidies for logging on National Forests 

                      are at an all-time high, according to a report released 

                      this morning by the United States Forest Service (USFS).</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Money 

                      doesn't grow on trees, but in this case it may,&quot; said 

                      Jonathan Oppenheimer, Program Director at Taxpayers for 

                      Common Sense. &quot;This report makes clear that timber 

                      companies have squandered millions of taxpayer dollars with 

                      federally-subsidized, inefficient logging practices.&quot; 

                      </font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

                      1997, the Forest Service reported a loss of $88 million. 

                      According to today's report, Timber Sale Program Information 

                      and Reporting System (TSPIRS), the Forest Service lost $126 

                      million as a result of money-losing logging operations in 

                      the national forests. The USFS's timber sale program generated 

                      $546 million in FY1998, but the program cost $672 million 

                      to operate. The loss equals a $2,200 subsidy per timber 

                      job.</font></p>

                    <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This 

                      free lunch for the timber industry must end. This is a clear-cut 

                      case of corporate welfare,&quot; continued Oppenheimer.</font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 

                      providing timber to private logging companies at a substantial 

                      loss, the Forest Service wastes millions of taxpayer dollars 

                      every year. General Accounting Office (GAO) reports have 

                      estimated the losses to be much higher than the USFS figure 

                      - approximately $2 billion between 1992-1997.</font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

                      annual TSPIRS report is supposed to be prepared by May of 

                      the following year, but the Forest Service has continually 

                      pushed the release date further back. This year, the Forest 

                      Service delayed more than 29 months before they publicly 

                      released the findings of the 1998 TSPIRS report. </font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 

                      postponing the release of report, the Forest Service had 

                      the opportunity to massage numbers to create the most politically 

                      benign report possible, according to Oppenheimer.</font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 

                      though the amount of timber harvested from National Forests 

                      has decreased significantly in the past decade, Congress 

                      continues to increase funding for the timber program. The 

                      GAO and the Forest Service recognize the increased losses 

                      from timber sales, yet Congress seems unwilling to respond. 

                      </font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

                      years past, amendments have been offered in both the House 

                      and the Senate to reduce subsidies for logging and logging 

                      road construction. Last year a bi-partisan amendment sponsored 

                      by Senator Richard Bryan (D-NV) and Senator Peter Fitzgerald 



                      (R-IL) lost by a margin of 45-54.</font></p>

                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If 

                      the President is serious about reducing corporate welfare, 

                      he can start by taking an ax to timber subsidies,&quot; 

                      concluded Oppenheimer.
