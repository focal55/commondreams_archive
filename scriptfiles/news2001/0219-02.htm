- February 19 - In a move that is widely viewed as an attack on First Amendment

rights on the Internet, Pacifica Foundation has said it will sue to force two groups

embroiled in a controversy over the radio network to dismantle Web sites critical of

Pacifica.

<p>A lawyer representing Pacifica sent letters last week to Friends of Free Speech Radio

in California and WBAI Listener Network in New York, demanding that the two groups abandon

the use of their domain names and relinquish all rights to those names by today, Feb. 19,

or face legal action. Pacifica is claiming that the groups, which operate <a href="http://www.savepacifica.net">www.savepacifica.net</a> and <a href="http://www.WBAI.net">www.WBAI.net</a>, are violating trademark laws.</p>



<p>Representatives of the two groups have said they will not dismantle the sites. Public

Citizen, which champions First Amendment rights on the Internet, will represent the groups

if Pacifica sues, as expected. A Pacifica attorney has told Public Citizen that it will

indeed go to court.</p>



<p>&quot;We cannot sit by idly while corporations try to silence people using illegal

intimidation tactics,&quot; Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook said. &quot;The law is

quite clear about First Amendment rights, which apply on the Internet as much as in

traditional forms of print.&quot;</p>



<p>The controversy stems from a conflict between Pacifica&#146;s management and station

employees and members over the network&#146;s future. Management is viewed as seeking to

sacrifice programming for profits, while employees and many community activists say they

don&#146;t want to give up the progressive programming for which Pacifica is noted.</p>



<p>In its Feb. 14 letters, Pacifica Foundation attorney Tanya Vanderbilt, of Epstein

Becker &amp; Green, P.C. in Washington, D.C., claims that the use of the Web site domain

names is a trademark infringement, could confuse people who go to the Web to look for

Pacifica&#146;s site and restricts Pacifica from conducting business on the Internet under

its own name.</p>



<p>But Paul Alan Levy, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group who has

represented people in several similar cases, said Pacifica&#146;s threats would not hold

up in court. Trademark infringement occurs when a company&#146;s name is used in a

misleading way to profit from consumer confusion about whether the company has sponsored

the message, he said. This clearly didn&#146;t apply in this case, because both sites are

clearly non-commercial, he said.</p>



<p>&quot;The First Amendment fully supports the kind of speech that is posted on these Web

sites,&quot; Levy said. &quot;It&#146;s unbelievable that Pacifica has to resort to

bullying tactics, rather than addressing the internal problems that have led to this

dissension.&quot;</p>

<p>Said Friends of Free Speech Radio member Robbie Osman, &quot;Savepacifica.net

and wbai.net are legal and valuable Web sites. They offer information about the actions of

the present Pacifica board. They make no pretense to being anything else.&quot; He added

that &quot;Pacifica historically has defended free expression and encouraged fair and open

debate. We must not allow it to descend into thuggishness and censorship.&quot;</p>



<p>Patty Heffley of WBAI Listener network said, &quot;Pacifica is trying to stifle free

speech on their own broadcast network and now in some Orwellian fashion they are trying to

silence those who listen as well.&quot;</p>



<p>In a similar recent case, Public Citizen represented an airline passenger who was so

upset about how Alitalia handled his lost luggage complaint that he launched a Web site

entitled <a href="http://www.alitaliasucks.com">www.alitaliasucks.com</a>. The airline sued for trademark infringement, among other

things, but dropped the suit shortly after a judge demanded that a top company official,

such as the president, come to court to explain why the company brought the case.
