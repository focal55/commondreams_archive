- June 20 - Students for a

Drug-Free White House today launched its first radio ad campaign to

support its "JustSayBlow.com" online petition effort. The ad will

begin airing this week in selected markets, including Coke, Texas;

Powderhorn, Colo.; and Blowville, Ohio. It was also emailed to more

than 6,000 JustSayBlow petition supporters today, and is posted for

listening and downloading at <a href="http://www.JustSayBlow.com/radio/" target="new">http://www.JustSayBlow.com/radio/</a>.

CD's are available for college stations and others who wish to air

it as a public service announcement.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group is combating a Bush Administration policy denying aid

to students who refuse to answer questions about past drug

convictions -- a policy that will rescind aid to 60,000 students

this year alone. The petition is posted at <a href="http://www.JustSayBlow.com" target="new">www.JustSayBlow.com</a>,

and

reads: "President Bush, if you deny federal funds to students who

won't talk about their drug histories, it's only fair that you

forego your federal salary until you are willing to come clean with

your own drug past."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Launched on May 22, the petition has already garnered nearly

6,000 signatures.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're on a shoestring budget, and we're guessing there's an

excellent chance we'll all get IRS audits next year, so we had to

be very strategic about paying to place the ad," said John Hlinko,

former Internet executive, <a href="http://www.MoveOn.org" target="new">MoveOn.org</a>

strategist, and founder/czar

of the group. "Coke, Blowville, Powderhorn... somehow, we just felt

that this issue would resonate particularly well in those places.

'Bush' and 'Coke' -- they just go together."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hlinko first stumbled upon the policy while researching Ph.D.

programs. Dazzled by the awe-inspiring hypocrisy of the program ("A

triumph! If hypocrisy were an Olympic event, even the East German

judge would've given this a 9.8") and stunned by the raw stupidity

of it ("If you want to keep a kid off drugs, why would you deny

them an education? How many crack dealers do you know with college

degrees?"), Hlinko posted the site, emailed a few friends, and

watched the numbers grow by "word of mouse."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"JustSayBlow.com is an excellent example of how citizens can use

the power of the Internet to highlight hypocrisy in our

government," said Joan Blades, co-founder of MoveOn.org, the most

successful online petition in Internet history. "John Hlinko

stepped forward to help us at MoveOn.org when we were just getting

going. He has been an inspiration, bringing a creative and humorous

approach to our strategic efforts. He understands viral marketing

better than anyone I know. I look forward to watching his work

progress with JustSayBlow.com."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fundraising: "Send Dubya a Mystery Mirror" Campaign

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group also began actively raising money to air the ad in

additional markets, and to produce more ads -- including television

spots. Supporters can donate online, at <a href="http://www.JustSayBlow.com" target="new">www.JustSayBlow.com</a>. Those

giving more than $25 will be rewarded with a "Commemorative

JustSayBlow.com" mirror (complete with mysterious white powder

residue). And, $50 donors will have the option of sending an

additional mirror to the president as a gift.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About the Policy: 60,000 Students Losing Aid, But Charles Manson

Still Qualifies

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Higher Education ACT (HEA) was initially passed to help

expand opportunities for Americans to attend college. However, it

was amended in 1998 by Congress to deny financial aid to students

with prior drug convictions. This provision was largely unenforced

by the Clinton Administration, but the Bush Administration has

decided to enforce it strictly -- even assuming that students who

do not answer the question are guilty. As a result, 60,000

students will lose their aid this year alone. Oddly enough, the

provision only applies to drug offenses -- murderers, rapists and

arsonists still qualify for aid. So, Charles Manson still gets aid

-- unless he's caught with a joint. Additionally, DWI is OK, so the

president and vice president need not worry.
