- January 31 - Statement of NOW President Patricia Ireland

        

Why are we making this fight to stop confirmation of John Ashcroft as attorney

general of the United States? This fight is about stopping the savaging of

everything we've worked for; this is about saving our rights and

constitutional

protections.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list of problems with this nomination is long and no secret to anyone.

Despite reports to the contrary, Ashcroft did not pledge not to try to reverse

Roe v. Wade; but reproductive rights are not our only concern.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ashcroft is soft on equal rights, civil rights, voting rights, separation of

church and state, the rights of free speech and to petition the government. He

has abused his power and refused to answer charges of misusing public

resources

for private political purposes. He has demeaned and slandered others to

advance

his career.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some commentators have confidently deemed our campaign a &quot;shot across the

bow,&quot;

or a &quot;you-ain't-seen-nothing-yet&quot; warning of the real fight we will wage over

ultra-conservative Supreme Court nominees. Others see this as a

continuation of

the presidential election, &quot;payback&quot; for Florida. Partisans have even

cynically

projected that our efforts are nothing more than a money-making machine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certainly we want the Bush administration and the senators to understand how

determined we are, and how much support we can mobilize, to save the court

from

nominees who would roll back constitutional protection of our rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, the election and the voting-rights fight give us a ready-made network of

angry, experienced and organized activists who are committed to stopping

Ashcroft. NOW's resources are going to tap into this network to generate

constituent contacts with senators, not into dialing-for-dollars to pay for

the

Stop Ashcroft campaign. But those effects are secondary to our real purpose

and

are thrown up as a smoke-screen by Ashcroft's supporters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ashcroft's record is well-established and clear: his priorities lie with his

own political and personal agenda, not with equal justice for all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every senator, Republican as well as Democrat, must consider this record and

decide whether Ashcroft can be trusted to hold the scales of justice in his

hand.
