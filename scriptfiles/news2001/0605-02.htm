- June 5 - Today, World

Environment Day, the United Nations, scientific groups,

governments, foundations, and other international agencies,

launched the most extensive study of the state of the world's

ecosystems.

<p>Called the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), it will examine

the processes that support life on earth like the world's

grasslands, forests, rivers and lakes, farmlands, and oceans. The

$21 million, four-year effort will involve 1,500 of the world's

leading scientists.

<p>"The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment will map the health of our

planet, and so fill important gaps in the knowledge that we need to

preserve it," said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in launching the

study. "All of us have to share the Earth's fragile ecosystems and

precious resources, and each of us has to play a role in preserving

them. If we are to go on living together on this earth, we must all

be responsible for it."

<p>The study was launched to provide decision-makers with

authoritative scientific knowledge concerning the impact of changes

to the world's ecosystems on human livelihoods and the environment.

It will provide governments, the private sector, and local

organizations with better information about steps that can be taken

to restore the productivity of the world's ecosystems.

<p>Pilot studies conducted by the World Resources Institute (WRI)

indicate that in many regions of the world, the capacity of

ecosystems to meet human needs for food and clean water is being

diminished. Also, threats to biodiversity and human health are

growing, and vulnerability to environmental disasters such as

floods and landslides is increasing.

<p>"All countries depend on ecosystem services to sustain their

populations," said Mohamed T. El-Ashry, chief executive officer of

the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a primary funder of the

project. "When these services are damaged, it can have wide-ranging

repercussions on the development prospects of affected nations,

with the most serious impacts on the poor. The Millennium Ecosystem

Assessment will be a powerful tool in helping us mitigate and even

reverse negative environmental trends and will strengthen our

ability to foster truly sustainable development."

<p>The MA was designed over the past three years by the UN

Development Programme, UN Environment Programme, the World Bank,

the World Resources Institute, and other partners. During this

period, WRI and its partners undertook a study -- the Pilot

Analysis of Global Ecosystems (PAGE) -- to demonstrate the

feasibility of the MA. The results were published in a five-volume

series over the past six months.

<p>"Ecosystems have a dual role of providing materials and services

to meet human needs for food, water, employment, and health, as

well as functioning to regulate environmental conditions and

quality that make the Earth habitable for humans and other

species," said Angela Cropper, co-chair of the Assessment Panel of

the MA. "The MA seeks to increase scientific understanding of how

their capacity to do so is being affected, and to help

policy-makers assess likely long-term consequences for ecosystems

and societies of the decisions they make."

<p>The MA will include global, sub-global, and national

assessments. Already, assessments are in the works for Southern

Africa, Southeast Asia, Central America, Western China, and

Norway. At the local level, studies are going on in India and

Sweden. More sub-global assessments will be added in the next few

months.

<p>"Assessing the state of a tightly inter-woven planet requires

unprecedented global cooperation," said Timothy E. Wirth, president

of the United Nations Foundation, one of the sponsors of the study.

"It demands new partnerships that meld authoritative scientific

expertise with the strengths of the private sector and the

dedicated service of public officials."

<p>The MA has been recognized by governments as a mechanism to meet

the assessment needs of three international environmental treaties

-- the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the Ramsar Convention

on Wetlands, and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.

<p>"The impact of the MA will stem from its scientific authority

and its political legitimacy," said Dr. Hamdallah Zedan, executive

secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. "It will

involve the largest number of natural and social scientists ever

assembled to look at the consequences of changes to the world's

ecosystems."

<p>The MA's work is overseen by a 40-member board, chaired by Dr.

Robert Watson, chief scientist of the World Bank and Dr. A. H.

Zakri, director of the United Nations University's Institute of

Advanced Studies. The Assessment Panel, which will oversee the

technical work of the MA, is comprised of 14 of the world's leading

social and natural scientists. It is co-chaired by Cropper and

Dr. Harold Mooney of Stanford University.

<p>"We have the unprecedented ability to change the vital systems

of our planet, for better or worse," said Jonathan Lash, WRI

president. "To change them for the better, we must recognize that

the well-being of people and ecosystems is interwoven and that the

fabric is fraying. We need to repair it, and we have the tools at

hand to do so."
