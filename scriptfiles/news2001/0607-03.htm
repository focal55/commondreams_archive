- June 7 - Chances for eliminating North Korea's development and export of ballistic

missiles and controlling its nuclear program improved considerably

yesterday after President Bush announced that the U.S. would resume

wide-ranging negotiations with Pyongyang. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President made the right decision,&quot; said Steve LaMontagne, a

specialist on nonproliferation at Council for a Livable World Education

Fund. &quot;Quiet diplomacy is the most effective and least costly way to stop

nuclear and missile proliferation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement comes after three months of tense verbal sparring between

North Korea and the new administration. In a major foreign policy misstep,

President Bush told South Korean president Kim Dae Jung last March that the

U.S. had no intention of resuming negotiations with Pyongyang anytime soon,

only a day after Secretary of State Colin Powell told reporters that the

U.S. would pick up where the Clinton administration left off in engaging

North Korea. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the ensuing weeks, North Korea threatened several times to end its

voluntary moratorium on ballistic missile tests as well as to pull out of

the 1994 Agreed Framework under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its

nuclear program in exchange for two light-water nuclear reactors and annual

deliveries of heavy fuel oil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the resumption of negotiations, the U.S. may now be able to complete

an agreement with Pyongyang that would limit its missile activities, which

have been the main justification for quick deployment of a costly and

controversial U.S. anti-missile system.  If such an agreement is reached,

the pressure for early deployment will diminish substantially.  Negotiations 

will also provide a forum for the U.S. to address its concerns about the

verification of nuclear and missile agreements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration may be starting to realize that there's not going to be

any workable or affordable missile defense anytime soon,&quot; said John Isaacs,

President of Council for a Livable World. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The best option for dealing with North Korea is to talk to them,&quot; added

Isaacs. </font></p>
