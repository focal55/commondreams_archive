<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- June 22 - Six students stood trial from June 20 to June 22, 2001 in Washington DC for a nonviolent demonstration against the Sikorsky Corporation,

manufacturer of the Black Hawk helicopter. The six students, all from

Oberlin College, locked themselves around a pillar inside the Sikorsky

Corporation's conference at the National Guard Memorial Museum on April 2,

2001 to protest the $221 million profit Sikorsky is making off the &quot;War on

Drugs&quot; in Colombia.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The six students are Jackie Downing, 21, Sarah Bania-Dobyns, 22, Kate

Berrigan, 19, Rebecca Johnson, 21, Laurel Paget-Seekins, 21, and Sarah

Saunders, 20.  They defended themselves, arguing that they acted out of an

international tradition of a nonviolent civil disobedience to raise public

awareness and change policy.  The students argued that they had a right

and an obligation to speak the truth to the officials of the Sikorsky

Corporation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the trial, two of the students, Sarah Saunders of Lake Orion, MI and

Jackie Downing of Topsfield, MA, testified about the violence and

poisoning of food crops in Colombia, both consequences of the U.S.-funded&quot;War or Drugs&quot; that they witnessed while visiting Colombia in January

2001.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sikorsky Corporation is supplying 30 Black Hawk helicopters to the

Colombian military as part of Plan Colombia. In addition to accompanying

fumigation planes, the helicopters are used to fly American and Colombian

soldiers into direct combat. &quot;These helicopters are not being used for

peaceful purposes, as Sikorsky claims,&quot; said Kate Berrigan. &quot;We believe

that helicopters and military aid will not bring an end to the 40-year civil war or the drug trade in Colombia.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After an hour and a half of deliberations, the jury returned with a

verdict of guilty. Judge Mitchell-Rankin subsequently dismissed the jury

before proceeding to sentencing.  The District Attorney asked the judge

for a sentence of three days, insisting that the six women would clearly

not comply with probation.  Instead the judge sentenced them to a $75

fine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Although an acquittal would have been a great victory for us and for the

movement, we win on either count,&quot; states Sarah Bania-Dobyns of Denver,

CO.  &quot;The courtroom was filled with supporters and several major

newspapers covered the trial.  We raised a lot of awareness today about

what the U.S. government and corporations are doing in Colombia and we

will continue to do so.&quot;</font></p>
