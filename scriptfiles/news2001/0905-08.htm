- September 5 - Yesterday, the Violence Policy Center (VPC), a national 

        non-profit educational organization working to stop gun death and injury 

        in America, joined by Legal Community Against Violence and Physicians 

        for Social Responsibility, <a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/niccont.htm" target="_new">submitted 

        formal comments</a> to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opposing 

        Attorney General John Ashcroft's proposed rule which would dramatically 

        impair the Brady Law's National Instant Criminal Background Check System 

        (NICS) by requiring virtually immediate destruction of the vast majority 

        of records in the system. The retention of these records for a reasonable 

        period of time is necessary to protect the privacy and security of the 

        system. Without a reasonable retention period, there is no way to identify 

        felons who defraud the background check system by using fake identification, 

        domestic abusers who force their partners to buy guns for them, or bad-apple 

        dealers who run background checks on neighbors or others who are not buying 

        guns. 

      </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its comments, the VPC points out that the proposed rule is the "fruit 

        of a poisonous tree" because it is a byproduct of an an illegal suspension 

        by Ashcroft of a final rule, developed during the Clinton Administration. 

        The Clinton rule would have allowed law enforcement to retain records 

        of approved gun sales for audit purposes for 90 days. The proposal to 

        require near-immediate destruction emerged after Ashcroft postponed the 

        implementation of the 90-day rule, considered cutting the time to 45 days, 

        and then, at the last minute, cut the time for retention down to a maximum 

        of 24 hours. Just three days before Ashcroft announced his proposal, the 

        U.S. Supreme Court rejected once and for all the National Rifle Association's 

        legal challenge to the FBI's authority to retain records for audit purposes. 

        Paradoxically, the Ashcroft Justice Department actually argued for such 

        a ruling before in the Supreme Court.

      </font>

<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For Attorney General Ashcroft to advocate the near-immediate destruction 

        of all records of approved gun sales just three days after the U.S. Supreme 

        Court told him that the audit log was perfectly legal is proof positive 

        that the NRA is calling the shots at the Justice Department," said Mathew 

        Nosanchuk, VPC litigation director and legislative counsel. "What the 

        NRA could not get from the courts, Attorney General Ashcroft has handed 

        the gun lobby on a silver platter."
