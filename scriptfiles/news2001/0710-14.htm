- July 10 - Greens and Green Parties in

the United States and around the world have

christened Wednesday, July 11 as a &quot;National Day

of Action&quot; to urge the boycott of major oil

companies initiated at the Global Greens 2001

conference held in Canberra, Australia in mid

April. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actions will take place on Wednesday in major

American cities and at least 15 countries,

leading up to next week's planned Kyoto

negotiations in Bonn, Germany.  Lists of

confirmed U.S. events can be read at the

following web sites:

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Representatives of Green Parties from 80 nations

voted unanimously in favor of a worldwide boycott

of Exxon Mobil (Esso), Texaco, and Chevron in

order to pressure the George W. Bush

Administration into signing back on to the Kyoto

Treaty,&quot; said [Annie Goeke, co-chair of the

Association of State Green Parties and a member

of ASGP's International Committee].  &quot;Greens call

Kyoto a minimal but necessary step to slow global

warming.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pressure Point, a Seattle-based nonprofit, leads

grassroots organizations promoting the boycott

and planning various actions, including street

theater, displays of signs and banners, and

rallies near corporate offices and gas stations. 

Pressure Point has focused on Exxon Mobil, which

it calls the worst of the &quot;Greenhouse Gangsters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exxon Mobil continues to fund greenhouse

skeptics, has spent millions on greenwash

advertisements, was a major corporate contributor

to Bush's election ($1.2 million to the

Republican Party), lobbied the U.S. government to

reject the Kyoto Protocol, lobbied for drilling

in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and

invests virtually nothing in renewable energy.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exxon Mobil leads corporations in support for

anti-democratic &quot;free trade&quot; pacts that hold the

power to override environmental, labor, and human

rights protections.  Exxon Mobil pushed for the

World Bank's destructive Chad/Cameroon pipeline

project, holds a record of violations against the

environment and human rights in Nigeria,

Colombia, and Russia, and refuses to reinstate a

non-discrimination policy covering sexual

orientation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Clinton Administration obstructed

implementation of the Kyoto measures in November,

2000, President Bush crushed worldwide hopes for

reducing global warming by withdrawing the U.S.

from the treaty.  Since the U.S., with 4% of the

world's population, produces 25% of the world's

greenhouse gas emissions, U.S. policies on

climate change have outraged the international

community.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About a hundred members of the European

Parliament have signed the boycott petition (see

&lt;<a href="http://www.europarl.ep.ec/greens-efa" target="new">http://www.europarl.ep.ec/greens-efa</a>&gt;); many

will participate in public rallies and other

events in Europe to urge the public to boycott

Exxon Mobil, Texaco, and Chevron.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens stress the need for rapid conversion from

fossil fuels to solar and wind power and other

forms of clean, efficient, and mostly low-cost

alternative sources of energy.  &quot;If Exxon owned

the sun, we'd have solar energy tomorrow,&quot; Green

Party candidate Ralph Nader said during his 2000

campaign for the White House.</font></p>
