<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- December 17 - </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"So long as lawmakers are beholden to monied interests, the legislative process will be compromised. … Seven more signatures on the discharge petition would clear the way for cleaner elections." 

        <BR>

</i>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- San Diego Union Tribune, November 25, 2001

 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two hundred ten members of Congress have asked to schedule a vote on the campaign finance reform measure sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA).  Seven of the rest can step up and make that happen.  Although similar legislation, the McCain-Feingold bill, passed the Senate in April, campaign finance reform remains a major item of unfinished business as the House recesses for the year.  And as Representative Shays has observed, political fundraising has resumed, and so should the fight to reduce the influence of money in politics.  

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As House action on Election Reform legislation shows, reforms to strengthen our democracy fit naturally into the House's agenda during this national crisis.  The House should take up the Shays-Meehan bill as early as possible when it reconvenes in January.  Seven members of Congress can make that happen," Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.

</font>

<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As the parties have resumed soft money fundraising and big money contributors seek to profiteer from war and recession, we need more than ever to reduce the influence of big money on national policy.  Congress can and must find the time to reduce the influence of big money and give Americans confidence that their government is making decisions in the national interest," Harshbarger said. 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Shays-Meehan bill has actually passed the House twice before, in 1998 and in 1999, but each of those times the legislation was blocked by a filibuster in the Senate.  When the Senate finally passed McCain-Feingold in April of this year, reform opponents in the House, led by Minority Whip Tom DeLay (R-TX), refused to schedule a vote under fair rules.  When the leadership's unfair plan came up for a vote in June, it was soundly defeated, signaling broad, bipartisan support for Shays-Meehan.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As of December 12, reform supporters have 210 out of the 218 signatures necessary for the discharge petition to come to fruition, and have the commitment of another Representative to be the 218th.  Newly-elected Representative Stephen Lynch (D-MA) became the most recent signatory on November 14.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proponents of campaign finance reform point to recent legislative action in Congress to illustrate why meaningful campaign finance reform is more important now than ever.  "The parties are actually raising more soft money contributions than ever before," Harshbarger said.  "And donors, regrettably, seem to be getting their money's worth.  Democracy itself needs a stimulus package, and campaign finance reform is a necessary first step."

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>BIG DONORS PROFITEERING IN TIME OF CRISIS</B>

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many big soft money donors are seeking to reap huge windfalls as Congress acts on so-called economic stimulus measures and other legislation.  "The business-as-usual attempts by big donors to benefit from our national crisis amount to war profiteering, and we ought to break the system that allows it," Harshbarger said. "True patriots would not attempt to use exceptional influence for their own special interest during this time of shared sacrifice."

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A discharge petition (formally called a &quot;Motion 

        to Discharge Committee&quot;) is a special procedure to bring legislation 

        directly to the House floor for consideration, bypassing the committee 

        process.&nbsp; It is used when the House leadership refuses to schedule 

        legislation for floor consideration or when a committee refuses to report 

        legislation to the full House.</font>

<p>

      

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The petition itself is kept in House chamber 

        by the Clerk of the House and may be signed whenever the House is in session.&nbsp; 

        Once 218 Members have signed, a process is begun which brings the legislation 

        to the floor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 1998 and in 1999, the House GOP leadership 

        backed down and scheduled debate on campaign finance reform when it became 

        apparent that reform supporters were on the verge of collecting the requisite 

        signatures.&nbsp; Both times, the House passed the Shays-Meehan bill with 

        broad bipartisan support.&nbsp; </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protracted fight over economic stimulus legislation has been prolonged by provisions that appear to reward some of the parties' most generous campaign donors.  The fight over pieces of the pie has delayed economic stimulus at a time when the United States confronts recession as well as war.  Many of the largest corporations in American, for instance, have tried to include a retroactive repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) in the stimulus package, and it was included in the version passed by the House.  Now marketed as a boost to the sagging economy, repeal of the AMT is a special-interest perennial on Capitol Hill, because it would ensure that profitable corporations can escape all tax liability.

Just 14 corporations alone would get $6.3 billion of a retroactive rebate, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.  IBM alone would get $1.4 billion, followed by General Motors, receiving $833 million, and General Electric, $671 million. Over the past 10 years, the same 14 corporations gave nearly $15 million to the national party committees in huge soft money contributions.  

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In November, brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers sought and won extensions on their patents for medications, thereby preventing cheaper, generic versions of many drugs from coming to market.  Bayer, for instance, the maker of Cipro, stands to gain $358 million in additional sales.  Bayer has pumped more than $94,000 into party coffers in recent years.

"Respected voices like Paul Volcker and the Wall Street Journal doubt these tax breaks will stimulate the economy. There is room for disagreement over patent lengths," Harshbarger said.  "But big money donations make it more difficult to assure Americans that our representatives make these decisions in the public interest."

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>Soft Money:  Bad For Democracy</B>

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the core of the Shays-Meehan legislation is a ban on soft money.  The term 'soft money' refers to unlimited political donations from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals to the political parties, which in turn spend much of that money to aid federal candidates.   Because the contributions are laundered through the parties and pay for carefully worded advertisements without the words "elect" or "defeat," these contributions can come in unlimited amounts.  They can also come from sources that are ordinarily prohibited from giving to candidates, like corporations (prohibited from giving to federal candidates since 1907) and from union dues (prohibited since 1947).  

And although soft money contributions are disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, the parties' contribution-laundering makes it virtually impossible to follow the flow of this money from the solicitation to its ultimate destination.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The soft money system works just fine for special interests and party leadership," Harshbarger said.  "But ordinary people - and even rank-and-file members of Congress - lose influence over their government.  The system invites cynicism and mistrust.  Breaking the system which gives special access and influence to big money will restore confidence in government at a time when it's needed most."



</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a recent Common Cause analysis, the national party committees have raised a record $98.8 million in soft money in the first six months of the 2001-2001 election cycle, with Democrats raising $33.3 million and Republicans raising $65.6 million.  The securities and investments sector led the way giving more than $7 million, followed by the telecommunications industry ($6.4 million) and labor unions ($6.3 million).  So far, the parties are on track to exceed the pace even of the last presidential election cycle, when the parties raised more than $463 million in soft money.
