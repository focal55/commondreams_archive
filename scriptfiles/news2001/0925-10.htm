- September 25 - According to Census Bureau reports released today more than one out of ten 

Americans and one out of six children lived in poverty in 2000, at the height 

of the economic boom. Minimum Needs Budgets presented in RAISE THE FLOOR: 

WAGES AND POLICIES THAT WORK FOR ALL OF US, a new book published by the Ms. 

Foundation for Women, show that the Census Bureau poverty definition is out 

of date.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Millions of Americans above the poverty line live in households where paying 

the rent means going without health care and paying for child care means 

regularly skipping meals. American families need more than double the federal 

poverty threshold to make ends meet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal poverty thresholds were adopted in the 1960s using a poverty 

formula based on US Department of Agriculture estimates of the cost of a 

minimum family diet (now called the Thrifty Food Plan) multiplied by three 

because families spent about one-third of their income on food. The USDA 

warned that the plan was meant only for &quot;temporary or emergency use when 

funds are low&quot; and stressed that &quot;the cost of this plan is not a reasonable 

measure of basic money needs for a good diet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, food costs one-seventh of total average household expenditures, and 

one-sixth of expenditures for households in the lowest 20% of income--not 

one-third. The poverty thresholds are adjusted for inflation, but they have 

not been updated to reflect, for example, that basic needs such as housing 

and medical care costs have increased more rapidly than food costs. Just 

updating the multiplier to reflect current expenditures would double the 

official poverty threshold. Moreover, the official poverty measure ignores 

changes in family needs such as greater child care and transportation costs 

due to women's increased labor force participation, for example.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Minimum Needs Budgets presented in RAISE THE FLOOR, by Holly Sklar, 

Laryssa Mykyta and Susan Wefald, show what individuals and families need 

nationally to meet minimal housing, food, health care, child care, 

transportation, household and personal expenses, and pay federal, state and 

payroll taxes, factoring in tax credits such as the Earned Income Credit. The 

chart below compares the Census Bureau poverty thresholds with the Minimum 

Needs Budgets (updated to 2000) for working households who do not have 

employment-based health insurance, which is the reality for most low-income 

households.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Household...............Minimum Needs Budget....Census Poverty Threshold<br>

Single adult.............$17,105.............................$8,959<br>

Two adult..................24,313..............................11,531<br>

1 parent, 1 child........29,764..............................11,869<br>

1 parent, 2 children...34,108..............................13,874<br>

2 parent, 1 child........32,306..............................13,861<br>

2 parent, 2 children...36,835..............................17,463</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most Americans believe that a full-time job should keep you out of poverty. 

But at $10,712 a year, a full-time minimum wage job keeps many Americans 

below the government's official poverty line and well below more realistic 

minimum needs budgets. A mom and dad with two children would have to work a 

combined 3.3 full-time minimum wage jobs to make ends meet. That's 132 hours 

a week. Minimum wage workers earn 35 percent less than their counterparts did 

in 1968--adjusting for inflation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time for us to adjust both the official poverty measure and the minimum 

wage to reflect today's cost of living,&quot; says Susan Wefald, coauthor of Raise 

The Floor and director of Institutional Planning at the Ms. Foundation. &quot;As 

we reassess government spending in the wake of the September 11 attacks and 

formulate an economic stimulus package, let's serve our national security 

needs while also addressing the economic insecurity hurting our poorest 

Americans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAISE THE FLOOR recommends raising the minimum wage to $8. That's what a 

single worker needs to meet their minimum needs working full time. That's 

what it takes just to match the minimum wage of 1968, adjusting for 

inflation. RAISE THE FLOOR spotlights businesses, large and small, that 

demonstrate how good wages are good business in good economic times and bad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RAISE THE FLOOR also shows how we can supplement a higher minimum wage with 

improved child care, health care, housing and Earned Income Tax Credit 

policies, and other practical measures to reduce poverty and its harmful 

consequences, and get our economy moving again.</font></p>
