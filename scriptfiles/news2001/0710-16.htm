- July 10 - A current report raises urgent new questions about

ExxonMobil violations of U.S. Federal law and its undermining of U.S.

foreign policy objectives. The report reveals how ExxonMobil's continued business relationship with the Indonesian military involves the

corporation in unlawful business practices and in human rights abuses.

Specifically: - financing Indonesian military and police acts of human rights abuse,

drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, &amp; extortion.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This report, &quot;The Conflict in Aceh, and U.S. Interests in Promoting A

Free Market, Stability and Human Rights in South East Asia - An

Examination of the Context and Impacts of ExxonMobil&#146;s Security

Arrangements with the Indonesian Armed Forces&quot;, is available on the

website of the Harvard University Humanitarian Policy and Conflict

Studies Program at

<a href="http://preventconflict.org/portal/main/research/jereski.htm" target="new">http://preventconflict.org/portal/main/research/jereski.htm</a>. It was

prepared to encourage U.S. Congressional and Justice Department

investigations into the question of ExxonMobil's alleged violations of

U.S. law and its undermining of foreign policy goals. Congress has

severely restricted military aid and training for the Indonesian

military because of its widespread human rights abuses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On July 11th, the International Day of Action against ExxonMobil is to

be launched against the world's largest publicly held corporation with

over 100 protests in 15 countries scheduled (see <a href="http://www.PressurePoint.org" target="new">PressurePoint.org</a>).

Among the issues uniting the protestors is ExxonMobil's alleged

complicity in human rights atrocities in Aceh, Indonesia. The

demonstrations will also express support for the Kyoto Treaty on climate change, blocking moves to drill in the Arctic Refuge, and ending support for corporate controlled &quot;free&quot; trade.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report's author, Robert Jereski, was a colleague of the murdered

Acehnese human rights lawyer, Jafar Siddiq Hamzah, 35, a resident of New York. Hamzah was murdered in Indonesia in August 2000, while

investigating ExxonMobil's abuses in the resource rich province of Aceh.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jereski delivered copies of the report to New York Senators Charles

Schumer and Hilary Clinton and to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

The report urges Senate hearings and a Justice Department investigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 20, 2001, a lawsuit was filed against ExxonMobil by the

International Labor Rights Fund, in federal court in Washington, D.C.

The plaintiffs are 11 villagers living near ExxonMobil facilities in

Lhokseumawe, Aceh, who suffered a range of atrocities, including rapes,

torture and murdered spouses, allegedly at the hands of the military

hired by the energy giant as security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indications of corruption, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, surfaced with a 1999 PricewaterhouseCoopers &quot;Special Audit&quot; of

Pertamina, ExxonMobil's partner in natural gas operations in the

province of Aceh, Indonesia. This audit revealed widespread

&quot;inefficiencies&quot;, due to corruption, collusion and nepotism in Pertamina procurement transactions. According to the audit, there were $4.6

billion in losses. Since its formation in 1968 under the dictator

Suharto, Pertamina has been a major source of funding for the military.

ExxonMobil has neither disavowed their partner's activities nor

dissolved the partnership.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the International Crisis Group and other sources, the

Indonesian military raises as much as 75% of its operating budget from

legal and illegal business ventures. The report argues that the

military's drug running, arms trafficking and prostitution - including

child prostitution - contribute to regional instability, harm

democratization efforts as well as undermining the U.S. government's war on drugs. ExxonMobil hands over $6 million dollars a year to the

military, ostensibly for their security.
