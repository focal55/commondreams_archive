<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 

- April 20 - The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is moving to weaken or eliminate

two of the few remaining broadcasting rules that protect some degree of

media diversity. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 19, the FCC voted 3-1 in favor of eliminating the &quot;dual network&quot;

rule, which had prevented one television network from buying another.  This

rule change will immediately benefit Viacom, which will be allowed to own

CBS and part of the UPN network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other rule, expected to be lifted or amended in a matter of weeks, is

the &quot;cross ownership&quot; rule, which prohibits a company that owns a local

newspaper from owning a television station in the same market. Waivers have

been granted in the past (Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. owns New York

television station WNYW and the New York Post, for example), but watering

down or eliminating the rule altogether has long been a goal of industry

lobbyists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This continues an intensely pro-business trend at the FCC, the government

agency responsible for managing the broadcast spectrum and regulating the

telecommunications industry. Under the impetus of the deregulatory

Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC has overseen a period of intense

corporate mergers. Since the Telecom Act, the number of television station

owners in the U.S. has dropped by half (Los Angeles Times, 4/19/01), while

more than half of the 11,000 commercial radio stations have been sold

(Silicon Alley Reporter, 3/01).   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The move to deregulate the media industry continued three years later, as

the FCC in August 1999 changed its rules to allow networks to own two

television stations in a given market. And last month, FCC chair Michael

Powell approved a number of radio mergers that had been marked for public

comment by previous Chairman William Kennard (Broadcasting &amp; Cable,

3/19/01).  The mergers given the green light by Powell would  create local

monopolies, where one company would control 50 percent of a given market's

ad revenue, or two companies would control about 70 percent of total ad

revenue.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Powell has indicated (New York Times, 4/16/01) that the cross ownership rule

will fall as well: &quot;I don't know why there's something inherent about a

newspaper and something inherent about a broadcaster that means they can't

be combined.&quot; Given that U.S. newspapers are overwhelmingly local

monopolies, of course, mergers between the newspaper industry and the

increasingly concentrated broadcast media would mean a dramatic reduction in

media diversity at the local level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guarding and protecting the public interest is supposed to be central to the

FCC's mission, but Powell has expressed some confusion about the very

concept. When asked in February what he thought the term &quot;public interest&quot;

meant (press conference, 2/6/01), he responsed: &quot;I have no idea. The public

interest at its core is the same thing as my oath of office: a commitment to

making sure the American consumer is benefited.... I try to make the best

judgment I can in ways I think will benefit consumers. Beyond that I don't

know. I'm still trying to figure it out.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Powell is not always so confused about whose interests he represents:

Appearing before the House subcommittee on telecommunications (Washington

Post, 3/30/01), Powell referred to broadcast corporations as &quot;our clients.&quot;

Powell has also mocked the concept of unequal access to technology, often

referred to as the digital divide: &quot;I think there is a Mercedes divide,&quot; he

said (New York Times, 2/7/01). &quot;I'd like to have one; I can't afford one.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FCC's actions under Powell are discouraging for those who advocate for

media diversity. &quot;Powell has been very clear about his intentions to turn

over more and more of the publicly owned broadcast spectrum to already huge

media corporations. These moves reaffirm those corporate-friendly

principles,&quot; said Jim Naureckas of FAIR. &quot;The FCC's total lack of interest

in protecting Americans as citizens or consumers is shocking and

disgraceful.&quot;</font></p>
