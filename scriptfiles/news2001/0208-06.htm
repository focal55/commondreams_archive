- February 8 - Karamah: Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights and The

Interfaith Alliance Foundation (TIAF) will bring together religious

leaders and civil rights advocates for a roundtable discussion on

Capitol Hill to examine the increasing visibility and role of

Muslims in the American political process. Religious leaders and

civil rights advocates will also provide analysis of the civil

liberties concerns of the diverse Muslim community. The event

will be held Monday, Feb. 12 in Room 2105 of the Rayburn House

Office Building from 10 a.m. until noon.

<p>Cited as one of the fastest growing religious communities in the

nation, there are an estimated six million Muslims drawn from

various ethnic and racial communities living within the United

States. Increasingly, Muslims are cited by politicians and elected

leaders as contributing members of the religious landscape.

Despite this recognition, however, the actual treatment of Muslims

during the most recent election cycle continues to raise serious

questions about the impact of negative stereotypes on the

substantive participation of Muslims in American politics.

<p>When:

Monday, Feb. 12 at 10 a.m.

Continental breakfast provided

<p>Where:

Capitol Hill -- 2105 Rayburn House Office Building

<p>Who:

<br>-- Sharifa Alkhateeb, president, North American Council of

Muslim Women

<br>-- Asim Ghafoor, managing director, AG Consulting Group

<br>-- Rabbi Jack Moline, Agudas Achim Congregation of Northern

Virginia, board member of The Interfaith Alliance

<br>-- Laura Murphy, director, ACLU Washington Office
