<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 27  - &quot;As the fall congressional spending frenzy nears, sky-high 

budget surpluses have all but evaporated. The era of budget 

surpluses is over. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;According to Congressional Budget Office numbers to be 

released Tuesday morning, the non-Social Security budget surplus 

has turned into a $9 billion deficit for this year, while the 

off-budget surplus will be around $162 billion. As of April of 

this year, the non-Social Security surplus was more than 

$120 billion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Both Democrats and Republicans are to blame for this 

budgetary debacle. Rather than practice sound fiscal 

discipline, both parties would rather play a high stakes game of 

budgetary chicken. Members from both parties continue to break 

the bank with outrageous spending proposals while they blame 

each other for Washington's out-of-control spending. It is the 

ultimate passing of the buck... and those bucks belong to 

taxpayers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given the trend, it is likely that this year's budget 

deficit will balloon even more. The only way the Bush 

Administration will be able to control congressional spending 

will be to start vetoing Appropriations bills. While the 

Administration has had strong rhetoric regarding congressional 

spending, they risk further straining congressional relations if 

they start vetoing bills. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With budget deficits looming on the horizon, the Pentagon 

and other Washington special interests will be singing the 

budgetary blues. These new numbers will cast a long shadow over 

the Administration's request for $18 billion in new defense 

spending and its multibillion-dollar plan for a national missile 

defense system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It also puts the $38 billion in subsidies to big energy on 

life support. It's going to be a hard sell to the American 

taxpayer to spend even more money subsidizing profitable 

industries when other popular programs start feeling the fiscal 

squeeze.&quot; </font></p>
