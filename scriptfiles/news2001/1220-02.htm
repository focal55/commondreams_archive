<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- December 20 - A broad range of citizen 

organizations and leaders, spanning the political spectrum, has 

joined together to express outrage over a provision in the Defense 

Appropriations bill that would have the Air Force lease Boeing 767s 

at a price dramatically higher than the cost of direct purchase. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to senators, the groups urged senators &quot;to take to 

the floor to speak and vote against this specific siphoning of 

taxpayer money to the Boeing company.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signers of the letter included Ralph Nader, Grover Norquist, the 

Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, the Congressional 

Accountability Project, the National Taxpayers Union, the Project 

on Government Oversight, Public Citizen and Taxpayers for Common 

Sense. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Boeing lease provision, the Air Force will lease 100 

Boeing 767s for use as tankers, at a pricetag of $20 million per 

plane per year, over a 10-year period. This $20 billion expenditure 

is far higher than the cost of direct purchase. The government will 

accrue extra expenses because it will be obligated not only to 

convert the commercial aircraft to military configurations; when 

the 10-year lease is over, it will be required to convert them back 

to commercial format, at an estimated cost of $30 million apiece. 

The cost of the lease plan may be as much as five times higher than 

an outright purchase would be. A last-minute amendment would also 

have the Air Force lease four 737s to shuttle Defense Department 

officials and potentially congressional leaders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no conceivable rationale for such a waste of taxpayer 

resources,&quot; the groups said in their letter. &quot;If some in Congress 

believe Boeing needs to be subsidized, then they should propose 

direct subsidies to the company, and let Congress fully debate and 

vote on the issue before the American people, following 

comprehensive public hearings on the proposal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is not a partisan issue. It is a basic test of whether 

Congress views itself as fundamentally accountable to the public 

interest, both procedurally and substantively. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There will obviously be a Defense Appropriations bill passed 

for the coming fiscal year. But it must not be one that includes 

such a gross exhibition of corporate welfare. We urge you to speak 

and vote against the bill; and to force consideration of a revised 

bill, stripped of this grotesquery.&quot; </font></p>
