- January 16 - A strong coalition of 120 women's rights groups unite in

opposition to John Aschcroft's and Tommy Thompson's nominations.

"Women's organizations are justifiably outraged over Bush's

appointment of right-wing, anti-women's rights extremists," said

Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority. "Based on their

records, Ashcroft puts ideology over law and Thompson puts ideology

over health policy," added Smeal. "In both cases, women lose big."

<p>Many cast Ashcroft as extreme, while many cast Thompson as more

moderate. "Let there be no mistake about it, both Ashcoft and

Thompson want to criminalize abortion and make it a felony," said

Smeal. "Let us not forget that Thompson passed and signed into law

a measure so punitive and extreme that it mandated a lifetime

prison sentence for physicians who performed an abortion procedure

that he deemed late-term abortion," added Smeal. However, the

statute, ultimately declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme

Court, was written so vaguely it could have reached all abortions.

<p>Both Ashcroft and Thompson are supported and connected to

extreme right-wing figures such as Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell,

Phyllis Schlafly, Ralph Reed, Bob Jones and Jesse Helms. Both

Ashcroft and Thompson are connected to big tobacco. "When it comes

to tobacco and guns, both Thompson and Ashcroft argue for the right

to choose, but when it comes to a woman's right to choose, they

argue for criminal penalties," proclaimed Smeal.

<p>Both Ashcroft and Thompson have anti-women's rights records

outside the abortion issue. Ashcroft fought the Equal Rights

Amendment (ERA) and is fighting the Convention to Eliminate All

Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Ashcroft also has

an abysmal record of appointing women. He appointed not a single

woman to his initial Governor's cabinet, ranking dead last among

all 50 governors. Thompson has harshly penalized poor single

mothers with his so-called welfare reform which in actuality is

nothing more than welfare elimination.

<p>Both Ashcroft and Thompson have gutted and fought handgun

control laws, going so far as supporting laws that allow guns to be

carried in public. "Both are in the pocket of the NRA and not at

all sympathetic to the Million Mom March," said Smeal.

<p>"President-Elect Bush has nominated anti-women extremists to the

very cabinet positions that can hurt women's rights and women's

lives the most," said Smeal.
