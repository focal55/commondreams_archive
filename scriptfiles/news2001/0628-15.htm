- June 28 - Responding to reports 

that President Bush will ask Congress for funds to facilitate 

the deployment of rudimentary national missile defense (NMD) 

system by 2004, experts from an alliance of Washington-based 

nuclear arms control organizations warned that such a proposal 

would be vigorously opposed at home and abroad. They charged 

that it would decrease rather than increase national and 

international security because a crash NMD deployment will not 

provide an effective and reliable defense against long-range 

missile attack and will precipitate a counterproductive and 

unnecessary diplomatic showdown with European allies, as well as 

Russia and China. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration's scheme for deployment of a 

rudimentary missile defense by 2004 would provide only the 

illusion of protection from potential long-range missile 

threats. At the same time, such a 'scarecrow' missile defense 

would eventually violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and 

could set off a dangerous action reaction cycle, involving the 

United States, Russia, and China,&quot; said John B. Rhinelander of 

the Lawyers Alliance for World Security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The true purpose of such an action seems to be to shoot down 

the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty rather than incoming ballistic 

missiles. It reminds me of the poetry line, slightly rephrased, 

'I shot a missile in the air, and it came to earth I know not 

where -- except the Treaty was there,'&quot; said Rhinelander. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary 

of Defense Donald Rumsfeld outlined the Bush Administration's 

fiscal 2002 defense budget request proposed a substantial 

increase in spending on missile defenses. The Bush budget calls 

for fifty-seven percent more spending on missile defense, from 

$5.3 billion in fiscal 2001, to a proposed $8.3 billion for 

fiscal 2002. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Throwing money at missile defense in order to carry out a 

campaign pledge to deploy as soon as possible is a dangerous 

waste of money,&quot; argued Carlean Ponder of the Women's Action for 

New Directions, a Coalition member organization. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Secretary Rumsfeld said that the budget request does 

not contain funding for NMD deployment, the DoD budget request 

for fiscal 2002 would provide funds for a new anti-missile &quot;test 

bed&quot; in Alaska, which could serve as a prototype system. And, 

according to a report in today's edition of The Wall Street 

Journal, the Pentagon is readying a contract for construction of 

a ground-based NMD interceptor site at Fort Greeley in Alaska. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Construction could begin as soon as August if the President 

so orders. Legal opinions differ on when construction of the 

site would constitute a violation of the Treaty, but testing and 

deployment of anti-missile interceptors from that site would 

constitute a clear violation of the ABM Treaty. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no quick, easy or cheap national missile defense 

technology. The Bush administration should be careful not to 

give the false impression that it can develop an effective 

national missile defense in the near future,&quot; said Tom Collina 

of the Union of Concerned Scientists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least 20 or more flight intercept tests, plus hundreds of 

component and subsystem tests will be needed before the Pentagon 

will be ready to attempt realistic operational testing of such 

an NMD system, according to the June 2001 report entitled, &quot;NMD 

Development is Not Hostage to the ABM Treaty,&quot; written by Phil 

Coyle, former head of DoD's Operational Test &amp; Evaluation and 

currently at the Center for Defense Information. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The ABM Treaty remains important to arms control as well as 

nuclear nonproliferation because it promotes stability and 

facilitates offensive nuclear weapons reductions. We must work 

with Russia, China, and others to accomplish our global security 

goals and not act unilaterally,&quot; added Rhinelander, the former 

U.S. legal advisor for the Nixon Administration's ABM Treaty 

negotiation team. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Secretary Rumsfeld's announcement that he would seek to 

retire the 50 remaining MX nuclear-armed strategic missiles is 

an important -- though insufficient -- step in the right 

direction,&quot; said Victoria Samson of the Coalition to Reduce 

Nuclear Dangers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rather than rush toward deployment of an unproven NMD 

system, President Bush should pursue deep, verifiable, U.S. and 

Russian nuclear arms reductions, elimination of dangerous, Cold 

War launch-on-warning and targeting plans, and pursue a 

comprehensive nuclear proliferation effort, including the 

Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and a verifiable freeze of 

North Korea's ballistic missile program,&quot; concluded Samson. </font></p>

alliance of 14 national nuclear non-proliferation organizations
