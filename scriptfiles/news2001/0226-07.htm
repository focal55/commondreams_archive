- February 26 - Today the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) declared U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski&#146;s (R-Alaska) National Energy Security Act of 2001 "dead on arrival" since it includes a provision to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil production and fails to seriously address domestic demand.  Opening the Arctic Refuge to the environmentally devastating impacts of oil drilling is opposed by a growing, bipartisan group of Senators, including Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), chairman of the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee, and Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who has pledged to filibuster any bill that includes an Arctic drilling provision.  A recent bipartisan poll conducted by the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund showed that two-thirds (66 percent) of American voters support permanently protecting the Arctic Refuge from oil drilling.

<p style="text-align: justify;">"America needs a sensible energy policy that places serious emphasis on energy conservation and alternative fuels, not exploitation of our natural resources," said Deb Callahan, LCV president.  "Any energy bill that includes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is politically dead on arrival and diverts Congress from developing a comprehensive, effective energy plan that stands a real chance of passage.  Members of Congress should listen to the American people who overwhelmingly support permanent protection for the Arctic Refuge, higher fuel efficiency standards and strong, fully enforced, environmental laws."</p>

	     <p style="text-align: justify;">According to a 1998 U.S. Geological Survey study there is a 50 percent chance of finding, at most, a nine-month supply of oil in the Arctic Refuge, which would take approximately ten years to enter the domestic market.  Oil drilling activity in the Arctic Refuge, which represents only five percent of Alaska&#146;s North Slope and the only place not currently open to drilling, would have drastic environmental consequences.  For example, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, nearby oil fields averaged 409 oil spills annually since 1996.  In general, fossil fuel production from public lands reached an all-time high under the Clinton administration (633 million barrels in 1997) yet 57 percent of oil consumed by American is still produced abroad.  Reducing American dependence on foreign oil must, therefore, also focus on decreasing domestic demand - a topic Murkowski&#146;s bill virtually ignores.</p>
