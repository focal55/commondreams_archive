- MAy 23 - The Canadian-based International Institute for

Sustainable Development (IISD) is launching an electronic listserv for

information and knowledge exchange on Investment Law and Sustainable

Development issues in the Americas.  &quot;Not only will the listserv will

keep its members up-to-date on key events and dates,&quot; Brad Etlin, IISD

listserv moderator, explains. &quot;It will distribute valuable tools for

advocacy including calls-for-action, circulate full-text news items, and

will generally act as a forum for empowering individuals and civil

society organizations with information on Chapter 11 of the North

American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the investment provisions in the

proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and other key issues.&quot;  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People not overly familiar with, but interested in investment law and

sustainable development issues, as well as experts in this area, will

find the listserv valuable resource for articles, analyses, bulletins,

etc. The listserv, moderated by IISD, will allow individual members to

post their own publications and raise for discussion issues that pertain

to the subject matter (English-only please). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The problems with the existing NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions have been all

too well highlighted by a string of recent cases, including:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	*	A successful challenge by U.S.-based Ethyl Corporation

which sought compensation from Canada for banning a suspected carcinogen

called MMT; <br>

	*	A successful challenge of Canada's temporary ban on PCB

exports, by a U.S.-based processor of hazardous wastes; and<br>

	*	The recent NAFTA tribunal decision that ordered Mexico

to financially compensate U.S.-based Metalclad Corporation for

obstructing the company from setting up a hazardous waste facility on

Mexican soil.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each of these cases is a balancing act between the legal rights of

investors under NAFTA and the ability of governments to regulate in the

public interest on matters such as environmental integrity, human health

and safety.  Unfortunately, the cases settled to date suggest that the

balance favours investor interests. (For an excellent analysis of the problems with the existing provisions - including an in-depth analysis

of every Chapter 11 case to date - see the new IISD/WWF-U.S.

publication:  Private Rights, Public Problems: A guide to NAFTA's

controversial chapter on investment at&lt;<a href="http://www.iisd.org/trade/private_rights.htm">http://www.iisd.org/trade/private_rights.htm</a>&gt;).  It has also become

clear from recently leaked Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)

negotiating text on investment that the same mistakes, in a hemispheric

context, are at risk of being repeated.</font></p>
