- February 28 - The Sierra Club today joined with the Waterkeeper

Alliance to announce that it is a "full partner" with the organizations bringing litigation against major pork producing corporations. The lawsuits

aim to stop these factories from polluting America's waterways and fouling

them with animal waste.

<p>

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Jan Schlichtmann, and Charles Speer announced the

filing of multiple lawsuits across the United States against Smithfield operations on behalf of organizations such as the Sierra Club and other individual plaintiffs. Smithfield, a Virginia company, operates massive hog

production operations in several states including North Carolina, Utah, Oklahoma and Missouri. It is the world's largest pork producer.



<p>

"These companies have fouled the air and water of rural America, and run

family farmers out of the hog-raising business," stated Ken Midkiff, Clean

Water Campaign Coordinator for the Sierra Club.  "Since the government is

not protecting our waterways from these polluters, we are forced to step

in."

<p>

"Part of the problem is the revolving door between industry and regulatory

agencies," continued Midkiff. "When enforcers turn into apologists, justice

will not be served." Many of the people who are supposed to enforce the laws protecting our air and water against these factories are now working

for the same corporations they were supposed to be regulating. In the state

of Missouri, the former Director of the Department of Natural Resources is

now the attorney for facilities acquired by Smithfield, and two former

Assistant Attorneys General are acting as legal counsel for Premium

Standard Farms.



<p>

The Sierra Club has been in the forefront of opposition to these

large-scale animal factories. They have joined with rural communities and

family farmers across the nation to rein in the intrusive facilities and

stop their polluting practices.  The Club has documented throughout the country the hundreds of thousands of tons of animal waste that have

illegally entered our air and water from these massive facilities.



<p>

The lawsuits filed today include multiple pollution suits, as well as

common law tort litigation and federal racketeering allegations under the

country's organized crime statutes.

<p>

"These corporations have created what amounts to pollution factories,

pumping out millions of tons of excrement which ends up in our rivers,

streams and estuaries," Midkiff concluded. "We stand today arm in arm with

rural communities, impacted family farmers and this team of attorneys with

a common goal: Keep animal waste out of our water -- stop animal factory

pollution."</p>
