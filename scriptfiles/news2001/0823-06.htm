- August 23 - As the IMF and Argentina's government agree to another loan package of $8 billion and further austerity programs, the following analysts are available for interviews:

Coordinator of Dialogue 2000, a coalition representing human-rights and other groups in

Argentina, Keene said today: &quot;This new agreement with the IMF brings no

resolution to growing unemployment and poverty. In fact, it will only make

things worse since these loans are conditional on implementing more of the

policies that have impaired the economy and taken an enormous human toll due to

the cuts in health and social services.... Argentina will pay some $30 billion

in interest and foreign debt service this year, more than half the national

budget and many times over what it will spend on education and healthcare. This

debt itself is fundamentally illegitimate, in part because it largely

originated in loans taken out by a military junta responsible for the torture

and disappearance of more than 30,000 Argentinians during the so-called 'dirty

war' during the 1970s and '80s. The governments, bankers and corporations of

the rich north are continuing to oppress us by forcing us to pay them back for

their loaning money to the murderous junta."</font></P>

Co-author of the recent report "The Scorecard on Globalization 1980-2000: Twenty Years of

Diminished Progress," Weisbrot said today: "Argentina has borrowed

more than $40 billion at high interest rates to defend its overvalued currency.

That would be the equivalent of our government borrowing $1.4 trillion -- 70

percent of our federal budget -- to defend our own overvalued dollar. For 20

years now, Latin America has followed Washington's advice and slashed tariffs,

swallowed IMF austerity plans and sold off tens of billions of dollars of state

assets to foreigners. This has brought a lot of pain, but no gain. Over the

last 20 years, income per person in Latin America grew by a mere 7 percent,

compared to 75 percent for the two decades before that (1960-1980), when

governments exercised more control over their economic policies."

An economist and author of <I>Democratic Regulation</I>, Palast writes the column

"Inside Corporate America" for Britain's Guardian newspapers. He said

today: "Last September, while Argentina was already on the cliff-edge of a

deep recession, the IMF required Argentina to cut the budget deficit from $5.3

billion to $4.1 billion and asked for 'a 12-15 percent cut in salaries' of

civil servants. The economists at the IMF surely know that holding back government

spending and snuffing out purchasing power in a contracting economy would be

like turning off the engines on an airplane in stall. The payoff for these

delusional and cruel policies was a $26 billion emergency loan package.

However, the IMF also forced Argentina to 'peg' its currency to the dollar,

which meant that Argentina was at the mercy of banks and speculators and ended

up paying a whopping 16 percent risk premium above normal in return for the

dollars needed for this scheme. Argentina's people don't net one penny. Little

of the bailout money escapes New York, where it lingers to pay interest to U.S.

creditors, like Citibank. What's more, the peg causes the peso to remain

overvalued, making it very hard for Argentina to export its way out of recession.

This disaster was created by IMF policies which transformed a mild recession

into a depression and international crisis."</font>
