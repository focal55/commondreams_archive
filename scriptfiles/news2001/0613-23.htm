- June 13 - Results released today of 

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tests on a handful of 

individuals with suspected allergic reactions to StarLink corn do 

not provide a scientifically sound answer to the question of 

whether StarLink's Cry9C protein is a human allergen. In the wake 

of these inconclusive tests, the Genetically Engineered Food Alert 

coalition promised to continue pressing FDA and the Centers for 

Disease Control (CDC) to convene a full and thorough investigation 

of the public health risk StarLink corn may pose to consumers. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Test results from such a small sample could easily have missed 

allergic reactions,&quot; said Bill Freese of Friends of the Earth. 

&quot;The EPA's scientific advisors specifically said that the 

investigation should be broadened, yet FDA chose to ignore that 

advice. A thorough investigation is exactly what the public 

deserves.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no way a credible scientist could rule out Cry9C as a 

potential human allergen,&quot; said Dr. Rebecca Goldburg, senior 

scientist at the Environmental Defense. &quot;I'm especially concerned 

about the risk to children, who are much more vulnerable to 

allergies than adults. The FDA's investigation should have 

included more children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the Scientific Advisory Panel's (SAP) recommendation to 

widen the scope of the investigation, FDA chose to ignore hundreds 

of consumers who reported allergic reactions to corn products that 

may contain StarLink. These reports were unearthed from FDA and 

EPA documents obtained by Genetically Engineered Food Alert. In 

one report, 210 consumers blamed corn for allergic reactions, 74 

visited doctors, while 20 more had to seek emergency care. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would be unacceptable to approve StarLink for human 

consumption when the science is clearly incomplete,&quot; said Matt 

Rand, biotechnology campaign manager at the National Environmental 

Trust. &quot;The American public deserves a full and thorough testing 

of StarLink corn so they do not become the guinea pigs for a 

dangerous experiment on food allergens.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other suggestions that the Scientific Advisory Panel made and 

the FDA ignored include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. According to the SAP's allergy experts, young children are at 

the greatest risk of developing allergies to novel genetically 

engineered proteins such as Cry9C. Yet FDA seems to have tested 

only one child. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The SAP recommended that the medical community should be 

informed of the investigation into the allergenicity of Cry9C in 

corn products. In addition, FDA should monitor reports from the 

medical community to supplement the cases currently under 

investigation and to provide additional support for proving or 

refuting the allergenicity of Cry9C. </font></p>
