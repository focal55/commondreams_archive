- February 15 -  The majority of black and

Hispanic families with children would receive no tax cut if the

Bush tax plan becomes law, according to a new analysis from the

Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan policy

institute in Washington D.C.

<p>The new analysis, "More Than Half of Black and Hispanic Families

Would Not Benefit From Bush Tax Cut," finds that 53 percent of

black and Hispanic families with children would receive no tax

reduction if the Bush plan were enacted. About three in four of

these families include someone who is working.

<p>The six million black and Hispanic families that would receive

no benefit from the proposal include 6.1 million black children and

6.5 million Hispanic children -- or 55 percent of all black

children and 56 percent of Hispanic children.

<p>The outcome reflects a Bush Administration decision not to

provide relief to low- and moderate-income working families that do

not earn enough to owe federal income tax but pay substantial

amounts of payroll and other taxes. Millions of black and Hispanic

families fall into this category. They are among the 74 percent of

American families that pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes.

<p>The center's analysis finds that black and Hispanic children

would be more than twice as likely to fail to receive any

assistance from the Bush tax plan as non-Hispanic white children.

<p>Tax Cut Would Drain Resources for Other Needs

<p>The exclusion of a majority of black and Hispanic families from

the Bush tax plan raises particular concerns, the center said,

because the tax plan would absorb virtually all of the available

budget surpluses projected for the next 10 years. The

administration has said the plan would cost $1.6 trillion over this

period, but the center's analysis finds that when the cost of added

interest payments on the national debt are taken into account, the

cost of the tax cut rises to $2 trillion or more. Interest

payments on the debt would be greater because at least $1.6

trillion of projected surpluses would be used for tax cuts rather

than for paying down the debt.

<p>With Congress walling off the portion of the budget surpluses

that are due to the building of reserves in the Social Security and

Medicare trust funds, the center noted, the amount of the surplus

available for all tax cuts and program initiatives is itself about

$2 trillion. As a result, the Bush tax cut would consume virtually

all of the available budget surpluses, leaving little available for

improvements in other areas, such as reducing the number of

Americans without health insurance, providing more housing that is

affordable for low- and moderate-income families, improving job

training programs, reducing child poverty, providing an adequate

Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors, and the like.

<p>High-Income Households Would Receive Bulk of Tax Cut

<p>Altogether, the administration's tax-cut proposal leaves out 12

million families with children and 24 million children (including

non-minority as well as minority families and children). But the

proposal carries a very high cost because it confers extremely

large tax cuts on wealthy households. The center reported that the

1 percent of households with the highest incomes would receive

about 40 percent of the tax cuts; the tax cut these households

would receive averages about $40,000 per household. By contrast,

the bottom 40 percent of households -- a group that includes a

majority of the black and Hispanic population -- would receive just

4 percent of the tax cuts, while the bottom 60 percent of the

population would receive 13 percent of the tax cuts.

<p>The center's analysis also finds that the top 1 percent of

households would receive more in tax cuts from the Bush plan than

the bottom 80 percent of households combined.

<p>The Bush tax cut leaves out large numbers of low- and

moderate-income families because it applies only to households that

owe federal income or estate taxes, as distinguished from other

taxes such as payroll taxes and excise taxes. A two-parent family

currently does not owe federal income tax until its income exceeds

$25,870. (If the family has child care costs, it owes no income

tax until its income reaches a higher level.) A family at this

level is well above the poverty line and pays several thousand

dollars in payroll taxes but would receive no tax reduction under

the Bush plan.

<p>"Although President Bush has been presenting his tax cut as

helping low- income families enter the middle class, his proposal

does little to achieve this goal," said Isaac Shapiro, who was

joined in authoring the study by Allen Dupree and James Sly.

Instead, Shapiro said, "his tax proposal provides windfalls to the

wealthiest Americans while draining the federal budget of resources

that could help low- and moderate-income families and aid

lower-income communities." The center study concludes that a

sounder approach would be to reduce the cost of the Bush tax plan

substantially by scaling back its very large tax cuts for

high-income individuals, while providing some tax relief to

lower-income families left out of the Bush plan.
