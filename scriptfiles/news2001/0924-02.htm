- September 24 - A Nobel Prize-winning 

physicians group today called on President Bush to not undermine 

years of human rights and arms control work by waiving 

Congressionally-mandated sanctions on rogue nations and nuclear 

proliferators. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We at Physicians for Social Responsibility and our 

colleagues have worked to restrain America's role as the world's 

largest arms dealer for years,&quot; said PSR Executive Director and 

CEO Robert K. Musil, Ph.D M.P.H. &quot;President Bush is attempting 

to cloak this dangerous move in the guise of a necessary 

anti-terrorism tactic. That simply isn't true.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR sees key flaws in the Administration's proposal. First, 

the very heart of our form of government, the system of checks 

and balances, would be voided. The White House could trade 

weapons for information with the least savory international 

characters and nations threatening all of the world with nascent 

nuclear weapons programs. It is the duty of Congress to 

authorize expenditures and set legal restrictions on U.S. trade. 

Their work would be muted if this proposal is accepted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A second danger is the unknown. Our intelligence can not see 

into the future. Too many times, America's participation in the 

world commerce of war has revealed itself as a disastrous 

decision. Arming future revolutions, civil wars, and hostile 

invasive forces should not be America's strategy as we fight 

international terrorism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our intelligence apparatus is the best in the world but 

still couldn't possibly know all the players in any White 

House-initiated arms deal,&quot; said Musil. &quot;How would we know if we 

weren't arming a friend one day, and an enemy the next?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final, and most deadly flaw in the proposal would be the 

undoing of world non-proliferation. For 40 years, Physicians for 

Social Responsibility has advanced the world's slow march to 

what we see as the only final point: nuclear abolition. A vital 

tool in this struggle has been U.S. sanctions against nations 

that have demonstrated that they are building a nuclear 

capability. The U.S. government has already lifted sanctions on 

India and Pakistan, who gained entry into the nuclear club when 

they detonated weapons in May 1998. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When there is no meaningful penalty for bringing the world 

one perilous step closer to a nuclear end, how can 

non-proliferation be accomplished?&quot; said Musil. &quot;The U.S. must 

protect our ability to rise above the terror and our current 

war-fever by protecting the very human rights -- and human lives 

-- that this proposal would compromise.&quot;
