- October 12 - On Monday, Oct. 15, 

members of ACORN in cities around the country will promote an 

economic stimulus package designed to assist those most effected by 

an economic downturn: low- and moderate-income Americans. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To stimulate the economy, what we need to do is get money into 

the hands of those most likely to spend it and those hit hardest by 

a recession, namely low- and moderate-income Americans,&quot; said Maude 

Hurd, national president of ACORN. &quot;Even prior to this economic 

slowdown, jobs and wages were not keeping up with the costs of 

housing, energy, and health care. Now families' financial 

situations have become desperate. ACORN is asking Congress and the 

President to listen to some voices from outside the Beltway.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Low-wage workers are typically the first to be laid off and the 

last to be rehired. Unemployment benefits are reaching only a 

small portion of those laid off. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many economists believe the most effective stimulus would be one 

heavily directed to lower income families. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN Calls on the President and Congress to Include the 

Following Measures in a Stimulus Package: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unemployment Insurance: Eligibility rules should be reformed in 

order to reach more than the 39 percent of unemployed workers who 

currently qualify, to count workers' most recent earning period in 

calculating benefits, and to provide extended benefits beyond the 

initial 26-week period. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Housing: Congress should implement a foreclosure/eviction 

prevention plan and provide $5 billion in immediate funds for the 

HOME Investment Program to build more affordable housing and create 

jobs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Energy: The Bush Administration should stop holding up the 

release of $300 million in emergency funds that Congress 

appropriated for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program 

(LIHEAP), and Congress should provide additional funding for this 

winter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health Care: Congress should expand Medicaid to provide coverage 

for unemployed workers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minimum Wage: Congress should immediately pass a $1.50 increase 

in the federal minimum wage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tax Cuts: Any tax cuts should go to those who did not benefit 

from the rebates earlier this year. Those rebates and the child 

tax credit should be extended to all Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform 

Now, is the nation's largest community organization of low- and 

moderate-income families, with over 100,000 member families 

organized into 500 neighborhood chapters in 40 cities across the 

country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on 

issues of concern to our members. Our priorities include: better 

housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for 

low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks and 

governments, and better public schools. We achieve these goals by 

building community organizations that have the power to win changes 

-- through direct action, negotiation, legislation, and voter 

participation. ACORN's Web site is at <a href="http://www.acorn.org" target="_new">http://www.acorn.org</a></i>
