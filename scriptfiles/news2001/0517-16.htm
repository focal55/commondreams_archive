- May 17 - The following statement 

was released today by ACORN: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These wholesale energy suppliers are making a killing off 

consumers who are being hit with outrageous bills that they 

cannot afford. And the federal government refuses to act,&quot; said 

Maude Hurd, president of ACORN, the Association of Community 

Organizations for Reform Now. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All across the country families are struggling to pay energy 

bills that have doubled and tripled. Approximately one million 

low-income households are unable to pay their utility bills and 

are facing shut-offs. Meanwhile, energy wholesalers are raking 

in enormous record profits, with increases of as much as 40 

percent in profits in 2000, including huge increases in profits 

in California. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 

refused to act to make energy affordable for residential users. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Protests on May 21: 

-- Sacramento (300 ACORN members from around California) 

-- Manhattan (125 ACORN members from NY, NJ, CT, MA, RI) 

-- Washington DC (100 ACORN members from DC, PA, MD) 

-- Houston (60 ACORN members from Houston, Little Rock) 

-- Albuquerque (25 ACORN members) 

-- Chicago (150 ACORN members from Chicago, St. Louis, 

Toledo) 

-- Denver (25 ACORN members) 

-- Portland (40 ACORN members from Portland and Seattle) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Details on the company being targeted will be available May 

20 or 21st. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN's Demands: 

ACORN is demanding that this company use some of its vast 

profits for an expanded energy assistance program, that this 

company help leverage federal government funding for energy 

assistance, and that this company assist in the creation of a 

conservation program that will supply low-income consumers with 

home audits, energy-efficient appliances, and other 

energy-saving steps. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ACORN is the nation's largest community organization of low- 

and moderate-income families, with over 100,000 member families 

organized into 500 neighborhood chapters in 40 cities across the 

country. Since 1970 ACORN has taken action and won victories on 

issues of concern to our members. Our priorities include: better 

housing for first time homebuyers and tenants, living wages for 

low-wage workers, more investment in our communities from banks 

and governments, and better public schools. ACORN's website is 

at <a href="http://www.acorn.org">http://www.acorn.org</a>. </i></font></p>
