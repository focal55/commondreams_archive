- June 21 - Amidst the flurry and media attention on the growing electronics waste

problem, the Electronics Industry Alliance recently unveiled a pilot

project for electronics recycling, but is passing some costs of the program

onto their customers and taxpayers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pilot project was announced a few days after the release of a report

&quot;Poison PCs/Toxic TVs: California's biggest environmental problem you've

never heard of.&quot;

The report, released by the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Californians

Against Waste and Materials for the Future, details the growing piles of

electronics waste in the US, the toxics contained in computers and

monitors, and the hazards of improper disposal.  The report estimates a

cost to California taxpayers of almost $1 billion for handling e-wastes

that consumers and businesses will throw away.  The report is available at

the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition website: <a href="http://www.svtc.org" target="new">http://www.svtc.org</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're sitting on top of a gigantic wasteberg - and in order to find

solutions, the manufacturers of computers must take responsibility for

their products,&quot; said Ted Smith, Executive Director of the Silicon Valley

Toxics Coalition, one of the lead authors of the new report. &quot;They need to

re-design their products to phase out the toxics materials and make

computers and monitors recyclable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are pleased to see the industy's initiative, but their program falls

short of full producer responsibility and they are passing the buck and the

costs of their program on to consumers and the local taxpayers,&quot; said

Smith.  &quot;A recycling program should include: collection, reuse and

recycling of all raw materials, done at no extra cost to consumers or

taxpayers at the time of disposal. After paying over a thousand dollars to

purchase the system, it is difficult for consumers to justify the extra fee

to get rid of the product,&quot; said Smith.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pilot project comes at a much needed time,&quot; said Smith. &quot;Companies can

study the options for a year, but until they look at re-design issues, the

e-waste piles will continue to grow. Disposal options are being cut off

because this equipment is hazardous waste. That is why it is all the more

important for producers to embrace extended producer responsiblity for

their products and not pass on the the costs to either consumers or

taxpayers.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department of Toxics Substances Control, which is the California EPA

department that deals with hazardous waste disposal, announced this March

that products like computer monitors and televisions cannot be disposed of

in municipal landfills.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Press conferences were held this week in several California cities and

resolutions are being drafted urging computer and other electronics

producer to take responsiblity for reuse and recycling of their electronics

products and not solve the problem by  passing on the costs to local

taxpayers.
