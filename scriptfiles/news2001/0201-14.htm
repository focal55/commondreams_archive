- February 1 - The Violence Policy Center

(VPC) will be watching closely to see which John Ashcroft shows up

for work at the Department of Justice: the John Ashcroft who has

consistently opposed even modest gun control laws and worked

hand-in-hand with the gun lobby; or the John Ashcroft who promised

at his confirmation hearing to conscientiously enforce our nation's

gun laws.

<p>The VPC will closely scrutinize Ashcroft's performance enforcing

our nation's gun laws. The Violence Policy Center strongly opposed

Ashcroft's nomination because of his dismal record on gun violence

prevention. In addition, Ashcroft is a member of the National

Rifle Association, an organization that has repeatedly expressed

hostility to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The NRA's

statements regarding federal law enforcement agents so offended

former President George H.W. Bush that he renounced his membership

in the organization in 1995.

<p>We will hold Ashcroft to his sworn testimony in which he said:

"I do not believe that the Second Amendment prohibits common-sense

gun control measures, and if confirmed, as Attorney General I will

vigorously defend federal gun control statutes passed by Congress

whenever there is a good-faith and conscientious basis for doing

so."

<p>The Violence Policy Center also intends to closely monitor the

Justice Department's performance in enforcing laws against illegal

gun traffickers, corrupt gun dealers, felons in possession of

firearms, as well as enforcement of federal bans on assault weapons

and machine guns. The VPC will also scrutinize maintenance of the

National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is under

the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice.

<p><i>The Violence Policy Center is a national non-profit educational

organization working to reduce gun death and injury in America. For
