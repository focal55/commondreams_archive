- July 3 - Members of the Green Party called

for urgent measures to stop the spread of AIDS and get

treatment to millions of infected and ailing people

around the world, and criticized the Bush

Administration for helping to weaken the declaration

drafted at the United Nations special session on

HIV/AIDS earlier this week in New York City.



<p>Greens agree with groups like Doctors Without Borders,

Health Global Access Project (GAP), and ACT UP

Philadelphia and New York on measures urgently

necessary to stop the spread of AIDS, as well as

tuberculosis and other diseases: 



<p>*** The U.S. and international institutions such as

the World Bank and IMF must forgive the debt of

nations in Africa, South America, and Asia which need

tremendous financial resources to prevent AIDS and

deliver treatments.  "Structural adjustment" forced on

developing nations by these institutions has caused

misery and environmental destruction in the name of

global corporate power -- the same power that limits

access to medicine.  U.S. loans to the World Bank and

IMF must be conditional on debt forgiveness and on the

provision of health care, as well as on human rights

and labor rights records and environmental impact

statements.



<p>*** U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has proposed a

Global AIDS and Health Fund; his call for $7-10

billion from wealthy nations would jumpstart this

project.  UNAIDS senior policy officer Julia Celeves

says only about 1.8 billion dollars is currently spent

on AIDS annually -- between 5.2 billion and 8.2

billion less than what is necessary.  



<p>*** All countries must be allowed to develop generic

drugs and shop comparatively on the international

market for the lowest prices in order to get AIDS

drugs to their people.  Even the lowest name-brand

prices are three times the price of the kind of

dollar-a-day generic drugs offered by the Indian firm

Cipla.  Brazil's generic drug program, instituted in

defiance of the U.S. (which tends to side with drug

lobbies), has been a model for other developing

nations.  (ASGP passed a resolution on AIDS drug

pricing in 1999 in reaction to Vice President Al

Gore's role in penalizing South Africa for making

low-cost AIDS drugs available.)



<p>*** Drug companies must not wield control over the

administration of AIDS funding internationally or in

the U.S. and must not be placed in positions of power

to determine AIDS policy.



<p>*** Stigmatizing gay people and other sexual

minorities, single mothers, ethnic minorities,

sexually active teens, prostitutes, drug users, prison

inmates, etc. will not slow the spread of HIV, but

will increase the epidemic by driving people and

sexual practices underground, by exacerbating

ignorance and denial, and by shutting people out of

treatment.



<p>*** Women -- who make up the great majority of AIDS

cases in Africa -- must be given complete power to

govern their lives and their reproductive capacities:

information on HIV prevention, access to contraception

and abortion, and access to medical treatment.  This

is called sexual equality, and the Green Party

supports it.



<p>George W. Bush's AIDS policies, say Greens, emphasize

regressive and ineffectual tactics: exclusive teaching

of abstinence, alienation of people outside of

traditional families, opposition to protections for

gay and lesbian people and other sexual minorities,

lack of concern for women's rights, inappropriate

promotion of religion, and the doctrine that corporate

lobbies should dictate public policy.



<p>The Bush Administration objected to one proposed

clause in the U.N. declaration because "for legal and

constitutional reasons, the United States cannot

accept a 'rights based approach' to HIV/AIDS -- any

more than it can accept a rights based approach to

food, shelter, or hunger."  Furthermore, the U.S.

delegation allegedly pressed for the change of

emphasis in the declaration from criticism of the

intellectual property rights and patents of drug

companies to the much weaker "strengthening

pharmaceutical policies and practices... in order

further to promote innovation."



<p>The administration's ignorance and racial

insensitivity are typified by a statement from USAID

director Andrew Natsios, who said Africans should not

receive AIDS medicines because they "don't know what

Western time is."  Mr. Natsios later apologized, but

the stench of the remark lingers.



<p>Such actions reveal that the White House is more

devoted to pharmaceutical lobbies than to the needs of

the world's sick.  The U.S. was also the only country

that voted nay on a recent U.N. High Commission on

Human Rights resolution demanding access to AIDS

medication for all who need it.



<p>Religious conservatives from some nations blocked

Karyn Kaplan of International Gay and Lesbian Human

Rights Commission from participating in a roundtable

discussion during the U.N. meeting.  Libyan ambassador

Abuzed Omar Dorda told the General Assembly:

"Homosexuality is one of the main causes of this

disease.  In fact, God sent the prophet Lot with a

clear message preventing such practices and banning

them."  Zambia's Roman Catholic Church denounced

detailed information on AIDS prevention for promoting

"moral decay."  



<p>These forces conspired with the U.S. government to

compromise the final version of the U.N. declaration

and succeeded in cutting out mention of populations,

such as homosexuals and prostitutes, at greatest risk

of infection.
