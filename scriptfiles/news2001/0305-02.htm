- March 6 - One-third to one-half

of the children in many states live in families that would not

receive any tax reduction from the President's tax proposal,

according to a new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy

Priorities, a Washington, D.C. policy institute. In 12 states

plus the District of Columbia, at least 40 percent of children

live in such families.

<p>The analysis uses Census Bureau data to estimate, on a

state-by-state basis, the number of families and children under

age 18 who would receive no tax relief from the Bush plan

because these families' incomes are too low for them to owe

federal income taxes. The large majority of these families,

however, work and pay payroll taxes and other taxes unaffected

by the Bush proposal. The Bush plan reduces only income taxes

and taxes on large estates.

<p>Nationwide, an estimated 12.2 million low- and

moderate-income families with children -- 31.5 percent of all

families with children -- would not receive any tax reduction

from the Bush proposal. This finding is consistent with

independent analyses conducted by researchers at the Brookings

Institution, the Urban Institute, and the Institute on Taxation

and Economic Policy. The vast majority of the excluded families

include workers.

<p>"Substantial numbers of children in every state would be left

out of the President's tax plan," said Nick Johnson, who

co-authored the report with Allen Dupree and Isaac Shapiro.

"Furthermore, some states would have especially high numbers of

unaffected children." These states include California (3.7

million children unaffected), Texas (2.3 million), New York (1.9

million), and Florida (1.2 million). In each of another eight

states -- Arizona, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina,

Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee -- families with at least half

a million children would gain nothing from the Bush tax plan.

<p>Among the states where the highest percentages of families

and children would not benefit from the plan are Arizona,

Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana,

New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia, plus the

District of Columbia. In each of those states, an estimated 40

percent to 52 percent of children live in the excluded families.

<p>Even the part of the Bush tax plan that would double the

child tax credit would leave out these families, while providing

the largest tax reductions to families with incomes between

$110,000 and $250,000. The Bush proposal extends the credit to

many families with high incomes who currently receive no credit

at all -- for example, by raising the maximum income a married

couple with two children can earn and still receive the credit

from $130,000 to $300,000. Yet the proposal does not extend the

credit to any additional low- or moderate-income working

families.

<p>Why Benefit Families Who Don't Owe Federal Income Taxes?

<p>Some argue that families who do not owe federal income taxes

should not benefit from the tax plan. This argument has several

flaws, according to the Center's report:

<p>-- A significant number of these families owe federal taxes

other than federal income taxes, often in significant amounts.

In fact, data from the Congressional Budget Office show that in

1999, three- fourths of all U.S. families paid more in federal

payroll taxes than in federal income taxes.

<p>-- Low- and moderate-income families in every state pay state

and local taxes, typically including sales taxes, excise taxes

on such items as gasoline, and property taxes (which landlords

pass on to tenants as higher rents). Though some states have

taken steps to reduce the tax burden on low- income families,

their ability to do so is limited: states that have levied such

taxes for many years cannot simply eliminate them without

dramatic effects on state budgets.

<p>-- A boost in after-tax income would further the objective of

helping working families lift themselves out of poverty. This

objective is a key theme of welfare reform.

<p>-- The Bush approach fails to reduce the high marginal tax

rates that many low-income families face.

<p>For example, families with incomes between about $13,000 and

$20,000 lose more than 50 cents in increased taxes and foregone

benefits for every additional dollar they earn, but the Bush

plan would not reduce these rates. Nor would the plan provide

any marriage penalty tax relief to low- income working families,

although they can face some of the highest marriage tax

penalties of any families.

<p>An alternative to the President's tax proposal -- one that

scaled back (but did not eliminate) the benefits to those at

very high income levels and provided tax reductions to low- and

moderate-income families with children as well -- could be

fashioned for a much smaller cost than the Bush plan. Such an

approach would ensure that the rewards from the surplus are more

broadly distributed throughout the population and also leave

resources for other critical needs that would remain largely

unaddressed under the Bush budget.

One-Half of Families Would Not Benefit from Bush Tax Plan, is
