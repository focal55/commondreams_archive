- May 24 - The Council for a Livable World today welcomed Vermont

Senator James Jeffords' abandoning the Republican party because it may

delay President Bush's goal of deploying quickly a national missile defense

system.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democratic control of the Senate will make it more difficult -- but

certainly not impossible -- for President Bush to deploy an anti-missile

system.

Both incoming Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin and

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden have already been

critical of the President's missile defense plans.  If the President

approves construction this year at the Alaskan radar site, the first step

of a missile defense system, he will have to overcome the opposition of

Chairman Levin and other Democrats.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Council pointed out that these two Senators, plus Majority Leader Tom

Daschle critically responded to the President's May 1 missile defense speech 

at National Defense University.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This abrupt change in leadership places significant hurdles in President

Bush's hellbent drive to deploy a national anti-missile system,&quot; said John

Isaacs, President of the Council for a Livable World, a Washington,

D.C.-based pro-arms control group.  &quot;With Senators Daschle, Biden and Levin

leading the fight to prevent rapid deployment of an ABM system, we have a

much better chance of winning.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arms control treaties, opposed by many Republicans, including Sen. Jesse

Helms (R-NC), outgoing chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, will

receive more sympathetic treatment in the Armed Services and Foreign

Relations Committees.  Sens. Biden and Levin are likely to hold hearings

and feature witnesses critical of abandoning the ABM Treaty and proceeding

with missile defense. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is also important,&quot; continued Isaacs, &quot;that Sen Jeffords cited missile

defense as one of the major issues on which he disagrees with the

Republican position.  In 1998, Senator Jeffords voted twice with the

Republican leadership of missile defense procedural votes when Republicans

tried to force a vote on the issue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the Democratic Senate is likely to continue appropriating large sums

for missile defense research and testing, it will be more resistant to

deployment funding and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's anticipated requests

for arms in space. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While there has not been a major change in votes, Democrats now control

the Senate's legislative agenda, set up hearings and invite the bulk of the

witnesses.  This will definitely put a crimp in Bush's Star Wars plans,&quot;

added Isaacs.</font></p>
