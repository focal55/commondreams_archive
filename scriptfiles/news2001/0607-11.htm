As Strategy to Kill Workplace Safety Rules<br>

- June 7 - Responding to the Bush Administration&#146;s announcement today

that it plans to hold additional public forums  to determine whether or not the

federal government should regulate workplace safety conditions, U.S. Senator

Paul Wellstone (D-MN), imminent Chairman of the Employment, Safety, and Training

subcommittee, strongly criticized the decision as a blow to working men and

women across America.  Wellstone said the announcement was a continuation of the

Bush Administration strategy to overturn ten years of work by the Department of

Labor on workplace injuries, and countless studies and broad consultation with

employers across the country, begun under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole in the

early 1990s.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This time-line and framework is just a continuation of the White House's effort

to delay and forestall effective action to address the hundreds of thousands of

needless ergonomics injuries that take place each year.  This Administration and

the then-Republican Congress killed the regulation that represented the correct

approach.  Ergonomics injuries are the biggest job safety and health problem in

our country today.  We already have an exhaustive record , including a National

Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine report, which unambiguously shows

that exposure to hazards in the workplace causes ergonomic disorders, and that

these injuries can be prevented. We don't need more study -- we need action --

now,&#148; Wellstone said.    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first substantive piece of legislation that President Bush signed was a bill

overturning OSHA's ergonomics standard; a rule that was ten years in the making

that the Republican-controlled House and Senate overturned after just 11 hours

of debate.  Since President Bush and Congressional Republicans killed the

ergonomics rule, it is estimated that 376,000 workers have been injured in the

workplace.  Every year 1.8 million workers incur ergonomics injuries -- 600,000

of these serious enough to require time off from work.  Since 1990 six million

workers have suffered serious injuries from exposure to ergonomics hazards.  The

ergonomics rule would net businesses an average of $4.6 billion in savings every

year over the next ten years.  The standard was developed with extensive public

input, including five public hearings, 700 witnesses and 8000 written comments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I intend to make sure that the Senate's Employment, Safety and Training

Subcommittee is a forum where working people's health and safety, and working

families' standard of living, is put first. We're going to be looking closely at

the Administration's actions on ergonomic injuries very soon,&quot; Wellstone

said.</font></p>
