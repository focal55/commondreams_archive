<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GOTHENBURG, Sweden - June 14  - The following is a 

statement by Phillip Clapp, President of the National Environmental 

Trust, on the Bush-EU Talks on Global Warming: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite all the words of cooperation, the President found himself 

completely isolated today on global warming and the Kyoto Protocol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, previously a Bush 

ally on Kyoto, said at a Brussels press conference yesterday that his 

country had &quot;signed up to the Kyoto Protocol&quot; and would honor it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While they knew he opposed the Kyoto Protocol, it has been 

shocking to Europeans to hear President Bush mouth word-for-word the 

arguments against action on global warming made by OPEC and oil 

industry lobbyists for the past decade. This may not surprise 

Americans any more, but this is the first time European leaders have 

seen it up close. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's statement this afternoon that his energy plan 

would cut U.S. global warming pollution is absolutely false. The 

vast majority of his proposals are aimed at increasing fossil fuel 

production in the United States. Over the next decade, the 

President's energy plan will increase U.S. global warming pollution 

by at least 35 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The central issue for the Europeans is simple: Kyoto aside, will 

President Bush agree to any binding commitment to reduce U.S. global 

warming pollution? The President had no direct answer, although his 

statements implied that he will only support voluntary measures. Ten 

years of voluntary programs in the U.S., begun by the President9s 

father and continued through the Clinton Administration, have had no 

impact -- U.S. emissions grew by 13 percent in the 1990's. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has also been growing concern among European governments 

that the Bush Administration is trying to torpedo talks aimed at 

completing the Protocol next month. While the President assured the 

Europeans that the U.S. would participate, Administration officials 

would not commit to having a U.S. policy proposal ready for the talks 

in Bonn (July 16-27), and the White House is pressuring the Japanese 

government not to cooperate in reaching a final deal European nations 

can ratify by next year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if the President refuses to act now on global warming, he 

should get out of the way and let the rest of the developed world get 

on with it. </font></p>
