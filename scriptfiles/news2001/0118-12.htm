- January 18 - A bill introduced today by California Senate President 

    John Burton today would help the state become more energy self sufficient 

    and protect consumers from price gouging in the future, according to Consumers 

    Union. The consumer organization endorsed SB 6X, which creates the California 

    Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. SB 6X was co-authored 

    by Assemblymember Jackie Goldberg and is also supported by state Treasurer 

    Philip Angelides.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe this is an essential step to ensuring a reliable and reasonably 

    priced supply of energy for California,&quot; said Harry Snyder, Senior Advocate 

    for Consumers Union's West Coast Regional Office in San Francisco. &quot;We 

    urge state lawmakers to make the creation of a state power authority a top 

    priority as they look to clean up the mess created by the failure of deregulation.&quot; 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under Senator Burton's proposal, the power authority would be empowered to 

    finance the construction of additional generating capacity, energy efficiency 

    and conservation programs, and assist with financing to make necessary retrofits 

    to improve the plants efficiency and environmental performance of older power 

    plants. The authority would consider the feasibility of the state acquiring 

    and operating transmission facilities currently owned by investor-owned and 

    municipal utilities. It would also develop a strategy for making necessary 

    investments to assure a sufficient supply of natural gas. The Authority would 

    underwrite its work through the issuance of bonds and the sale of land and 

    facilities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;California's future economic success depends on our ability to regain 

    control over the state's energy resources,&quot; said Snyder. &quot;This proposal 

    offers a means to ensure adequate power supplies, reduce demand through conservation, 

    and help stabilize rates.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers Union has also urged state lawmakers to require PG&amp;E and Edison 

    to sell the power they generate to homeowners, renters, and small businesses, 

    on a cost plus reasonable rate of return basis subject to rate making by the 

    P.U.C. The group has also urged the state to provide Californians who are 

    on fixed incomes, retirees, and low-income consumers with additional financial 

    assistance to help with increased electric utility bills.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Requiring PG&amp;E and Edison to sell their in-state power to core 

    customers at a cost-plus reasonable return basis will help stabilize prices 

    for California ratepayers and protect consumers from price gouging by out-of-state 

    suppliers,&quot; Snyder said.</font></p>
