- February 22 - The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) this week led two days of events designed to turn the spotlight on the hate lyrics of Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist Eminem. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;From the day Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP was released last May, GLAAD has worked toward a singular goal: to increase public awareness by initiating a high-profile national dialogue about the impact of hate lyrics and the continued glorification of violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,&quot; said GLAAD News Media Director Cathy Renna. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our campaign and public dialogue is not, nor has it ever been, about restricting or curtailing anyone's speech,&quot; Renna said. &quot;If anything, this has been about more speech, not less. It's been about injecting the reality of prejudice, hate and violence against our community into the mainstream consciousness, showing first-hand the powerful role popular culture plays in shaping attitudes and beliefs toward lesbian and gay people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, Feb. 20, GLAAD co-sponsored (with the Recording Academy) &quot;Intolerance in Music: A Town Hall Meeting&quot; at the Los Angeles Public Library's Mark Taper Auditorium. The event allowed youth activists to voice their concerns about Eminem's lyrics to a panel that included Recording Academy president/CEO Michael Greene, GLAAD Entertainment Media Director Scott Seomin, L.A.-area youth activist Jessie Funes, 16-year-old Eminem fan (and fan site creator) Andrea Aguilar, and Beyond Music executive Todd Bisson. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;'Intolerance in Music' exemplified the role GLAAD plays in bringing together different sides of an issue and leading a robust discussion -- this time about issues of artistic and corporate responsibility,&quot; Seomin said. &quot;The forum allowed Michael Greene to hear the stories of the very youth targeted by Eminem's violent epithets.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The same day, GLAAD sponsored another panel discussion in its New York office. &quot;Homie-Sexual Hip-Hop&quot; examined the intersection of hip-hop, race and homophobia in the Eminem controversy. Among the panelists were: Shant&eacute; Smalls, a Ralph J. Bunche Fellow at Amnesty International's OutFront; Karter Louis, an out hip-hop artist and executive producer of &quot;Twisted Tongues&quot;; James Earl Hardy, author of the B-Boy Blues novel series; Star Perkins, an out lesbian D.J. and hip-hop culture expert; and Jason King, adjunct professor at New York University, where he teaches a class on hip-hop. The panel was moderated by GLAAD Cultural Interest Media Manager Loren Javier. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Grammy ceremonies began on Wednesday, Feb. 21, GLAAD led a diverse coalition of LGBT and allied organizations to protest Eminem's lyrics at the Grammy Awards outside Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles. GLAAD was joined by the National Organization for Women (NOW); the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN); the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center; Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG); The Matthew Shepard Foundation; the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC); California National Organization for Women; the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects (NCAVP); PFLAG/LA; the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (UFMCC); Congregation Kol Ami; Women's Cultural Arts Association; and Outmusic, the national LGBT musician's network. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The controversy surrounding Eminem's hate lyrics was the big story at the Grammys this year,&quot; Renna said. &quot;Our work ensured that every celebrity on the red carpet was asked about hate lyrics, and the media ensured that this debate reached everybody with even a passing interest in the awards. Whether you were on the streets with a sign, on the red carpet at Staples Center, watching the Grammys at home, or reading about them the day after the event, you were thinking about the impact of hate lyrics.&quot; </font></p>
