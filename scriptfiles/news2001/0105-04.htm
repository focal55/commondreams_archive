Bush Makes Wrong Choices for Interior Secretary and Attorney General</font></div>

- January 5 - The Sierra Club today launched campaigns to oppose

President-elect George W. Bush's nominations of Gale Norton as the

Secretary of the Interior and John Ashcroft as Attorney General.  Both

nominees have dismal environmental records.

<p>

"Gale Norton would be a natural disaster as Interior Secretary.  Norton is

the oil, mining and timber industry's choice.  She favors increasing the

commercial and environmentally destructive development of our national

parks, forests and wild lands," said Carl Pope, Executive Director for the

Sierra Club.

<p>

Norton formerly worked at the extremist Mountain States Legal Foundation,

where she was a protege of James Watt.  Watt was later ousted as Secretary

of Interior for his radical anti-lands agenda.  During the Reagan

administration, Norton served as associate solicitor at the Interior

Department, authoring legal opinions to support drilling the pristine

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an issue that will be hotly debated at the

beginning of the 107th Congress.  Norton has also labeled government

protections of endangered species an example of excessive regulation.

<p>

Norton is also the founder and serves on the advisory committee of the

Coalition of Republican Environmental Advocates (CREA), which is considered

by the Republicans for Environmental Protection (a legitimate GOP

environmental group) to be "a transparent attempt to fool voters who care

about environmental protection."  Contributors to CREA include several

energy companies and associations representing the mining, logging,

chemical and coal industries.

<p>

Norton is a strong advocate of Colorado's "self-audit" law, which gives businesses immunity from legal penalties if they report and correct their

violations of environmental standards.  The U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) has objected to these self-audit laws.

<p>

Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft, former senator from Missouri, is

equally disappointing.  "In light of his poor environmental record and his

open hostility to most environmental laws, how can we expect Senator

Ashcroft, as Attorney General, to enforce environmental laws?" said Pope.

<p>

While in the Senate, Ashcroft voted against additional funding for

environmental programs including the Clean Water Action Plan and toxic

waste cleanups at Superfund sites.  He also voted in favor of a bill to roll back clean water protections, to prevent the EPA from enforcing

arsenic standards for drinking water, and to allow mining companies to dump

cyanide and other mining waste on large areas of public lands next to

mining sites.

<p>

Ashcroft also opposes campaign finance reform.  He voted against the

McCain-Feingold bill for a complete ban on soft money contributions to

political parties.  This bill would have closed a loophole that allows

mining, timber and other interests to gain influence by contributing huge

unregulated sums of money to political parties.

<p>

To block their appointments, the Sierra Club will be mobilizing its more

than 630,000 members, working in coalition with other environmental and progressive groups and using radio, television and newspaper advertisements

to educate the public about the bleak environmental records of Norton and

Ashcroft.
