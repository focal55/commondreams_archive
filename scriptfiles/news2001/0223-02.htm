- February 23 -  The White House e-mail

system has been so overwhelmed by people petitioning the

president to reverse his position on allowing oil companies to

drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, thousands of

e-mails have been returned to their senders, according to

Defenders of Wildlife.

<p>In only the first month of Defenders' electronic petition

drive to save the refuge, supporters sent more than 650,000

e-mails to President Bush and Congress.

<p>"This phenomenal response shows that people are

overwhelmingly against exploitation of 'America's Serengeti,'"

Defenders president Rodger Schlickeisen says. "It's quickly

mushrooming into the largest Internet petition campaign ever."

<p>The e-mails have been sent from the Defenders' Web site

<a href="http://www.SaveArcticRefuge.org">http://www.SaveArcticRefuge.org

</a>-- as part of the

organization's massive online petition drive to protect the

nation's most magnificent wildlife sanctuary and one of the few

truly wild places left in the country.

<p>Because its computers cannot handle the volume, the White

House has returned thousands of e-mails. Computer system

administrators at Defenders have concluded that an overwhelmed

e-mail system at the White House is apparently to blame. An

administrator sent a letter to the White House pointing out the

problem, but there has been no response.

<p>Senate Republicans are expected to introduce a bill next

week to allow drilling in the refuge's coastal plain, even

though the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the wildlife

preserve holds only a six-month supply of oil.

<p>"BP Amoco and other multinational oil giants would destroy

the habitat with its rich diversity of wildlife -- including

caribou, polar bears, wolves, muskoxen and millions of migratory

birds -- all for a supply of oil that would only last 180 days,"

Schlickeisen says. "And we wouldn't see a drop of that oil for

10 years. Obviously, that won't solve our energy problems."

<p>The first to sign Defenders' petition was Jamie Rappaport

Clark, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the

Clinton administration.

<p>"When the Bush administration proposes to open the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge and its coastal plain to oil

development, they are advocating sticking oil wells right smack

in the biological heart of the wildest place left in America.

It's tugging at a thread that could unravel the entire 19

million acre Arctic Refuge and a lot more as well," says Clark,

who directed the Fish and Wildlife Service from 1997 until Bush

took office.

<p>The petition urges Bush and Congress not to allow oil

exploration in the refuge, the only remaining five percent of

Alaska's North Slope not already open to drilling. Recent

public-opinion polls show most Americans are against it, and

even those who voted for Bush oppose drilling by a 52 percent to

37 percent margin.
