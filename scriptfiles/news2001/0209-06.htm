<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN DIEGO  

- February 9 - The University of San Diego Center for Public Interest Law has announced an unprecedented gathering of public interest advocates to formulate a plan of action to take the offensive against organized profit interests that have kept the public interest movement on the defensive for the past 25 years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Public Interest Law Summit: Taking the Offensive will convene on the University of San Diego campus Friday and Saturday, March 23 &amp; 24, 2001.  The event will open with a keynote address by consumer advocate and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader.  </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Four sessions will follow over the two days focused on: campaign finance reform; legislative reform; court strategy; and agency reform.  </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each session will be charged with the task of developing strategies to move from the reactive to the proactive on public interest issues in each of these arenas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Robert C. Fellmeth, Director of the USD Center for Public Interest Law, &quot;Public interest advocates have never sat down together to plan proactive strategies to address the fundamental process issues that prevent the voices of the unorganized and the future from being heard.  We think it's time. Our goal with this conference is to develop an agenda to influence the rules of the game so that government serves the public interest.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are especially pleased with the response from our colleagues throughout the country.  The moderators and panelists represent nearly every major advocacy organization in the U.S. from civil rights to environment to taxpayer and consumer rights,&quot; continued Fellmeth.	</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Participants in this event include: the American Civil Liberties Union; Brennan Center for Justice, NYU School of Law; Center for Public Integrity; Center for Public Interest Law; Citizen Advocacy Center; Common Cause; Consumers Union; Demos:  A Network for Ideas and Action; Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights; NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund; National Association of Consumer Advocates; Natural Resources Defense Council; Public Campaign; Public Citizen; U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have seen the political and legal systems of our state and nation change over the past fifty years. Our legislature, our courts, and our administrative agencies increasingly serve wealthy, short-term, profit interests, and betray the unorganized - such as the consumer, the environment, children and other future interests,&quot; said Fellmeth.</font></p>
