- October 11 - &quot;In this time of national and global turmoil, the reasons we celebrate Coming Out Day are more visible and more important than ever,&quot; said NOW Action Vice President Olga Vives, who is encouraging NOW chapters across the country to go forward with local actions during the month of October.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Every year, National Coming Out Day commemorates the 1987 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. On October 11 and throughout the month, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) activists celebrate their community, while LGBT allies &quot;come out&quot; against homophobia and heterosexism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Jerry Falwell blamed lesbians, gays and feminists for the September 11 attacks, he voiced loud and clear the prejudice and cruelty that hurts all of us,&quot; said Vives. &quot;Coming Out Day can help remind people like Falwell that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people contribute much to our society and deserve the same freedoms and civil rights as everyone.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vives continued, &quot;Rugby player Mark Bingham was one of the passengers who reportedly helped protect the U.S. Capitol building, the White House and countless lives when he and other passengers stopped the hijackers on Flight 93, which crashed in a Pennsylvania field. He was gay. So was the co-pilot of Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon, and the Fire Department chaplain who died administering aid at the World Trade Center.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;And at this moment there are lesbian and gay soldiers fighting overseas for our freedom from terrorist attacks,&quot; said Vives. The U.S. military has temporarily stopped its discharge of lesbian and gay service members, but they may face dismissal once the conflict is over. &quot;Considering the military's willingness to put lesbian and gay lives at risk during war and then turn its back on them during peacetime, NOW is calling for a permanent lift of the ban.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Especially in light of recent attacks, NOW is also urging activists to lobby their representatives&#151;both in the House and the Senate&#151;to pass the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (LLEEA, S.625), which would strengthen existing protections against race and religion-based hate crimes, while extending hate crimes legislation to cover sexual orientation, gender and disability.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Coming out is a courageous act in the face of bigotry and even violence,&quot; said Vives. &quot;We celebrate the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people who risk so much, reminding the world that we are family, friends, co-workers, neighbors and heroes.&quot; </font></p>
