- October 16 - NARAL President Kate Michelman announced today that NARAL opposes the confirmation of Charles Pickering, Sr. to the U.S. Court of Appeals. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Judge Pickering is a staunch opponent of Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose. He was a prime architect of the 1976 Republican Party platform plank that protested the Roe decision and called for a constitutional amendment banning abortion,&quot; said Michelman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Judge Pickering is the first demonstrably anti-choice judicial nominee to the Court of Appeals to get a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has been nominated for a lifetime position on the bench. If confirmed, the decisions he makes could affect the reproductive rights of women for generations to come. &quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anti-choice Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) is holding up the entire congressional appropriations process until Charles Pickering, Sr., a judge from his home state, receives a hearing this Thursday on his nomination to the appellate court. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even in these trying times, opponents of a woman's right to freedom of choice continue to press their goal of packing the court with anti-choice judges. They are willing to risk funding of our national government in order to short circuit the judicial confirmation process in the U.S. Senate. It is unconscionable that the Senate Republican Leadership would hold up the entire appropriations process to impose their own ideological agenda upon the nation's courts,&quot; said Michelman. </font></p>
