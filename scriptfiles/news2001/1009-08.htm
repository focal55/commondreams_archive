- October 9 - In the wake of the 11 September World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks,

Congress should dramatically increase funding for programs that secure and

eliminate Russia's massive stockpiles of nuclear, biological, and chemical

weapons-usable materials so that these materials do not fall into the hands

of terrorists, according to a letter signed by prominent arms control

experts. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our cooperative security relationship with Russia is an essential

component of the war against terrorism,&quot; the letter states. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter, signed by Matthew Bunn of Harvard, Frank N. von Hippel of

Princeton, Ken Luongo, former Director of the Office of Arms Control and

Nonproliferation at the Department of Energy, John Isaacs of Council for a

Livable World, and Steve LaMontagne of Council for a Livable World

Education Fund, echoes the recommendations of a January 2001 task force led

by former Senator Howard Baker (R-TN) and former White House counsel Lloyd

Cutler. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Baker/Cutler task force called on the U.S. to develop and implement a

$30 billion strategic plan &quot;to secure and or neutralize in the next eight

to ten years all nuclear weapons-usable material located in Russia and to

prevent the outflow from Russia of scientific expertise that could be used

for nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the wake of the tragic attacks that took place on September 11, 2001,

the Baker/Cutler recommendations deserve special attention,&quot; the letter

claims. &quot;We are writing to urge you to allocate a portion of the current

$40 billion supplemental and any additional supplemental budget request to

increase substantially U.S. funding for nonproliferation efforts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contrary to his campaign promise to ask Congress to &quot;increase

substantially&quot; U.S. assistance to nonproliferation programs in Russia,

President Bush's fiscal 2002 budget request slashed approximately $100

million from Department of Energy nonproliferation programs and nearly $40

million from the Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction

(Nunn-Lugar) program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We must work in close partnership with Russia to accelerate and expand

cooperative security efforts, to bolster them with high level coordination

and leadership, and to fund them at a level that enable their urgent

mission to be fulfilled.&quot; the letter concludes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Copies of the letter are available upon request.</font></p>
