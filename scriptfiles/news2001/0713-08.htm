- July 13 - Following is a

statement by Gloria Feldt, president, Planned Parenthood

Federation of America:

<p>"Family planning services, including contraception, are an

essential part of basic healthcare for women. Many countries

make these services universally available to all who need them.

In the United States, individuals with low incomes must often

rely on a variety of fragmented programs to help offset the

cost."

<p>"These programs have particular importance to low-income

women who have just given birth and may not be ready to be

pregnant again for some time. Pregnant women who qualify for

Medicaid can receive 60 days of family planning services

following their delivery. But 60 days just isn't long enough.

That's why many states have long sought and received federal

waivers that have allowed them to extend this benefit. Waivers

have also been granted to allow states to provide family

planning benefits to women who did not previously qualify for

Medicaid. But that may be changing."

<p>"State health officials in Georgia recently had a request to

extend these benefits for up to two years denied, despite the

fact that many other states have been granted similar requests.

According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a top Medicaid

official stated that the Bush administration "would not approve

any family planning waivers."

<p>"All pregnancies have a significant impact on a woman's

health and well-being, and the consequences of unintended

pregnancies can be particularly dire. This is especially true

for women who lack financial resources. And yet, despite

campaign promises to care for all Americans, President Bush

continues to slap women in the face. Furthermore, it is the

height of hypocrisy for a president who opposes a woman's right

to choose, to also limit women's access to the very thing that

prevents unintended pregnancies and makes abortions less

necessary. It's time for the attacks on women's health to

stop."
