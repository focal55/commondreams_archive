- February 27 - In a victory for clean air, the US Supreme

        Court today upheld the authority of the EPA to set smog and soot standards. The court's

        ruling came in a case filed by industry groups that argued the Clean Air Act is

        unconstitutional and that clean air standards must be based on consideration of compliance

        costs. Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., S.Ct. No. 99-1257 (2/27/01).

<p>&quot;The Supreme Court has upheld the Clean Air Act's central mandate to protect the

        public health against pollution that kills tens of thousands of people each year,&quot;

        said Howard Fox of Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, which represented American Lung

        Association in the case. &quot;Industry's attempt to dilute public health protection has

        met with a resounding defeat. The Supreme Court's decision vindicates what then-Governor

        Christine Todd Whitman said in her brief: industry's argument was not only meritless, but

        'borders on the wholly frivolous.'&quot;</p>

        <p>At issue in the case were 1997 national air quality standards for particles (soot) and

        ozone (smog) -- standards which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates will

        each year prevent thousands of premature deaths, tens of thousands of hospitalizations and

        other illnesses for respiratory and cardiovascular causes, and millions of days of missed

        work and school.</p>

        <p>The 1997 standards were challenged by industry and three states, and in 1999 the United

        States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Clean Air Act

        as interpreted by EPA represents an unconstitutional delegation of Congress's legislative

        authority. American Lung Association, represented by Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund,

        intervened to oppose the industry and state challenges, and -- along with several states

        including California, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey, among others

        -- filed briefs in support of EPA's appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

        <p>Today the Supreme Court unanimously rejected industry's constitutional argument.

        &quot;The Court confirmed that Congress didn't violate the Constitution when it directed

        EPA to set air quality standards that 'protect the public health,' and EPA didn't violate

        it by setting standards that better protect Americans from death, hospitalization, and

        illness,&quot; said Fox.</p>

        <p>The Court also rejected industry's counter-attack, which challenged EPA's thirty-year

        old practice of basing air quality standards on public health, and leaving compliance

        costs to be considered later, when the standards are implemented: &quot;Industry has

        repeatedly tried to persuade Congress to amend the Act to allow cost-benefit analysis, but

        Congress has refused,&quot; said Fox. &quot;The Supreme Court correctly rejected

        industry's attempt to obtain from the unelected judiciary what it has been unable to

        obtain from the elected members of Congress.&quot;</p>

        <p>One issue -- specifically, the timetable for meeting the new ozone standard -- was sent

        back to EPA for further consideration. Importantly, the Court did not accept industry's

        argument that EPA could not implement the new ozone standard at all, but merely ruled that

        the agency has to develop a &quot;reasonable&quot; approach for doing so.</p>
