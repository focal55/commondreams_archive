- June 6 -  A 90-page Consumer Federation of America study,

released this morning, concludes that California has the most

pro-consumer auto insurance regulation in the nation.  The report found that the

provisions of Proposition 103 -- passed by California voters in 1988 --

led to the creation of a regulatory system that benefitted both consumers

and insurers alike.



<p>"Prop. 103 created a system with higher profits, lower rate

increases, and more rapid declines in assigned rate drivers than in any

other state," said J. Robert Hunter, CFA's Director of Insurance and

former Texas Insurance Commissioner, who prepared the study.  "Instead of

eagerly embracing industry deregulation proposals, state insurance commissioners should look to California for guidance about how to effectively regulate personal lines of insurance," he added.



<p>Consumers spend, on average, more on auto insurance than on any

other type of insurance

-- annually, an average of more than $700 per car and more than $1,500

per

household -- well over $100 billion nationwide.  Their concern about

rising

auto insurance rates, more than any other factor, led to voter approval

of

the California initiative which insurers spent tens of millions of

dollars

trying to defeat.



<p><b>California Drivers Gain Lower Rates While Insurers Profit

</b>

<p>After passage of Prop. 103, California drivers received rate

rollbacks totaling $1.3 billion.  But their greatest gain was rates that



declined over the next decade.  From 1989 to 1998, auto insurance rates

declined by 4 percent in California while they were rising by more than

25

percent in the rest of the country.  That decline represents the lowest

rate

of change of any state in the nation.



<p>During the same period, California auto insurers were enjoying

healthy profits.  A calculation of annual return on net worth from 1990

to

1999 reveals that these insurers received 16.0 percent compared to only

10.9

percent received by auto insurers nationally.



<p><b>More Competition and Smarter Regulation Explain Lower Rates

</b>

<p>Despite industry opposition, Prop. 103 created a system mixing

greater competition with smarter regulation and greater consumer

participation.  The result was lower consumer rates and higher industry

profits.





<p>Greater Competition:  To promote competition, the initiative

eliminated the state antitrust exemption, allowed banks to sell

insurance,

allowed groups to make purchases collectively, enabled

insurance agents to rebate part of their commissions, and greatly

improved

consumer information.

In regard to the latter, Prop. 103 required the California Commissioner

to

provide consumers with a current rate comparison survey for all personal



lines of insurance.



<p>Smarter Regulation:  Prop. 103 required insurers to open their books

to justify rate increases or decreases.  For the first time in the

state,

insurers were provided with financial incentives for efficient

performance.

Most importantly, this "prior approval" regulatory system effectively

ended

the traditional "cost-plus" method of insurer pricing in which there was



little incentive for insurers to restrain losses and operate

efficiently.

Insurers began to actively hold down costs.



<p>Prop. 103 also provided consumers with "good driver" incentives

while reducing the discriminatory impact of risk factors over which

drivers

had little or no control.  "Clean" drivers received a 20 percent

discount

and also the right to purchase insurance from the company of their

choice

through the initiative's "good driver protections."  This was an

important

reason that the proportion of those who were uninsured or insured in the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan dropped from by more than 50%

from

1989 to 1999.



<p>Greater Consumer Participation:  Prop. 103 also allowed greater

consumer participation by providing funding for consumer intervention if

the

intervenors make a "substantial contribution" to the case.  This

provision

not only helped empower California consumers; it also helped keep

insurance

regulators honest.



<p><b>Insurer Criticism of Prop. 103 Is Weak

</b>

<p>The insurance industry and its partisans offer weak criticism of

Prop. 103.  That criticism  includes the claim that the initiative

allowed

them to gain excessive profits.  They argue that, had insurers been free

to

increase rates without regulatory approval, they would have lowered

their

prices even more than they did, knowing that they could later increase

rates

freely if conditions changed.



<p>However, insurer profits were high not only because Prop. 103

rationalized the regulatory system but also because of the generosity of



Insurance Commissioner Quackenbush to the industry.  Quackenbush,

commissioner from 1995 to 2000, refused to investigate, let alone limit,



insurer profits.  Later, it became clear that some of the same companies

who

benefited from the Commissioner's refusal to use his regulatory powers

under

103 were companies that provided money to various slush funds he was

amassing outside of government in exchange for favors.



<p>Insurers also argue that greater use of seat belts in California was

largely responsible for lower rates in that state.  However, data show

that,

from 1989 to 1998, seatbelt use in California rose by only 34 percent

while

it was rising by 54 percent in the rest of the country.



<p><b>CFA Calls On Insurance Regulators to Consider California System

</b>

<p>"As the NAIC studies personal lines regulation, it should not simply

deregulate the current non-competitive systems," said Hunter.  "Instead,



NAIC should adopt the sort of full competition and excellent regulatory

backup that Prop. 103 has provided for California's consumers.  Why not

the

best for all the people of America?" Hunter asked.



<p>CFA will be distributing copies of the report at the upcoming

National Association of Insurance Commissioners' meeting in New Orleans

this

weekend.  It also will be mailing copies to each state regulator.

Finally,

it will be distributing copies to national policymakers and other

experts

concerned about insurance regulation.
