<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON -  December 3 - The non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics is launching an effort to increase enforcement of the nation&#146;s campaign finance, lobbying, and ethics laws. The Center&#146;s new FEC Watch project will monitor the enforcement activities of the Federal Election Commission and other government entities, including the Department of Justice and congressional ethics committees, and will aggressively seek to have those entities enforce the law. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Neither the FEC nor the Department of Justice can be relied upon to effectively enforce campaign finance laws, and the enforcement of lobbying and ethics laws is lax at best,&#148; said Larry Noble, CRP&#146;s executive director and former general counsel at the FEC. &#147;There is an urgent need for an independent, objective watchdog group like the Center to monitor administration of these laws aimed at reducing the corruptive influence of money in politics.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The director of FEC Watch is Paul Sanford, who joined the Center last month after 10 years at the FEC as a staff attorney in the Office of General Counsel. While at the FEC, Sanford worked on policy issues in many areas of campaign finance law, including soft money, the use of the Internet for campaign activity, personal use of campaign funds, and election-related activity by nonprofit corporations. Sanford holds a bachelor&#146;s degree from Ohio University and a law degree from the University of Toledo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CRP first created FEC Watch in 1991, and during the next six years the project successfully focused public and media attention on the regulatory actions of the FEC. The project ceased operation in 1997 due to shifts in organizational priorities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The nation&#146;s increased attention to campaign finance issues in recent years has not resulted in more lawful conduct by candidates; nor has it made regulatory agencies more aggressive in administering election laws,&#148; Sanford said. &#147;Our aim is to encourage the rigorous enforcement of campaign finance and ethics laws and regulations as they were originally intended, so that the public is better served.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To achieve these goals, FEC Watch will: </font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">seek enforcement of the present laws by filing complaints before appropriate agencies, congressional committees, and courts;<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">petition for and comment on rulemakings to ensure that the campaign finance and ethics laws are interpreted consistent with the intent of Congress;<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">file amicus curie briefs to support effective enforcement of campaign finance and ethics laws and to defend their constitutionality, where appropriate;<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">create a &#147;shadow&#148; board of experienced figures within the campaign finance community to review high-profile FEC cases and to reach an independent analysis and conclusion.  This analysis will serve as a cross-check on FEC actions and will offer the public an alternative view of how the law applies in individual cases.  </font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FEC Watch will rely on the Center&#146;s research and analysis of campaign finance figures to support the positions the project takes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>CRP is a non-partisan, non-profit research group based in Washington, D.C. that tracks money in politics and its effect on elections and public policy. The Center conducts computer-based research on campaign finance issues that is aimed at creating a more educated voter, an involved citizenry, and a more responsive government.</i></font></p>
