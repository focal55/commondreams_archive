- June 26 - Public Citizen and the Center for Food Safety today filed a false advertising complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against the SureBeam Corp., a prominent irradiation company whose Internet advertisements have told consumers that its food products have been &quot;electronically pasteurized&quot; instead of irradiated.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deceptive advertising is illegal under the U.S. Federal Trade Commission Act, and is punishable through criminal and civil penalties, including fines, court injunctions and corrective advertising.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Comparing irradiation to pasteurization is like comparing a heart attack to a hang nail. There is no comparison, and SureBeam executives know it,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;SureBeam must immediately stop flouting the law and start telling consumers the truth about irradiation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based in San Diego, SureBeam is one of the nation&#146;s largest and most high-profile food irradiation companies. Its clients include Cargill/Excel, Del Monte, Kraft, IBP, Omaha Steaks and Tyson Foods. A recently spun-off subsidiary of defense contractor Titan Corp., SureBeam &quot;treats&quot; food with linear accelerators originally designed for the Reagan-era Strategic Defense Initiative, or &quot;Star Wars&quot; program. SureBeam operates a so-called &quot;e-beam&quot; facility in Sioux City, Iowa, and is planning additional facilities near Chicago, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On two consecutive days in May, SureBeam ran ads on the widely read, Internet-based news service MEATingplace.com that promoted the company&#146;s &quot;electronically pasteurized foods.&quot; SureBeam uses the phrase &quot;electronically pasteurized&quot; in virtually all of its press releases and other corporate communications, but this is the first time the phrase has appeared in an ad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to SureBeam President Larry Oberkfell, Public Citizen and the Center for Food Safety has asked the company to ensure that future advertisements comply with federal law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the fourth complaint Public Citizen has filed this year against companies involved with food irradiation:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; On June 1, a false labeling complaint was filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) against Huisken Meats of Chandler, MN, because the company&#146;s new line of irradiated ground beef patties is improperly labeled. Public Citizen also requested the federal government to initiate a recall of the products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; On March 29, a false advertising complaint was filed with FTC against Omaha Steaks, because the company&#146;s catalog and Internet ads fail to tell consumers that its ground beef products have been irradiated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; On March 7, a false advertising complaint was filed with the FTC against Huisken Meats, because the company&#146;s Web site told consumers that its ground beef products had been &quot;electronically pasteurized&quot; instead of irradiated. (Huisken has since corrected its Web site.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The advertising and labeling of irradiated food has become an increasingly controversial issue as more irradiated products have reached the market in recent months. Federal law requires irradiated food to be labeled &quot;Treated by Irradiation&quot; or &quot;Treated with Radiation,&quot; but the law is under review by the FDA. The National Food Processors Association, whose leaders have called the word irradiation &quot;a pejorative term&quot; and &quot;an impediment to consumer acceptance,&quot; are lobbying the FDA and Congress to allow irradiated food to be labeled &quot;electronically pasteurized&quot; or &quot;cold pasteurized.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pasteurization and irradiation, however, are completely different processes. Pasteurization, which uses heat -- a form of non-ionizing radiation -- does not significantly alter the chemical structure of food. Irradiation, which uses electron beams, X-rays or gamma rays -- all forms of ionizing radiation -- significantly alters the chemical structure of food by breaking the molecular bonds that hold electrons in place. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, irradiation depletes vitamins, corrupts essential fatty acids and amino acids, and forms chemicals that are known or suspected to cause cancer and birth defects, such as benzene and methyl ethyl ketone. Research has revealed a wide range of serious health problems in animals fed irradiated food, including premature death, stillbirths, a rare form of cancer, fatal internal bleeding, genetic damage, organ malfunctions and vitamin deficiencies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen and the Center for Food Safety are working to stop the proliferation of irradiated food and food irradiation technology through coordinated campaigns, featuring grassroots organizing, citizen petitions, legal action and efforts to ensure companies are honest with consumers about the benefits and harms associated with irradiated food.</font></p>
