- April 16 - During morning rush hour in midtown Manhattan, 

          commuters were greeted with the sight of two activists unfurling a 20-foot 

          banner from flag poles outside of Citigroup&#146;s (Citi) headquarters 

          reading, &#147;Hey CITI, Not With My Money!&#148; The climbers were 

          drawing public attention to the growing controversy around Citi&#146;s 

          leading role in financing environmentally and socially destructive projects 

          around the globe. 

        </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today&#146;s event follows on the heels of the launch of a student 

          led boycott against Citi credit cards and protests in more than 80 cities 

          in 12 countries last Wednesday, April 11th. Growing ranks of students 

          and shareholders are joining the campaign to demand that Citi adopt 

          comprehensive environmental and social criteria throughout their lending 

          and trading business.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;With only 22 percent of primary forests intact on the planet, 

          there are certain activities we can longer afford to fund,&#148; said 

          Ilyse Hogue of the Rainforest Action Network. &#147;More and more Citi 

          customers are outraged by the bank&#146;s leading role in profiting 

          off rainforest destruction, global warming and the displacement of indigenous 

          peoples.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The climbers were David Murphy, 28 of Brooklyn and Scott Anderson, 

          27 of Kentucky. Mr. Murphy commented, &#147;Citi has a consistent record 

          of prioritizing short term profits at the expense of long term health 

          of communities and the environment. I am here to send a clear message 

          that Citi can no longer fund immoral and destructive activities with 

          MY money.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives from Rainforest Action Network on site today pointed 

          to several examples of the company&#146;s involvement in egregious projects, 

          including mining in the fragile Amazon basin, constructing oil pipelines 

          through indigenous land in Venezuela and expanding palm plantations 

          in critical habitat of endangered orangutans in Indonesia. Protesters 

          also highlighted Citi&#146;s policies of redlining in communities and 

          &#145;predatory lending&#146; in urban areas that disproportionately 

          affect economically disadvantaged people and target communities of color.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international campaign targeting Citigroup is working to transform 

          the funding practices of the corporate financial system. The campaign 

          is calling for Citigroup as America&#146;s largest financial institution, 

          to become an industry leader in integrating social and environmental 

          criteria into its investment decision-making. Rainforest Action Network 

          calls for an immediate ban on funding development projects that result 

          in the destruction of primary forests worldwide and a prioritization 

          of lending for renewable energies and tree-free lumber and paper alternatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A broad coalition of groups, including Rainforest Action Network, NY 

          National Organization of Women, Inner City on the Move, and United for 

          a Fair Economy, will continue their vigilant protest at Citi&#146;s 

          shareholder meeting tomorrow morning, April 17 at Carnegie Hall.</font></p>
