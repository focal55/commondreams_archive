- November 5 - Environmentalists are urging governments at international climate negotiations in Morocco to support an ambitious project to help tackle poverty and fight climate change, by providing renewable energy to more than two billion people globally. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today delegates will begin the process of deciding what climate protection measures to recommend to the WSSD. Climate Action Network, a global coalition of more than 200 environmental non-government organizations including Greenpeace, is urging countries to use the opportunity the U.N. has provided them to support the massive expansion of renewable energy globally. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace and international retail chain The Body Shop launched the Choose Positive Energy campaign in June this year aimed at providing renewable energy to two billion people by 2012. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Two billion people around the world - one in three of us - have no access to reliable sources of energy to meet the basic needs of life such as cooking, clean water, lighting, or power for health centers and schools,&quot; said Greenpeace campaigner Paul Horsman. &quot;This is as unacceptable as it is intolerable - we can and must provide sustainable energy sources to provide for these basic needs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that developing countries are most threatened by climate change - water supplies, agriculture and health are all threatened. Much of this threat can be avoided with a massive and committed global expansion of renewable energy supplies, which at the same time will help prevent dangerous climate change. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's not just environment groups that want to see this,&quot; said Horsman. &quot;The G8 Task Force has called for an expansion of renewable energy to assist in mitigating climate change and air pollution, alleviating poverty and increasing quality of life, especially in developing countries.&quot;</font></p>
