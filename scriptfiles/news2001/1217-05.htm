<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- December 17 - Today the nation's number two forest official issued a

precedent-setting decision that could greatly impact America's National

Forests.  Agriculture Department Undersecretary Mark Rey, a former top

timber industry lobbyist, approved logging on 46,000 acres of forest on

Montana's Bitteroot National Forest ? threatening prime habitat for the

imperiled bull trout and other wildlife.  By signing off on the proposed

timber sale the Undersecretary removed the ability of citizens to file

appeals on the project and insures that the Forest Service will be taken to

court.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration is chopping away at the basic laws that protect

our National Forests from unchecked logging and other development,&quot; said

Melanie Griffin, director of the Sierra Club's Land Protection Program. &quot;We

call on Undersecretary Mark Rey to listen to the American public and

protect our National Forests for future generations, not sacrifice them for

short term industry profit.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Burned Area Recovery&quot; timber sale, the largest salvage logging project

in the history of the Forest Service, is designed to log portions of the

Bitteroot National Forest that were burned in the summer of 2000.  The

Forest Service wants to log more than 181 million board feet from the burnt

forest despite opposition from local citizens and scientific evidence that

shows logging increases sediment in streams.  Downed and burned trees

reduce erosion, enrich the soil and provide habitat for woodpeckers and

other wildlife. A significant portion of the timber sale is planned for

previously unroaded areas that provide habitat for the threatened bull

trout.  Also, allowing natural processes in burnt forests increases the

ability of the forest to recover.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This project will cause impacts that affect the forest for years to come

and ignores the 4400 citizen comments that opposed the timber sale,&quot; said

Jennifer Ferenstein, President of the Sierra Club and a Montanan.  &quot;This

decision gives the concerned citizen no other alternative than to take the

Forest Service to court.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another move today, Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth issued a

directive to unravel protections for our undeveloped wild areas in National

Forests, allowing new, destructive development and logging in 58.5 million

acres of unspoiled forests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent months, the Forest Service has released a series of policy

changes that severely undermine protections for National Forests. Recent

directives have opened the door to logging in roadless areas of the Tongass

National Forest, the largest remaining temperate rainforest on earth and

home to grizzly bears and wild salmon.   Another recent proposal would make

it easier for the Forest Service to use a loophole called &quot;categorical

exclusions&quot; to fast-track destructive logging projects?even if the logging

will harm endangered species or spoil a wild forest roadless area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Road construction is particularly damaging to forests. Of the 440,000 miles

of roads in the National Forest System, only 20 percent of these receive

regular maintenance.  These roads dump sediment into streams, cause damage

to fish and wildlife habitat and increase the cost of water filtration for

towns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of listening to the two million public comments in favor of fully

protecting wild forests, the Forest Service is opening the door to the

timber industry to trash our nation's forests for private profit,&quot; said

Griffin.   &quot;The least the Forest Service could do is protect these last

wild areas of our National Forests.&quot;
