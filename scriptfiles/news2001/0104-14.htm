- January 4 - California's 

    Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved a plan today that will allow 

    Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) and Southern California Edison to raise 

    their electricity rates by 7 percent to 15 percent. The rate hike is an &quot;interim&quot; 

    increase that will be in effect for the next 90 days. The proposal was roundly 

    criticized by community advocates because consumers served by these utilities 

    were supposed to be protected from such rate increases under the state's 1996 

    electricity deregulation law. Consumer advocates also fear that this will 

    be the first of many rate increases the utilities will seek.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the plan approved today, 

    residential consumers will face a nine percent hike, small businesses will 

    pay seven percent more, medium size businesses' rates will go up by twelve 

    percent, and large industrial customer's rates will climb by 15 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Four years ago, consumers 

    were promised a ten percent rate reduction under the state's deregulation 

    law,&quot; said Harry Snyder, Senior Advocate for Consumers Union's West Coast 

    Regional Office in San Francisco. &quot;Today they are being socked with a 

    nine percent rate hike and could face even higher increases in the future. 

    Consumers shouldn't have to foot the bill for a flawed deregulation scheme 

    designed by the utility lobbyists now that it's gone bust.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Under the 1996 deregulation 

    law, consumers were forced to bail out the utilities to the tune of $20 billion,&quot; 

    said Snyder. &quot;There shouldn't be another bailout of PG&amp;E and Edison 

    because the utilities gambled with the market and lost. Bailing out and subsidizing 

    these companies sends the wrong signal to the marketplace that the state will 

    pay for problems the companies may create in the future. Losses should be 

    borne by the utilities' shareholders and creditors not customers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers Union has called on Governor 

    Gray Davis and state lawmakers to take necessary steps to guarantee an adequate 

    power supply to meet residential needs sufficient to prevent price gouging. 

    Specifically, the group has recommended that the state should:</font></p>

<ul>

  

<li> 

    

<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Require that 

      all power generated in the state (by PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E and So. Cal Edison) 

      is dedicated to meet the needs of homeowners, renters and small businesses 

      at prices based on the actual cost to produce the power allowing a reasonable 

      rate of return, subject to control by the PUC. This will stabilize prices 

      for California ratepayers at lower prices than they now face and protect 

      consumers from price gouging by out-of-state suppliers. <br>

      </font></div>

</li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Take over the California Independent 

    Systems Operator and the California Power Exchange to obtain state ownership 

    and management of our transmission capacity<br>

    </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Provide Californians who are 

    on fixed incomes, retirees and low-income consumers with additional financial 

    assistance to help with increased electric/utility bills and to exchange old 

    outdated inefficient appliances with modern appliances that will conserve 

    energy, keep bills down and free up more electricity to meet the whole state's 

    needs<br>

    </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Invest in energy statewide demand 

    reduction and efficiency programs to stabilize prices and maintain an emergency 

    reserve of electricity to prevent blackouts.<br>

    </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Encourage cleaner burning new 

    power plants and renewable energy development to meet the growing demand for 

    electricity by providing state matching grants, financial support, and / or 

    loan guarantees to public and private power developers willing to enter into 

    contracts to provide affordable electricity to residential customers.<br>

    </font></li>

<li> 

    

<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Require utilities 

      to implement a five-year plan to restore the state's energy self-sufficiency 

      and toughen law enforcement to police price gouging by increasing funding 

      for the Attorney General's anti-trust and investigative units.</font></div>

</li>

</ul>

<div align="left"> 

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now that it's clear that 

    deregulation has been an unmitigated disaster for California, Governor Davis 

    and the state's lawmakers must work together to stem this crisis,&quot; consumers,&quot; 

    said Snyder. &quot;We need bold leadership from Sacramento to protect consumers 

    from greedy price gouging by energy suppliers and to chart a long-term plan 

    to restore the state's energy self-sufficiency.&quot; </font></p>
