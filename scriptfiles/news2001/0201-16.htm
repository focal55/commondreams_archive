- February 1 - In 1999, the discovery of bodies in the Kosovo village of Racak

helped push NATO into war.  New evidence casting doubt on claims that the

bodies were civilian victims of a massacre has stirred debate in the

European media -- but there has been a virtual blackout on the news in the

U.S. press.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        In January of 1999, the American head of the Organization for

Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission in Kosovo announced that

45 Kosovar Albanians from the village of Racak had been massacred by Serb

soldiers. U.S. diplomat William Walker condemned the killings as a

&quot;horrendous&quot; massacre, stating that the dead were all civilians who had been

brutally executed, many of them mutilated after death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Once the massacre story was reported in heart-wrenching detail by

media across the globe, pressure for war intensified and previously

reluctant European allies took a major step toward authorizing airstrikes. A

Washington Post article (4/18/99) reconstructing the Kosovo decision-making

process found that &quot;Racak transformed the West's Balkan policy as singular

events seldom do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Troubling questions soon emerged, however, about whether or not

there had actually been a massacre at Racak, or whether the incident had

been manipulated to push NATO into war-- questions almost completely ignored

by the U.S. media at the time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Front-page news articles by veteran Yugoslavia correspondents

questioning William Walker's account were published in French newspapers

like Le Figaro (&quot;Dark Clouds Over a Massacre,&quot; 1/20/99) and Le Monde (&quot;Were

the Dead in Racak Really Massacred in Cold Blood?,&quot; 1/21/99). The German

daily Berliner Zeitung reported in March (3/13/99) that several European

governments, including Germany and Italy, were pressing the OSCE to fire

William Walker based on information from OSCE monitors in Kosovo that the

Racak bodies &quot;were not-- as Walker declared-- victims of a Serbian massacre

of civilians,&quot; but were mostly KLA fighters killed in battle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        The Sunday Times of London (3/12/00) reported that Walker's team of

American observers was covertly working with the CIA, pursuing a policy

intended to push NATO into war. &quot;European diplomats then working for the

OSCE claim it was betrayed by an American policy that made airstrikes

inevitable,&quot; the Sunday Times reported.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        After the massacre, the European Union hired a Finnish team of

forensic pathologists to investigate the deaths. Their report was kept

secret until now, two years later. The U.S. media is ignoring the story,

despite the report's finding that although people did indeed die at Racak,

there is no evidence of a massacre.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        According to the Berliner Zeitung (1/16/01), the Finnish

investigators could not establish that the victims were civilians, whether

they were from Racak, or even exactly where they had been killed.

Furthermore, the investigators found only one body that showed traces of an

execution-style killing, and no evidence at all that the bodies had been

mutilated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        The Berliner Zeitung also reports that these findings were completed

as early as June 2000, but that their publication had been blocked by the UN

and the EU.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        Except for one brief wire story from United Press International

(1/18/01), not a single U.S. media outlet has run a story on the Finnish

team's findings. News outlets continue to refer to the Racak massacre

without qualification, despite the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the

story.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        A recent Chicago Tribune report (1/23/01) about the Albanian

separatist militia in southern Serbia speculated that the Serbs might

&quot;revert to form and respond to an Albanian provocation with a Racak-style

retaliation.&quot; (The KLA-linked militia, called the UCPMB, are reportedly

preparing for a new war and recently fired on British KFOR troops-- London

Guardian, 1/26/01.) The Tribune made no mention of any questions surrounding

the Racak incident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        A recent Philadelphia Inquirer story (1/23/01) about Yugoslavia's

relationship with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague claimed that &quot;Serbs

refuse to accept the world's vision of them as aggressors,&quot; and noted that

Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica &quot;alleges the killings [at Racak] were

staged to look like a massacre to embarrass Yugoslavia.&quot; The Finnish team's

findings about Racak, which prompted Kostunica's recent allegations, went

unmentioned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        An Associated Press article (1/18/01) did elliptically note the new

report's existence, reporting that Kostunica wants to discuss with The Hague

&quot;reports attributed to Finnish pathologists saying there was no evidence of

a Serb massacre&quot; at Racak (1/18/01).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        With tensions in southern Serbia mounting and fears of a new Kosovo

war escalating daily, the U.S. media's silence on this story is troubling.
