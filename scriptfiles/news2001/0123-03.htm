<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DULUTH, MINN - January 23 - Each day, more than 1,000 girls become regular smokers. Roughly

one third will die prematurely because of smoking. But tobacco

companies still spend billions on ads in magazines read by teens

and pre-teens in violation of the agreement settling states'

lawsuits against the industry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national advocacy group Dads and Daughters (DADs) uses the

Internet and grassroots activism to pressure marketers who

undermine girls to sell their products, and also to spotlight and

strengthen positive messages. Now, fathers across the country are

sending messages of support to the SmokeFree Action Network for its

groundbreaking work educating young people about the danger of

nicotine addiction. In a letter to SAN president Joseph Cherner,

DADs wrote:



</font></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"As a group of fathers and daughters, we take very seriously the

ways in which marketers approach our children. It is particularly

disturbing to see how widespread and 'normalized' is the notion

that younger and younger girls should be concerned about their

weight or looking a particular way to attract attention from boys.

More and more, this phenomenon is becoming "normative" for our

sons, too.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Tobacco advertising has long pushed cigarettes as a path to

being 'cool,' and no age group is more susceptible to this

dangerous message as the highly pursued youth demographic. These

are not strangers or statistics. They are our daughters -- and

sons. And too often, big tobacco is targeting these potential new

customers when they're still just children."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The SmokeFree Action Network has received national attention for

innovative counter-advertising created by New York City

schoolchildren and placed on taxis and in subway cars. Their Web

site (<a href="http://www.smokefreeair.org">www.smokefreeair.org</a>)

facilitates letter writing between

smoke-free advocates and key decision-makers through "e-z letters"

faxed to lawmakers and others. DADs encourages all parents to use

the SAN Web site and voice their support for SAN. E-mail

Joe@smokefree.org; write P.O. Box 3316, New York, NY 10008; fax

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Dads and Daughters is the national non-profit membership group

for fathers and daughters. DADs helps strengthen father-daughter

relationships and transform the pervasive messages that value girls

more for how they look than who they are. Most recently, DADs

convinced Campbell's Soup to pull a TV commercial that marketed

Campbell's Soup to young children as a weight control food. For
