Founded in 1917 to provide conscientious objectors with an opportunity

to aid civilian victims during World War I, AFSC is grounded in

Quaker beliefs respecting the dignity and worth of every person.

AFSC has programs in the United States, and in Africa, Asia, Latin

America, and the Middle East that focus on issues related to economic

justice, peace-building and demilitarization, social justice,

and youth. In 1947, the AFSC and the British Friends Service Council

received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the Religious Society

of Friends, for humanitarian service, work for reconciliation,

and the spirit in which these were carried out.
