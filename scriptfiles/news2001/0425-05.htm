- April 25 - A front-page article in today's <I>Washington Post</I> reports that the CIA was late in warning the Peruvian military not to fire on the civilian airplane carrying missionaries.

The following analysts are available for interviews on broader U.S. policy

questions:

<P><LI>CECILIA ZARATE-LAUN, <A HREF="mailto:csn@igc.org">

Co-founder and director of the Colombia Support Network, Zarate-Laun said today: "The

downing of the airplane in Peru makes more public the level of U.S. military

presence in the Amazon area, which is rich in natural resources. The U.S.

government is selling its 'war on drugs' to the American people as its solution

to voracious drug consumption. But when we look carefully at what is happening

on the supply side of the issue, more and more doubts come to our minds when we

see how the war is implemented in Colombia. The U.S. is focusing Plan Colombia

on the south of the country, where the guerillas are strong, while ignoring the

'paramilitaries' in the north, even though they are responsible for much more

of the drug trafficking. Once the paramilitaries enter a town, they kill the

community leaders so that democracy does not flourish. Three out of every five

unionists killed around the world today are Colombian. Plan Colombia is more a

war against the guerrillas to ensure that U.S. corporate interests will

dominate Colombia, which is key strategically, than a war against drugs. It is

costing $1.36 billion, 80 percent of which is military. It goes to the

Colombian military, to the police and for fumigation of the rainforest. Very

little of Plan Colombia goes to addressing the real problems; the peasants

plant coca because they are desperate and, given their circumstances, few other

crops are profitable."

coha@coha.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.coha.org">www.coha.org</A><BR>

Director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, Birns said today: "One speculates how Bush

nominees Otto Reich (as assistant secretary of state for inter-American

affairs) and Roger Noriega (as ambassador to the Organization of American

States) would have responded to the downing of the U.S. missionary aircraft in

Peru. Their past record far from guarantees that they would have been

forthcoming with a constructive and proportionate response to this tragedy....

Many believe that Reich only narrowly missed the prospect of doing hard jail

time for illegal behavior during the Iran-Contra conspiracy, while Noriega's

story represents a triumph of sycophancy and mediocrity over merit. Although

Secretary of State Colin Powell is well aware that the Reich and Noriega

nominations each could be a can of worms waiting to embarrass him, their names

will be sent to the Hill due to Sen. Jesse Helms' clout, and in the case of

Reich, due to the personal backing of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the pressure on

the governor -- which he passed onto his brother -- being applied by one of the

more hard-line Miami leaders, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL)..."
