- February 1 - The 

                    Chair of the &quot;Large Optics&quot; Subcommittee - a critical 

                    area of performance uncertainty for the NIF - was Michel Andre, 

                    a senior scientist in the French Megajoule laser project who 

                    has extensive contractual relations and engages in joint efforts 

                    with the NIF program. Were he to have been critical of NIF, 

                    and its optics component, his own program and career would 

                    have been adversely affected.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two other 

                    subcommittee members, John Emmett and E. Perry Wallerstein, 

                    are former senior laser program officials at the Livermore 

                    lab, and longstanding paid consultants to the Livermore laboratory. 

                    The fourth member of the subcommittee, Dr. Michelle Shinn, 

                    works at DOE's Thomas Jefferson Laboratory in Virginia, whose 

                    Director, Dr. Hermann Grunder, until recently chaired Livermore's 

                    NIF Programs Review Committee, one of the bodies found most 

                    responsible for failing to exert adequate oversight of the 

                    project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two employees 

                    of Dr. Grunder's at the Thomas Jefferson Laboratory - George 

                    Neil and Andrew Hutton - chaired the subcommittees reviewing 

                    the NIF's &quot;Line Replaceable Units&quot; and &quot;Assembly, 

                    Installation, and Commissioning. Each of these subpanels also 

                    included a member - Drs. Robert McCrory and Steve Loucks, 

                    respectively - from the University of Rochester's Laboratory 

                    for Laser Energetics, a major Livermore subcontractor and 

                    scientific collaborator on the NIF Project. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Documents 

                    obtained by co-plaintiff Tri-Valley CAREs reveal that McCrory 

                    and Loucks are also signatories on Livermore NIF subcontracts 

                    with the University of Rochester worth millions of dollars. 

                    According to an affidavit filed by TVC's executive director, 

                    Marylia Kelley, the group has in its possession 47 records, 

                    including NIF subcontracts, contract modifications, schedules, 

                    and sole source awards, that were signed by McCrory and Loucks 

                    or show them as managers or executors for the contracts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. McCrory 

                    has also been a paid individual consultant to the Laboratory 

                    Director's Office and to the lab's National Ignition Facility 

                    Program Directorate since 1996, and, according to copies of 

                    contracts obtained by NRDC under the California Public Records 

                    Act, entered into a new contract to consult on the NIF only 

                    weeks after his service on the Rebaseline Committee. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The panel 

                    on NIF assembly also included another longtime paid private 

                    consultant to Livermore - Dr. Damon Giovanielli - who had 

                    served only a few months earlier as the chair of the NIF Project's 

                    own &quot;Target Physics Program Review Committee,&quot; which 

                    had concluded, &quot;NIF should be completed to its full 192-beam 

                    configuration.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According 

                    to the declarations put before the court by Paine and Kelley, 

                    other members of the Rebaseline Committee had similar conflicts. 

                    Dr. John Peoples and James Renfro were under contract with 

                    the Livermore lab to provide consulting services at the time 

                    of the review, and Eugene Desaulniers had been a paid consultant 

                    to the NIF Project as recently as October 1998. William Barletta, 

                    of DOE's Lawrence Berkeley Lab, had previously been tapped 

                    by NIF management to promote the project in Congressional 

                    meetings.<br>

                    <b>Corrupting the Advisory Process<br>

                    </b>&quot;Additional facts surrounding the Rebaseline Review 

                    are very telling,&quot; says NRDC researcher Christopher Paine, 

                    &quot;because they reveal the extent to which DOE is willing 

                    to abuse the 'independent' advisory process for purely political 

                    purposes.&quot; Before Congress had received the Rebaseline 

                    Review and other reports purporting to document the Secretary's 

                    &quot;certification&quot; of the new $3.5 billion &quot;baseline&quot; 

                    NIF construction cost, and before Congress had the opportunity 

                    to consider lesser configurations for the facility, DOE preemptively 

                    awarded a $230 million cost-plus- award-fee contract on August 

                    31, 2000 to the Jacobs Engineering Group to install the full 

                    192-beam laser infrastructure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 

                    'independent review' supporting the Secretary's certification 

                    of the NIF, prepared by a year long &quot;NIF Task Force&quot; 

                    of the DOE's main FACA committee - the Secretary of Energy's 

                    Advisory Board (SEAB) - was not included in the Congressional 

                    certification package because it had not been considered and 

                    approved by the full SEAB for transmission to the Secretary. 

                    &quot;To fill this gap,&quot; Paine said, &quot;the chairman 

                    of the NIF Task Force wrote a letter, on SEAB letterhead, 

                    directly to the Secretary of Energy, summarizing his view 

                    of the favorable conclusions reached by the Task Force, and 

                    Secretary Richardson then submitted this letter - a FACA violation 

                    -- to Congress as part of his NIF certification package.&quot; 

                    </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the 

                    full SEAB eventually submitted the NIF Task Force's Final 

                    Report to the Secretary of Energy -- on November 27, 2000, 

                    well after Congress had approved NIF funding for 2001 -- it 

                    was accompanied by a letter of dissent from three members 

                    of the full SEAB who concluded, &quot;We cannot endorse 'completion' 

                    of a $4 billion project irrespective of its ability to perform 

                    its intended missions.&quot;</font></p>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A self-described 

                    'key finding' of the NIF Task Force Report is that periodic 

                    reviews of progress, similar to the illegal August 2000 review 

                    conducted at Livermore, should &quot;be conducted throughout 

                    the life of the project.&quot; According to Paine, this suggests 

                    that DOE is &quot;not only failing to acknowledge past FACA 

                    violations in its reviews of NIF, but apparently intends to 

                    continue these violations - hence the need for judicial intervention 

                    to protect the public interest.&quot; </font></p>
