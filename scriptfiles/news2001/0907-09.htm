<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 7 -  As international delegates gather in New York for a conference 

on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Bush 

Administration has indicated that the only options for attendance 

at the conference are a 'junior' delegation or none at all. This 

irresponsible action would send a host of dangerous messages to our 

world partners in the very dangerous game of nuclear weapons 

proliferation. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposal to send no U.S. representatives to the CTBT 

conference at the United Nations on Sept. 25-27 continues a 

campaign by this administration to scuttle a treaty signed by this 

nation and 160 others and ratified by 79 nations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a sneak attack over the Labor Day holiday, the Bush 

Administration took a huge step towards compromising the treaty by 

signaling that there wouldn't be objections to a resumption of 

nuclear testing by China. In addition, the new American Ambassador to India has said that the U.S. will not be a &quot;nagging nanny&quot; on 

the nuclear issue, which seems to indicate that we will abandon 

sanctions imposed on India since their 1998 series of nuclear 

tests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nuclear proliferation is acknowledged to be a major threat to 

U.S. and global security,&quot; said Martin Butcher, director of 

security programs for Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR). &quot;Achieving a test ban has been a bipartisan U.S. policy goal for over 40 years, and sabotaging this conference is a dangerous and 

disgraceful act.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of the second conference on entry-into-force of the 

CTBT is to promote the treaty and to examine ways to encourage 

signature and ratification. The first such conference was held in 

1999. All U.S. allies in NATO have signed and ratified the treaty, 

as has Russia. The U.S. has signed, but not ratified the treaty. It 

now enjoys the unique company of such diplomatic pariahs as China, 

Libya and Iraq in its attitude to the CTBT. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no conceivable way that encouraging nuclear testing 

and thus promoting proliferation is in the security interests of 

the United States,&quot; said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H., executive 

director and CEO of PSR. &quot;The U.S. decision to openly flaunt this 

treaty can yield only one outcome: a continued return to the 

darkest days of nuclear fear during the Cold War.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H. and Martin Butcher are 

available for interviews. </i></font></p>
