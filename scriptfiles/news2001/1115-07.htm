<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 15 - A coalition of leading

women's health care advocates called today for the United States

Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) to revise their Ethical and

Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services (Directives)

and end their ban on voluntary female sterilization at Catholic and

Catholic-affiliated hospitals. The coalition's call was contained

in a letter to Bishop Wilton Gregory, who was just elected

president of the USCCB at its fall 2001 meeting, which closes today

in Washington, DC. Fifteen organizations, including women's health,

rights, and research groups, cited a review of 150 hospital mergers

in the past decade that has identified at least 40 non-Catholic

hospitals that had merged with Catholic hospitals and now face

having to comply with the Directives and stop providing female

sterilization to thousands of women, many of them poor.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coalition offered to work with the USCCB to design a

solution to preserve voluntary sterilization in all mergers between

Catholic and non-Catholic hospitals. They appealed to the bishops'

to adhere to their position on providing equitable health care for

all, particularly low-income people who cannot afford health

insurance.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Surely a pastoral exception can be made to allow non-Catholic

hospitals in partnership with Catholic hospitals to provide a

health care service that is so needed and vital, especially for

low-income women. Such a exception would also allow the millions

of Catholic and non-Catholic women who choose sterilization each

year to exercise their freedom of conscience at the hospital of

their choice, in their community."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to pressure from the Vatican, the bishops had voted

to revise the Directives in June 2001, putting sterilization on par

with abortion and euthanasia as an "intrinsically immoral" service

and banning the procedure at all Catholic and Catholic-affiliated

hospitals. Non-Catholic hospitals across the country are now

struggling to find ways to avoid complying with the Directives and

to continue to provide tubal ligation, a service that is one of the

most affordable and safest methods of contraception.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bishop Wilton Gregory

<br>

President

<br>

United States Conference of Catholic Bishops

<br>

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Bishop Gregory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As organizations dedicated to the health and well-being of

women, we respectfully ask the United States Conference of Catholic

Bishops to reconsider its June 2001 decision to revise the Ethical

and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services

("Directives") as they relate to the provision of sterilization for

women. The revised Directives strictly limit the ability of

non-Catholic hospitals that have merged with Catholic hospitals to

provide voluntary female sterilization. As a result, thousands of

women, most of them poor, will be deprived of an essential health

service option.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A review by Catholics for a Free Choice of the approximately 150

hospital mergers in the past decade has identified 40 such

situations in which sterilization services were preserved but are

now jeopardized by the revised Directives. We can also confirm

that several of these hospitals, like Sierra Nevada Memorial

Hospital in Grass Valley, CA, are the only hospitals providing

sterilization services for women in the area.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preserving the option of voluntary female sterilization in such

hospital mergers would be consistent with the United States

Conference of Catholic Bishops' persistent calls for equitable

health care for all, particularly low-income people who cannot

afford health insurance. It would also be consistent with the

wishes of the communities that insisted as a condition for

approving the merger of a non-Catholic hospital with a Catholic

hospital that voluntary sterilization continue to be offered. The

citizens of these communities recognized that female

sterilization-one of the most affordable and safest methods of

contraception- is a service that women cannot do without.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, female sterilization

is the most commonly used form of contraception in the United

States. For couples who have completed their families, for women

who cannot use other forms of contraception for health reasons, and

for women whose lives or health would be endangered by another

pregnancy and require certainty about their method of

contraception, sterilization is an important option.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surely a pastoral exception can be made to allow non-Catholic

hospitals in partnership with Catholic hospitals to provide a

health care service that is so needed and vital, especially for

low-income women. Such an exception would also allow the millions

of Catholic and non-Catholic women who choose sterilization each

year to exercise their freedom of conscience at the hospital of

their choice, in their community. At the same time, we remain

concerned about arrangements that restrict access to women's health

service.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would be happy to work with the United States Conference of

Catholic Bishops to design a solution that would preserve voluntary

sterilization services in all mergers between Catholic and

non-Catholic hospitals nationwide.
