- April 26 -  A new report finds that American taxpayers will be liable 

                    for

                    between $250 million and $1.1 billion in potential clean up 

                    costs at active

                    U.S. metals mines if the Bush Administration rolls back current 

                    mining regulations. The finding does not include the estimated 

                    $32-72 billion price tag to clean up already abandoned mines. 

                    The report, <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/greenscissors/LearnMore/publiclands/mining/PassingTheBuck.PDF">Passing 

                    the

                    Buck</a>, released today by the <a href="http://www.mineralpolicy.org" target="_blank">Mineral 

                    Policy Center </a>and <a href="http://www.taxpayer.net/mock_home.htm">Taxpayers 

                    for Common

                    Sense</a>, uses federal and state government data and bonding 

                    formulas to

                    determine the liability to taxpayers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A 

                    Bush reversal would force taxpayers to write a blank check 

                    for mining

                    cleanups,&quot; said Jill Lancelot, Legislative Director of 

                    Taxpayers for Common

                    Sense. &quot;This is corporate welfare at its worst.&quot;</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Companies 

                    are required to post bonds with the federal government before

                    mining can begin on public lands. These bonds cover clean 

                    up costs if a

                    company lacks the money to do it themselves. Passing the Buck 

                    illustrates

                    how the weak bonding requirements in old regulations that 

                    the Bush

                    administration is actively seeking to reinstate allow companies 

                    to pass

                    their cleanup costs onto taxpayers.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If 

                    the Bush Administration rolls back these hard fought improvements 

                    to

                    mining regulations, they are saying that taxpayers, rather 

                    than mining

                    companies, should pay for cleanup costs,&quot; continued Lancelot.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 

                    23, the Department of the Interior announced that it wanted 

                    to

                    revoke current rules governing mining on public lands, the 

                    product of an

                    extensive four-year rulemaking process that ended November 

                    21, 2000. The

                    current rules require companies to post adequate financial 

                    bonds for cleanup

                    before mining commences, closing the loophole that had allowed 

                    mining

                    companies to paying for environmental protection and remediation 

                    at mines.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mining 

                    companies routinely go bankrupt just as they extract the last 

                    ounce

                    of ore from their mines leaving little or no money for clean 

                    up,&quot; said

                    Stephen D'Esposito, President of Mineral Policy Center. &quot;Bonding 

                    is the most

                    important protection taxpayers have against being left holding 

                    the bag when

                    a mining company goes under and leaves behind a mountains 

                    of toxic mining

                    waste that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean 

                    up.&quot;</font></p>
