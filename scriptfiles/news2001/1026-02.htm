<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- October 26 - Anti-terrorism 

legislation that includes fundamental changes to our nation's 

immigration law has passed the House and Senate and is about to be 

signed into law. The American Immigration Lawyers Association 

(AILA), the national association of more than 7,500 practicing 

immigration attorneys, is concerned that implementation of the new 

law preserve the important balance between security and liberties 

that is so fundamental to our democracy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The broad new powers contained in this legislation must be used 

wisely and judiciously, to prosecute real terrorists. We must 

ensure that neither innocent people nor the Constitution be 

trampled as this important criminal investigation proceeds,&quot; said 

Jeanne Butterfield, AILA's executive director. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We commend Representatives John Conyers (D-Mich.) and James 

Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), and Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Edward 

Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Sam Brownback (R-Kansas) for their efforts 

to ameliorate some of the worse aspects of the antiterrorism 

legislation that were included in the proposal that the Bush 

administration sent to Congress just a few weeks ago.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notwithstanding these efforts, the measure that the President 

will sign into law includes several troubling provisions. The new 

law casts such a broad net that it will allow for the detention an&lt;&quot;eportation 

of people engaging in innocent associational activity 

and Constitutionally protected speech, and permit the indefinite 

detention of immigrants and non-citizens who are not terrorists. 

AILA will be working with Congress to develop oversight hearings to 

monitor the impacts of the new law and develop appropriate 

strategies and responses. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is important to develop effective responses that will deter 

terrorism and enhance our nation's security,&quot; Butterfield 

continued. &quot;These responses must reflect the fact that we are 

nation of immigrants and a country with a Constitution that upholds 

individual rights and liberties-these are the things that make us 

unique as a nation. We cannot compromise our security or our 

values.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we craft responses to the terrorist threat, we must be wary 

of false and harmful solutions to real problems,&quot; said Butterfield. 

&quot;We need to respond in ways that isolate terrorists, not America, 

recognize that existing laws and procedures offer us significant 

protections, and add to our deterrence capabilities by increasing 

our intelligence capacities.&quot; These proposals include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Increased funding for the Department of State and the 

Immigration and Naturalization Service to help these agencies 

enhance their technological capacities. Such funding needs to come 

from direct Congressional appropriations, not from user fees. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The use of new technologies to achieve the most reliable 

means of verifying identity. The federal government needs to fund 

the development and use of these new technologies and make sure 

various federal agencies coordinate compatible efforts in this 

area. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Improved access to lookout lists by U.S. federal agencies, as 

well as international law enforcement officials. We also must 

include safeguards against potential abuse of this data that would 

limit the re-dissemination of such information, ensure the security 

and confidentiality of such information, protect privacy rights of 

individuals subject to such information, and establish procedures 

that determine who stays on and is removed from these lists. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Provision of accurate and timely intelligence information to 

U.S. consulates abroad that are our nation's first line of defense. 

We must ensure that U.S. consulates have the necessary intelligence 

information and the technological capacity to use intelligence 

information. We also need to upgrade the status of the consular 

officer who has the all-important job of assessing whether someone 

should be allowed to enter the U.S. This decision needs to be 

reviewable. In these times of heightened scrutiny, such review is 

vital to ensure the integrity of the system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Expansion of U.S. pre-inspections programs to other airports 

to increase the likelihood of a more thorough check. Such 

pre-inspections would move our system from one that focuses on a 

person's point-of-entry to one that focuses on their point of 

origin. Any pre-inspection system must make adequate provision for 

genuine refugees to seek asylum protection. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- All airlines should transmit passenger lists to the 

destination airport to be checked against the lookout list. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Multilateral strategies should be pursued with Canada and 

Mexico to further enhance our security and to create a North 

American Perimeter Safety Zone. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Our nation must ensure adequate personnel and technological 

improvements at and between our ports of entry. We need to enhance 

our data gathering at airports by mandating an entry/exit system 

that would collect and correlate data about arrivals and 

departures. A 1998 Senate report found that such a system at land 

borders would contribute little to our security, and would be 

exceedingly disruptive to commerce. </font></p>
