- March 1 - The National Organization for Women

is declaring a state of emergency to save women's rights to self-determination

and reproductive freedom.&nbsp;

NOW is calling on activists everywhere to take part in a national campaign

which we will kick off with an Emergency Action

for Women's Lives in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, April 22.

<p>The Emergency Action for Women's Lives will target the U.S. Senate to

protect our rights and to stop the packing of the U.S.

Supreme Court with anti-abortion rights nominees. The Action will cap

two weeks of in-state lobbying during the Senate's spring break from April

7 through 22. It will include virtual lobbying to inundate Senators with

e-mails when they return to the nation's capital.

<p>NOW is proud to stand with allies who join in the call for this emergency

campaign: the <a href="http://www.feminist.org">Feminist Majority</a>,

<a href="http://www.ppfa.org">Planned

Parenthood Federation of America</a>, the <a href="http://www.naral.org">National

Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League</a>, the <a href="http://www.nbwhp.org/">National

Black Women's Health Project</a>, <a href="http://www.cath4choice.org">Catholics

for a Free Choice</a>, the <a href="http://www.nawho.org">National Asian

Women's Health Organization</a>, the <a href="http://www.amwa-doc.org/index.html">American

Medical Women's Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.crlp.org">Center

for Reproductive Law and Policy</a>. All of us feel the same sense of urgency

and the imminence of the dangers and the full extent of the threats to

our rights posed by the Bush administration.

<p>Bush's attacks on women's reproductive freedom, beginning even before

he took the oath of office, have convinced me that, even though he has

tossed aside the campaign promise of "compassionate conservatism," there's

one promise he means to keep. The man who in 1998 declared he would do

everything in his power to restrict abortion now has a great deal more

power to work with and he clearly intends to use it.

<p>The nomination

of John Ashcroft was a slap in the face of supporters of reproductive

freedom. Ashcroft not only opposes abortion even in cases of rape, incest

and danger to a woman's health, but also rejects some of the most popular

and effective forms of birth control.

<p>On his first day at work in the Oval Office, Bush issued an executive

order eliminating international family planning funds to organizations

that offer abortion counseling or lobby their own governments in favor

of abortion rights, putting the lives and health of women around the world

at risk.

<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson has indicated he

will revisit the Food

and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone. And anti-abortion

rights forces in the House of Representatives have already introduced a

bill to limit its availability--a bill Bush is sure to sign.

<p>And reporters overheard our new president boasting at a Catholic Charities

luncheon that his so-called faith-based initiatives would advance the anti-abortion

rights cause.

<p>This is just the beginning. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,

who has often been the critical fifth vote in support of legal abortion,

reportedly will retire at the end of this term.

Others may retire soon as well.

<p>The Bush administration is committed to actions and strategies that

limit reproductive freedoms, such as eliminating life-saving stem cell

research, criminalizing abortion providers, reducing availability of birth

control and denying funding for sex education that actually educates students

about sex.

<p>We do not declare a state of emergency and call this campaign lightly.

We fully appreciate the gravity of placing ourselves on such a high state

of alert and calling on activists to disrupt their lives and set aside

business-as-usual. But we simply refuse to be the generations that both

win and lose the rights to birth control and abortion. We are determined

not to risk a generation of women's lives and opportunities without reproductive

rights.

<p>All of us will need to take extraordinary measures in these dangerous

times. This is our opportunity literally to change the course of history

and politics in this country. I know that, fighting together, we are up

to the task.
