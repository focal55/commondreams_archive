- May 17 - The League of Conservation Voters 

                    (LCV) today rejected the Bush administration’s plan to address 

                    America’s energy problems because it focuses on dirty, unreliable 

                    and inefficient fossil fuels and other energy sources that 

                    threaten the health of our environment and the strength of 

                    our economy.  LCV believes Bush’s proposal will ensure high 

                    public health costs and energy demand well into the future, 

                    protecting the corporate bottom line of his big oil and coal 

                    allies at the expense of the public’s interest in clean air, 

                    safe water, open spaces, and low electricity and gas prices.

<p>&quot;Bush’s dirty, unbalanced, irresponsible energy policy 

                    has placed the special oil and coal interests that funded 

                    his campaign over the public’s interest in a clean, reliable, 

                    safe, and affordable energy supply,&quot; said Deb Callahan, 

                    LCV President.  &quot;American voters want a balanced, responsible, 

                    comprehensive plan for solving our energy problems that looks 

                    toward our future and makes environmental and economic sense.  

                    What they got from President Bush was a plan that increases 

                    America’s reliance on the inefficient, destructive fossil 

                    fuels of the past that pollute our air and water.  The Bush 

                    plan ignores modern, sustainable energy efficiency technologies 

                    and renewable energy alternatives that keep down costs for 

                    consumers and businesses, protecting our environment and our 

                    economy at the same time.&quot;</p>

                  <p>The White House energy plan calls for the construction of 

                    hundreds of new power plants over the next 20 years, increasing 

                    coal production and use, a long-term shift to nuclear energy, 

                    and more domestic oil and gas drilling in America’s most precious 

                    wilderness areas, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 

                    and the Rocky Mountains.  The plan fails to give meaningful 

                    attention to clean, innovative, available energy efficiency 

                    technologies and conservation measures that would address 

                    the nation’s short-term energy issues, at the same time reducing 

                    long-term demand on the nation’s finite supply of fossil fuels.  

                    A recent Department of Energy study estimates that increased 

                    energy efficiency could reduce the growing demand for electricity 

                    by 10 percent to 33 percent; the equivalent of as many as 

                    610 big 300-megawatt power plants.  Along with measures to 

                    increase use of renewable energy, these policies could save 

                    Americans $500 billion over the next two decades.</p>

                  <p>&quot;The Bush energy plan not only looks back to industrial 

                    age fuels, it is a product of industrial age politics, when 

                    corporations made backroom deals behind closed doors,&quot; 

                    Callahan added.  &quot;In this case, President Bush traded 

                    the public’s interest in a clean, safe environment for the 

                    special interests of his oil and coal campaign contributors 

                    who want to the public dependent on their dirty sources of 

                    power, making them the only people who will be better off 

                    under this energy plan.&quot;
