- April 11 -  Following is a statement

of Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president, National Women's Law Center:

<p>Today, all around the country, women are taking action against

President Bush's tax plan because they know it leaves them out

and puts their children last. They're urging their Senators

and Representatives to oppose it with rallies, petitions, personal

meetings -- whatever it takes to convince them that this tax

plan is irresponsible. On behalf of the Coalition on Women and

Taxes, I am honored to stand with the thousands of women who

are speaking out today.

<p>No one knows better than America's women what it takes to manage

a family budget. And the nation's budget is no different.

Any tax cut must be modest enough in size to leave room for

critical national priorities. But women are mobilizing because

the Bush budget, to make room for a tax cut for the wealthiest

1 percent of taxpayers, would cut child care and early learning

programs, Medicaid, health care access for the uninsured and

doctor training, and would ignore pressing needs for child support

improvements. It uses funds from the Medicare Trust Fund that

are needed to pay hospital costs for other purposes and leaves

no money to shore up Social Security. And this is only the beginning.

If the surpluses projected over the next ten years do not materialize,

more cuts are sure to follow and women will be especially

hurt. They depend on these programs more than men because they

tend to earn less during their lifetimes, live longer, and are more

likely to have uncompensated family care-taking responsibilities.

<p>Women around the country are mobilizing because they are

learning more about President Bush's tax plan, and are feeling

the sting of being left out of its benefits. The President has

talked about the need to help the single mom who is struggling

to support her family. But the truth is that a single mother with

two children would not begin to benefit from the Bush tax plan

until she is earning $22,000 a year. For a mother leaving welfare

for work at the median hourly wage of $6.60 an hour, that means

holding two jobs, working 64 hours a week, every week of the

year, before she gets a tax cut. In stark contrast, the richest

1 percent of Americans -- whose average income is over

$1.1 million per year -- will receive between 36 percent and 45

percent of the tax cut's benefits, even though they pay only

20 percent of all federal taxes.

<p>Some of the leading women's groups organizing actions in the

field today include the American Association of University

Women, the Coalition of Labor Union Women, the Feminist

Majority, the League of Women Voters, the Older Women's League

and the YWCA. Today is one day of action, but we're not going

away. In fact, our numbers are growing. We will continue to

fight this irresponsible tax plan and irresponsible budget. Our

families deserve nothing less.
