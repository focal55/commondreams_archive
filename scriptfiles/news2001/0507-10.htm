- May 7 -  Frank Raines, chairman and CEO of Fannie Mae, Maya Lin, renowned

artist and architect, and William L. Taylor, prominent civil rights

attorney, will receive the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award at

the annual dinner of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR)

on Wednesday, May 9 at the Hilton Washington and Towers, 1919

Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. A Reception will be held at

5:30 p.m., followed by dinner at 7 p.m. Our Master of Ceremonies for

the evening will be ABC-7's News Anchor Maureen Bunyan.

<p>The prestigious Humphrey Award for "selfless and devoted service

in the cause of equality" celebrates the legacy of the former United

States Vice President, Senator and civil rights pioneer.

<p>The LCCR Humphrey Award Dinner is the largest civil rights dinner

in Washington, D.C. Each year a cross-section of our nation's leaders

including members of both houses of Congress, officials from the

Executive Branch, business people, educators, and advocates for civil

and human rights attend the event.

<p>Now in its 51st year, the LCCR is the nation's oldest, most

broadly-based civil rights coalition with more than 180 major

national organizations representing persons of color, women,

children, organized labor, persons with disabilities, older

Americans, gays and lesbians, and major religious groups.

<p>The Press is invited to attend. Make arrangements in advance by

contacting Natalie Shear, dinner coordinator, at 202-833-4456. For
