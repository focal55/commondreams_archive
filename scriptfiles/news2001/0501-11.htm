- May 1 - President Bush today announced plans to move ahead with

deployment of national missile defenses, regardless of the impact on the

Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, while seeking to mollify allies by pledging

consultations and to unilaterally reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush is trying to sugar coat a poison pill,&quot; said John Isaacs,

president of the arms control advocacy group Council for a Livable World.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Walsh, a Council board member and Research Fellow at the Belfer

Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University  &quot;The

benefits of reducing nuclear weapons will be lost if missile defense

deployment sparks a new

arms race.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the President announced a series of consultations abroad, most of the

United States' close allies in Europe and Asia oppose U.S. deployment of a

missile shield, despite Bush's promise to extend it to protect them as

well.  Both Russia and China have threatened to halt cooperation with arms

control efforts, to increase their nuclear arsenals, and to proliferate

missile technology to other states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Simply put: Missile defense will make us less, not more secure,&quot; said John

Kenneth Galbraith of Harvard University, a board member and adviser to the

Council. &quot;The technology is not ready, the threat does not exist, and the

cost is immense.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Former President Clinton's land based interceptor system, estimated to cost

over $60 billion by the Congressional Budget Office, has only been tested

three times, resulting in two failures and one questionable success.

President Bush has proposed a more comprehensive system including sea and

space based interceptors that could carry a price tag in the hundreds of

billions of dollars. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush earlier this year cut $100 million from non-proliferation

programs in Russia and refused to continue the Clinton Administration

policy of negotiating with North Korea to end its missile program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no reason to make decisions about deployment or the status of the

ABM treaty now,&quot; argued Isaacs.  He added, &quot;if the Administration is

serious about protecting Americans from missile threats they should

negotiate with North Korea to end its missile program, fully fund

non-proliferation programs in Russia to help prevent the spread of nuclear

materials to unfriendly nations, and engage in bi-lateral reductions with

Russia to prevent accidental launches.&quot;
