- July 3 - Some text of a controversial trade agreement government

officials promised to release in mid-April was made public today, but the version that was

released lacks vital information and represents only a fraction of the entire pact, Public

Citizen said today. 

<p>Government officials agreed to a one-time release of a negotiating text of the proposed

Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), hoping to eliminate criticism about the secrecy of

the FTAA process. However, today&#146;s &quot;release&quot; of a partial text for

negotiations, which have been under way behind closed doors for seven years, is likely to

fan growing opposition to the proposed pact.</p>



<p>&quot;This was supposed to be a PR move aimed at calming FTAA opposition, but the

governments obviously have put out a fragment of the total agreement, one that has been

sanitized by eliminating vital information,&quot; said Lori Wallach, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Global Trade Watch. &quot;They say that this release is a one-time event

and future texts will not necessarily be made be available.</p>



<p>&quot;This one-time public relations stunt will not deceive the broad-based civil

society opposition to negotiating a trade agreement, which is being drawn up at the behest

of special interests who flatly refuse to address the concerns of environmentalists, labor

organizations or consumers when they negotiate secret agreements.&quot;</p>



<p>The FTAA text made available is only 434 pages, even though it is a &quot;bracketed

text,&quot; which means that it contains several versions or options for many clauses. Yet

public documents reveal that FTAA is slated to cover the same vast array of issues as

NAFTA, with nine FTAA negotiating groups working for years. Given that the NAFTA text is

more than 700 pages long, the FTAA text released today is only a fraction of the whole

agreement.</p>



<p>&quot;Even with a sizeable chunk of the negotiating text remaining concealed from the

public, it is clear that FTAA is all about cramming NAFTA-on-steroids down the throats of

people from Toronto to Tierra del Fuego,&quot; Wallach said. &quot;FTAA was supposed to represent the improved renegotiation of NAFTA. Instead it

worsens and expands NAFTA&#146;s worst provisions.&quot;</p>
