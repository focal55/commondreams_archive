- November 1 - When the House takes up legislation later today aimed at

tightening security at the nation's airports, it won't simply be

a showdown between Democrats and Republicans.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, the question of how to make airports safer in the

aftermath of Sept. 11 has drawn interesting battle lines among

Washington's special interests, making friends of usual enemies

and, in some cases, pitting some closely-aligned groups against

each other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That rift is no more obvious than in the split between labor

groups representing airline pilots. On one side is the Air Line

Pilots Association, representing workers at most of the nation's

biggest airlines, while on the other is the Allied Pilots

Association, which lobbies for American Airlines pilots.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Capitol Hill this week, both groups have been among the most

enthusiastic supporters of plans to tighten airport security.

The difference: Allied supports the House GOP's bill, which

would leave the job of screening baggage up to private

contractors. ALPA, meanwhile, is pushing for the

Democratic-backed legislation, which would require baggage

screeners to be federal employees. Earlier this month, the

Senate approved the Democrats' approach in a unanimous vote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps the split isn't surprising. While most unions

overwhelmingly favor Democrats with their campaign

contributions, transportation unions--including those

representing airline workers--tend to give significant sums to

Republicans. And the GOP has found no bigger booster in the

sector than Allied, which tends to support Republicans more

strongly than other air transport unions do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 1999-2000 election cycle, Allied contributed just

over $161,000 in soft money, PAC and individual contributions to

federal parties and candidates. Two-thirds of that money went to

Democrats. On the other hand, Democrats took almost 87 percent

of ALPA's reported $967,120 in contributions during the last

elections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That pattern of support hasn't changed much the opening months

of the 2002 election cycle. In the first six months of this

year, Allied contributed $58,500 to members of Congress, 59

percent to Democrats. Contribution numbers are more current for

ALPA, which reports its contributions monthly to the Federal

Election Commission. Through Sept. 30, the group had contributed

more than $400,000 to members of Congress, 83 percent to

Democrats. That includes more than $40,000 in contributions made

after Sept. 11, including a $5,000 check to Rep. Jim Oberstar

(D-Minn.). Oberstar is the top Democrat on the House

Transportation Committee and the key sponsor of the Democrats'

aviation security bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it's not only pilots that are divided over the legislation.

With the House vote expected to be tight, the list of strange

bedfellows is endless, especially among other unions. Service

Employees International Union, which represents private contract

security workers, usually is among the Democrats' biggest

supporters, but SEIU ($1.2 million in 2001; 94 percent to Dems)

supports the Republican-backed security bill. On the flip side,

unions representing federal workers, including the American

Federation of Government Employees ($123,750 in 2001; 91 percent

to Dems), are major supporters of the Democratic proposal,

partially because they stand to gain members if approved.</font></p>
