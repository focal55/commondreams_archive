- March 1 -  Women's rights leaders are

stepping up their efforts today to protect reproductive choice. The

fate of abortion rights for American women for the next 25 years

hinges on the next U.S. Supreme Court Justice nominated by President

Bush. With one to two Justices expected to step down as early as

this coming summer, the women's rights and reproductive rights

movements are galvanizing their grassroots forces in an Emergency

Action for Women's Lives on April 22.

<p>"We will not go back to days of back-alley abortions where women

will die," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority

Foundation (FMF). "We've fought too long and hard for safe, legal

and accessible abortion. The women's community is not going to sit

quietly and watch President Bush chisel away at our fundamental

reproductive rights," continued Smeal. "This emergency action is

just the beginning. We are here for the long haul and we intend to

win. We will not be the generation who both won and lost Roe v.

Wade."

<p>The Feminist Majority Foundation Campus Leadership Program,

outreaching to feminist activists at over 700 public, private and

community college campuses nationwide is launching a student campaign

for the April 22 emergency action and for the battles ahead to save

Roe. "Young women will be harmed the most if an anti-choice Justice

sits on the high court," continued Smeal. "Students are outraged and

will take to Capitol Hill so their voices will be heard."

<p>The FMF Campus Leadership Team works with thousands of college

students on campuses stretching nationwide. FMF Campus Organizers

are gearing up for dozens of campus presentations, workshops and

leadership trainings in preparation for the Emergency Action for

Women's Lives in Washington, D.C. on April 22, 2001.
