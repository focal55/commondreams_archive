- July 10 - The Human Rights Campaign urged the Bush administration at a news conference today to clarify a news report that it had cut a deal with the Salvation Army to promote employment discrimination against gays in return for the charity's public support for President Bush&#146;s troubled &#147;faith-based&#148; social services initiative.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We at the Human Rights Campaign believe in, and support, the principle of religious freedom,&#148; said HRC Political Director Winnie Stachelberg at the news conference, held in the wake of a report by The Washington Post about a leaked Salvation Army memo. &#147;What we cannot support, however, is federal funds being used by organizations to discriminate based on sexual orientation.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The memo said that in exchange for the group&#146;s support, the administration had made a &#147;firm commitment&#148; to shelter religious charities that receive federal funds from city and statewide ordinances that protect gays and lesbians from discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This kind of backroom deal &#151; this quid pro quo arrangement &#151; that would allow religious organizations to circumvent civil rights laws enacted by elected officials in state and local municipalities is reprehensible,&#148; said Stachelberg.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tried to downplay the memo today, saying that the Salvation Army had misinterpreted the administration&#146;s intentions. Asked if there was a trade-off, Fleischer told the The Associated Press, &#147;Oh no, absolutely not.&#148; He added that there never has been a deal, and the author of the report misread the administration&#146;s position. &#147;They&#146;ve been advised of that,&#148; he told the AP.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on the memo&#146;s vivid details illustrating the administration&#146;s alleged commitment to the Salvation Army, however, HRC is calling on the administration to further clarify its position and fully disclose its objectives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Salvation Army proposed amending a current regulation that said that federal agencies cannot award assistance to local or state authorities that require religious charities to &#147;adopt terms or practices for those with religious responsibilities&#148; or to provide employment benefits if they are &#147;inconsistent with the beliefs and practices&#148; of the charity, according to the leaked memo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal, state and local civil rights laws already exempt religious organizations, allowing them to freely discriminate in choosing their clergy and to favor their own religion in non-clergy positions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What has never been decided by the Court, however, is the question of whether religious organizations may freely discriminate using public funds &#151; federal taxpayer dollars, in this case. In addition, a debate is currently under way in the U.S. Congress as the president&#146;s &#147;faith-based&#148; initiatives proposal moves through the House and the Senate. It appears that the Salvation Army is attempting an end run around Congress, with the assistance of the administration, says HRC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the prospect of hiring lesbian and gay Americans, Salvation Army spokesman George Hood said in the memo that &#147;it really begins to chew away at the theological fabric of who we are.&#148; But the organization knew that its sudden endorsement of discrimination would upset those who see the group as non-ideological, according to the memo. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Salvation Army&#146;s role will be a surprise to many in the media,&#148; said the report which urged that the group should &#147;minimize the possibility of any &#145;leak&#146; to the media.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To prevent public relations problems, such as today&#146;s development, the Salvation Army &#151; better known for helping the homeless &#151; projects spending $88,000 to $110,000 a month for lobbying and public relations assistance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.</font></p>
