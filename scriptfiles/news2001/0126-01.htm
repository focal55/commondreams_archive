- January 26 - Tesco and Asda/Wal-Mart, two of the top 

food retailers in Great Britain, today announced that all their 

own-brand meat and dairy products will be produced from 

animals fed with non-genetically engineered (GE) feed. This 

announcement underscores the total rejection of GE crops 

throughout Europe’s food industry. Over 80 percent of U.S. 

soybean and corn exports to Europe go into animal feed. 

<p>

"American farmers should know the market realities before 

they grow genetically engineered crops this season," said 

Charles Margulis, a Greenpeace Genetic Engineering 

Specialist. "With the bottom dropping out of the European 

market for GE feed, there soon will be no place to sell 

America’s unwanted crops."

</p>

<p>

Cargill, the largest U.S. grain supplier to Europe, is finding 

itself in a losing battle as U.S. grain exports have already 

dropped by $1 billion due to rejection of genetically 

engineered crops abroad.  Other grain dealers like Archer 

Daniels Midland and Bunge, which have urged farmers to 

separate GE crops if they grow them, could be better 

positioned to serve European needs. Last year Bunge told 

farmers: “Bunge Corporation recognizes that consumer 

resistance in the near-term to the use of GMO's in certain 

markets both in the U.S. and abroad may necessitate 

segregation for specific commodities."

</p>

<p>

"Since April 1999, virtually the entire European food industry 

has eliminated GE ingredients,” added Margulis, "but 

Brazil’s been cashing in while U.S. farmers struggle. Seeing 

this trend repeating with animal feed is terrible news for U.S. 

farmers."

</p>

<p>

Both Tesco and Asda expect to sell non-GE pork, poultry, 

eggs and fish by this fall, with other products to follow. All 

three of Britain’s top supermarkets have now announced 

their intention to eliminate GE crops from animal feed, 

including Sainsbury markets, which made its commitment 

last year. Other European food companies, such as the 

Belgian supermarket Carrefour and Wiesenhof, Germany’s 

biggest chicken producer, have announced their intention to 

sell only animals fed with non-GE feed. McDonald’s recently 

announced that its chicken products sold across Europe 

will be from animals fed with non-GE feed.

</p>

<p>

"Europe will label genetically engineered animal feed, but 

Americans still don’t have labels on GE food," said Charles 

Margulis, a Greenpeace Genetic Engineering Specialist. 

"While Europeans protect their animals from these genetic 

experiments, the genetic engineers are force feeding these 

foods to American children."
