- January 9 - The following was released

today by the Feminist Majority:

<p>John Ashcroft is a totally anti-choice, anti-women's rights

nomination for Attorney General. Not only did Ashcroft staunchly

oppose the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), as Missouri's Attorney

General he filed suit against the National Organization for Women

(NOW) in 1979. Ashcroft charged NOW with anti-trust violations and

attempted to break the ERA convention boycott of unratified states.

"John Ashcroft has been an ardent opponent of women's rights for

over 20 years," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist

Majority and former NOW president during the Ashcroft anti-ERA

lawsuit. "His willingness to stretch the law and use Missouri tax

dollars to launch a three-year unsuccessful fight against NOW and

the ERA all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court foreshadows how far

he will go to fight and deny women's rights," added Smeal. "His

utter lack of understanding of freedom of political speech and the

right to take political action to achieve social justice

exemplifies a track record where his right-wing ideology prevails

over his legal judgment."

<p>"President-elect Bush promised to be a uniter and not a divider,

yet Ashcroft's opposition to legal abortion even in cases of rape

and incest places him on the extreme edge of the far right that

opposes all women's rights advances," said Smeal. As a U.S.

Senator, Ashcroft did not support an amendment to the Bankruptcy

Reform Act of 1999 that would have prohibited anti-abortion

extremists from using bankruptcy to discharge civil judgments

against them for illegal anti-abortion activities. "Ashcroft's

position undermines a critical enforcement mechanism of the Freedom

of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE), which the Attorney

General is chiefly responsible for enforcing," continued Smeal.

<p>In addition to his widely reported commencement address to, and

honorary degree from, Bob Jones University, Ashcroft's civil rights

record falls far short of what must be demanded of a 21st Century

Attorney General. In 1989 former President George Bush appointed

Ashcroft to a federal commission to study the obstacles faced by

minorities in America. Ashcroft was one of only two people on the

40-member panel who refused to sign the final report. He thought

the report's findings of discrimination were far too negative and

"counterproductive."

<p>"The Attorney General must be able to recognize injustices in

our society and work to remedy them -- he must neither rationalize,

justify, nor run away from them," said Smeal. "How can an Attorney

General that believes Southern Partisan is setting the record

straight be able to lead in the enforcement of civil rights and

women's rights laws?" questioned Smeal.
