- March 20 - Nearly 500 leading U.S.

and Canadian scientists called on President Bush today to stop

trying to change the law that prohibits oil extraction in the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The letter urged President Bush to

"support permanent protection of the coastal plain's significant

wildlife and wilderness values."

<p>The scientists said oil development could seriously harm

caribou, polar bears, muskoxen and snow geese -- among other

wildlife. They warned it could disrupt the fragile ecosystem of the

coastal plain, which they said could lead to even more widespread

injury to wildlife and its habitat.

<p>"Nearly the entire Arctic Coast of Alaska north of the Brooks

Range is available for oil and gas and gas exploration or

development. The 110-mile-long coastal plain of the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 1.5 million acres of key

wildlife habitat vital to the integrity of the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge. We urge you, Mr. President, to permanently protect

the biological diversity and wilderness character of the coastal

plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from future oil and

gas development," the letter concludes.

<p>The signers are experts in the fields of ecology, wildlife and

conservation biology, resource management and cultural

anthropology. They include George Schaller, world-renowned as the

greatest naturalist of the 20th century; Edward O. Wilson, winner

of the National Medal of Science and two Pulitzer Prizes for his

landmark books on social biology; and David Klein, professor

emeritus at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, noted Arctic

scientist and winner of the prestigious Aldo Leopold Award for

lifetime distinguished service to the profession. More than 50 of

the signers are Alaskan scientists.

<p>The letter was organized by Defenders of Wildlife, the Alaska

state office of the National Audubon Society, and the Wildlife

Conservation Society.

<p>"This letter poses a stark choice for this administration. Will

they stop ignoring an overwhelming scientific consensus and large

majorities of the American people that support protection for the

Arctic Wildlife Refuge, or keep listening only to oil corporations

that want to exploit the last protected five percent of Alaska's

north coast?" said Robert Dewey, vice president for government

affairs of Defenders of Wildlife.

<p>The Honorable George W. Bush

President of the United States

The White House

Washington, DC 20500

<p>Dear Mr. President:

<p>As scientists and natural resource managers from the United

States and Canada with many years of experience in ecology,

wildlife and conservation biology, resource management and cultural

anthropology, we encourage you to reconsider plans for exploring

and developing the potential oil and gas reserves of the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain. Instead, we urge you to

support permanent protection of the coastal plain's significant

wildlife and wilderness values.

<p>The wildlands of the Arctic Refuge include the barrier islands

and estuaries of the Beaufort Sea, the Arctic coastal plain, the

Brooks Range, and the boreal forest within the upper Yukon River

watershed. First set aside by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as

the Arctic National Wildlife Range in 1960, this is the United

State's only conservation unit that encompasses an intact arctic

ecosystem. Combined with the adjacent Ivvavik and Vuntut national

parks in Canada, the Arctic Refuge represents one of the largest

protected landscapes in the world. Moreover, the Arctic Refuge's

coastal plain is a rare example of an ecosystem where ecological

and cultural processes continue to interact much as they have for

thousands of years. Unlike the adjoining refuge lands, that are

designated Wilderness, the coastal plain is not permanently

protected from development.

<p>When President Eisenhower established the Arctic National

Wildlife Range, he had the foresight and wisdom to include the

entire ecosystem both south and north of the Brooks Range,

encompassing the biologically rich coastal plain considered

essential to the integrity of this ecosystem. In 1980, Congress

enlarged the range to encompass additional wildlife habitat and

designated this unique area the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The refuge mission was broadened to include international research

and management, as well as support for subsistence uses that form

the basis of Native cultural values. Most of the original wildlife

range was designated as a Wilderness. Only the 1.5 million-acre

coastal plain was omitted. And today, this oversight remains a

significant concern.

<p>Five decades of biological study and scientific research have

confirmed that the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife

Refuge forms a vital component of the biological diversity of the

refuge and merits the same kind of permanent safeguards and

precautionary management as the rest of this original conservation

unit. In contrast to the broad (greater than 150 mi.) coastal

plain to the west of the Arctic Refuge, the coastal plain within

the refuge is much narrower (15-40 mi.). This unique compression

of habitats concentrates the occurrence of a wide variety of

wildlife and fish species, including polar bears, grizzly bears,

wolves, wolverines, caribou, muskoxen, Dolly Varden, Arctic

grayling, snow geese, and more than 130 other species of migratory

birds. In fact, according to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service,

the

Arctic Refuge coastal plain contains the greatest wildlife

diversity of any protected area above the Arctic Circle.

<p>The coastal plain provides essential calving and post-calving

habitat for the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the largest (at about

130,000 animals) international migratory caribou herd in the world.

The United States and Canada share the immense responsibility of

managing this herd and protecting the key habitats on which the

herd depends. In 1987, the two nations signed an international

agreement to protect the Porcupine Caribou Herd. Since then, the

calving grounds on the Canadian side of the border have received

full protection, while the United States has not yet taken similar

steps to adequately protect this essential habitat within the

coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, where most calving occurs. The

Gwich'in Nation of Alaska and Canada depends upon the sustained

productivity of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, for their subsistence

economy and cultural identity, and are justifiably concerned about

its security. Extensive research on the Central Arctic Caribou Herd

at Prudhoe Bay indicates appreciable losses of preferred calving

and summer habitats in response to petroleum development. Although

the Central Arctic Herd has recently increased associated with mild

weather conditions, we cannot be certain that even current

state-of-the-art mitigation measures will guarantee access to

critical habitats for the much larger, more densely aggregated

Porcupine Herd. Displacement to new calving areas from developed

oil fields, as has occurred with a portion of the Central Arctic

Herd, does not appear to be an option for the Porcupine Herd

because of the lack of suitable adjacent terrain.

<p>Biologists also have identified conservation concerns with other

wildlife populations in the Arctic Refuge, including polar bears,

muskoxen, and snow geese. Although many polar bears den on the pack

ice, the refuge's coastal plain is the most important land denning

area for Beaufort Sea bears in Alaska. Muskoxen are year-round

residents of the coastal plain, and disturbance from industrial

development, particularly in winter, holds the potential to

increase energetic costs and result in decreased calf production.

Also, snow geese might be displaced from important feeding and

staging habitats prior to autumn migration, increasing energy

expenditure and reducing their ability to accumulate the fat needed

for migration. The coastal plain serves many biological functions,

including nesting habitat for shorebirds, waterfowl, songbirds,

raptors, and other migratory birds.

<p>The Interior Department has predicted that oil and gas

exploration and development would have a major effect on water

resources. Fresh water already is limited on the refuge's coastal

plain, and direct damage to wetlands will adversely affect fish,

waterfowl, and other migratory birds. These potentially disruptive

effects to fish and wildlife should not be viewed in isolation,

however. Arctic ecosystems are characterized by many complex

interactions, and changes to one component may have secondary but

significant effects on other parts of this fragile ecosystem.

Based on our collective experience and understanding of the

cumulative effects of oil and gas exploration and development on

Alaska's North Slope, we do not believe these impacts have been

adequately considered for the Arctic Refuge, and mitigation without

adequate data on this complex ecosystem is unlikely. Oil

exploration and development have substantially changed environments

where they have occurred in Alaska's central Arctic. Since the

discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay in 1968, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife

Service estimated about 800 square miles of Arctic habitats have

been transformed into one of the world's largest industrial

complexes. Oil spills, contaminated waste, and other sources of

pollution have had measurable environmental impacts, in spite of

strict environmental regulations. Roads, pipelines, well pads,

processing facilities, and other support infrastructure have

incrementally altered the character of this ecosystem.

<p>Please understand that we are not philosophically opposed to oil

and gas development in Alaska. Indeed, we all clearly recognize

the need for balanced resource management. But we also recognize

the importance of maintaining the biological diversity and

ecosystem integrity of our nation's Arctic. Nearly the entire

Arctic Coast of Alaska north of the Brooks Range is available for

oil and gas exploration or development. The 110-mile-long coastal

plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 1.5

million acres of key wildlife habitat vital to the integrity of the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We urge you, Mr. President, to

permanently protect the biological diversity and wilderness

character of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife

Refuge from future oil and gas development.

<p>Thank you for considering our concerns and recommendations.
