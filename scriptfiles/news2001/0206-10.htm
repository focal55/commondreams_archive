- February 6 - The following is a

statement by Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National

Abortion Federation:

<p>I am here today on behalf of the health care professionals

who provide safe, high quality abortion care to women. I am also

here on behalf of the women who choose abortion each year,

including those who have flooded our hotline with calls in recent

months, seeking information about mifepristone.

<p>I join my colleagues today in opposing this latest attempt by

anti-choice legislators to use politics to deny American women

access to a very safe method of early abortion.

<p>As many of you know, the Reagan and Bush administrations

prevented mifepristone from being available in the United States

because of their staunch opposition to a woman's right to choose.

Eight years ago, in 1993, President Clinton lifted the ban on

mifepristone and US clinical trials were finally conducted. For

those who have attempted to argue that mifepristone was

"fast-tracked" though the approval process, I'd like to emphasize

that its approval took almost 8 years.

<p>There is no doubt that mifepristone is a very safe method for

early abortion. In Europe, more than 620,000 women have now used

mifepristone safely to end a very early pregnancy. Close to 9,000

American women used the medication safely and effectively in

clinical trials. In fact, in the US clinical trials less than one

half of 1 percent of women required any serious medical

intervention. Since its availability in November, hundreds more

women have used mifepristone without any major complications. All

of the medical and scientific data clearly illustrate the

outstanding safety record of this medication. And yet, members of

Congress, most of whom have worked for years to take away a woman's

right to choose, are questioning mifepristone's safety.

<p>We should instead be questioning the motivation behind this

legislation. Restrictions similar to those contained in this bill

were considered by the FDA and rejected as medically unnecessary,

and inconsistent with the way medicine is practiced in this

country.

<p>For example, the FDA requires that a doctor offering

mifepristone be able to accurately date the pregnancy, be able to

diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, and be able to complete a surgical

abortion or arrange for back-up from another provider in the small

number of cases where a surgical abortion is necessary to complete

the procedure. The FDA specifically did not require that the

physician providing mifepristone be a surgical abortion provider,

because it is standard medical practice for a doctor to refer to

another physician if they do not provide a particular service.

<p>Claims that this legislation is motivated by a concern for

women's health are at best, disingenuous, and at worst, dishonest.

<p>In the last year, NAF has conducted accredited medical education

programs for more than 2,000 physicians, nurses, counselors and

other health care professionals in the safe administration of

mifepristone. Many of the clinicians who participated in our

training program are now offering mifepristone to women around the

country.

<p>We are proud of our role in ensuring the accessibility of this

medical breakthrough because mifepristone allows women to access

abortion care earlier than it has traditionally been available.

And earlier abortion is safer for women.

<p>We believe that the promise of mifepristone is that it will

eventually increase access to abortion services for women, as more

physicians add this option to their practices. It is this potential

of mifepristone to expand the pool of abortion providers that

threatens those who want to restrict its use. Let there be no

mistake -- this has nothing to do with women's health, and

everything to do with anti-choice politics.

<p>In September of last year, when mifepristone was approved by the

FDA for very early abortion, science finally triumphed over

politics. American women finally gained access to a method that

has been used by millions of women worldwide for more than a

decade. Members of Congress with questions about mifepristone need

look no further than to the FDA, to the vast body of medical

research documenting mifepristone's safety, and to the experiences

of the millions of women worldwide who have used this method safely

and effectively. There is no medical reason to impose further

restrictions. Members of Congress should leave the approval of new

medications to the FDA, and the practice of medicine to physicians.

<p><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional association

of abortion providers in the US and Canada dedicated to ensuring

that abortion remains safe, legal and accessible. Additional
