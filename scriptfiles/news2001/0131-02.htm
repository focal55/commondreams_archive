- January 31 - News Advisory:

<p>On Feb. 5-6, Hollywood stars Martin Sheen, Michael Douglas

and Paul Newman will ask President George W. Bush to work with the

Russians to take all nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert. The

celebrities will join thousands of people expected to light-up the

White House switch board with calls as part of the National Call-in

Days coordinated by the Back from the Brink Campaign, a nationwide

effort to de-alert all nuclear weapons. Forty-three national

organizations support the Campaign, begun in December 1999 as an

effort to reduce the threat of accidental nuclear war.

<p>"I'll be delighted to call the White House on February 5," says

Sheen, who plays U.S. President Josiah Bartlet on NBC's West Wing.

"Having thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert is an

accident waiting to happen. President Bush expressed concern about

this issue during his campaign. I'm going to call him to remind him

that he was right." Numerous religious leaders and former members

of the defense establishment also support the effort to take

nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert. These include Robert

McNamara, who was Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy

administration and who is available for comment. McNamara is

portrayed as a pivotal figure in the major motion picture 13 Days,

a three-hour thriller depicting the Cuban Missile Crisis.

<p>"While the Kennedys had 13 days to avoid nuclear war, today's

leaders have less than 13 minutes," says Ira Shorr, director of

Back from the Brink. Despite no longer being Cold War enemies, the

U.S. and Russia still have thousands of nuclear weapons on

hair-trigger alert, poised to be launched at a moment's notice. In

a time of crisis or perceived attack, leaders on both sides have

just minutes to decide whether to launch a massive nuclear strike.

A single miscalculation or computer error could lead to nuclear

war. Since a 1995 near-miss accidental nuclear launch, the serious

deterioration of Russia's radar and early warning systems has

increased the danger. "The Russians came within minutes of

launching their missiles in 1995," Shorr says. "They feel even more

vulnerable today and have tightened their hold on the nuclear

hair-trigger."

<p>What would an accidental nuclear war look like? The U.S. and

Russia, together have some 5,000 nuclear weapons on hair-trigger

alert -- the equivalent of 100,000 Hiroshima bombs.

<p>President Bush has publicly called for de-alerting as many

nuclear weapons as possible. In May 2000, he told a room full of

leading statesmen and defense experts that "keeping so many weapons

on high alert may create unacceptable risks of accidental or

unauthorized launch." As was noted in the Republican Part's 2000

platform, keeping thousands of nuclear weapons on a hair-trigger is

"another unnecessary vestige of Cold War confrontation."

<p>"During the National Call-in Days I am going to join my friends

in calling President Bush to urge him to reduce the danger of

accidental nuclear war by taking all nuclear weapons off of

hair-trigger alert," says Paul Newman. "Please join me to let

President Bush know you feel the same way."
