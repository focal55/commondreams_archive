- December 6 - A secret U.S.

Environmental Protection Agency analysis shows that the current

Clean Air Act -- if enforced strictly -- generally would mean

cleaner air than a national "cap and trade" emissions --trading

scheme drafted by the Bush Administration's EPA.

<p>News of the analysis comes amid reports that incoming Republican

National Committee Chairman Mark Racicot will continue lobbying for

a dirty-power company coalition, led by Southern Company, that

seeks to weaken enforcement of the Clean Air Act, specifically its

"New Source Review" provisions.

<p>The Bush administration is expected in the near future to

endorse new loopholes and other weakening changes to New Source

Review, which is designed to prevent pollution increases from older

power plants and factories that undergo expansions and major

modifications.

<p>The secret EPA analysis, presented in a meeting with power

company executives from the Edison Electric Institute, indicates

that weakening the Clean Air Act will lead to increased pollution

-- even if the administration follows up with a new "cap-and-trade"

cleanup plan that would allow power companies to buy and sell

emission credits.

<p>The analysis shows that dangerous sulfur dioxide emissions from

electric power plants would be lower in every part of the country

under "business as usual" (enforcement of the current Clean Air

Act) than under a draft EPA plan to eviscerate much of current law

and replace it with a cap-and-trade plan.

<p>Future coal burning also would be less under current law,

suggesting carbon dioxide emissions would be less as well,

according to the analysis. The analysis also shows that

smog-forming nitrogen oxides emissions would be lower under current

law in most areas with smog problems (the Northeast, the Midwest,

the Southeast and Texas.) In addition, mercury emissions from

coal-fired power plants would be reduced more quickly under current

law.

<p>The EPA analysis is available on the Clean Air Trust's Web site

at <a href="http://www.cleanairtrust.org" target="_new">www.cleanairtrust.org</a>.
