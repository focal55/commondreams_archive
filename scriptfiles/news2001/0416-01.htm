- April 16 -  Low-yield

earth-penetrating nuclear weapons, intended to threaten deep

bunkers without killing the surrounding population, would release

dangerous fallout, according to an analysis by the Federation of

American Scientists.

<p>Some nuclear weapons developers have advocated developing and

testing new small nuclear weapons as a way to destroy deeply buried

bunkers containing enemy leaders or biological weapons. Delivered

by a bomb or missile that would strike the ground a high speed and

penetrate deeply before exploding, the weapon is intended to

destroy the bunker but leave nearby civilians unharmed because the

earth over the explosion would contain it.

<p>But the study, performed by Princeton University physicist Robert

Nelson, finds this to be technologically impossible. "No

earth-burrowing missile can penetrate deep enough into the earth to

contain an explosion with a nuclear yield even as small as 1 percent

of the Hiroshima weapon. The explosion simply blows out a massive

crater of radioactive dirt, which rains down on the local region

with especially intense and deadly fallout," according to

the study.

<p>A 1-kiloton explosion, less than one tenth that of the Hiroshima

bomb, would need to be under 450 feet of earth to be fully

contained. But the U.S. B61-11 deep-penetrating bomb only

penetrates about 20 feet. A tactical missile might possibly

penetrate to 100 feet, although it would be difficult for a

nuclear warhead to function after such an impact.

<p>If an underground explosion is not contained, it becomes very

"dirty", in that the earth above it is made radioactive and thrown

over a large area. Thus, use of even a small earth-penetrating

warhead in a populated area would cause significant civilian

casualties, according to the study.

<p>Scientists who built the first atomic bomb founded the

Federation of American Scientists in 1945. More than half of the

current American Nobel Laureates today serve on the FAS Board of

Sponsors. FAS conducts research, analysis, and advocacy on public

policy issues created by advances in science and technology (see
