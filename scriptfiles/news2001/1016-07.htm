- October 16 -  Today, the U.S. House of Representatives gave the President a green light

to sell weapons to a region whose political volatility was again

demonstrated in yesterday's border skirmish between India and Pakistan.

The legislation, passed with little debate, waives U.S. law that prohibits

direct assistance to a country whose elected head of government was deposed

by a military coup. Additionally, Congressional notification periods for

certain types of arms transfers were reduced.  The bill is unnecessary and

harmful to U.S. interests for the following reasons:



<p>U.S. CANNOT CONTROL ITS WEAPONS EXPORTS



<p>Past experience in Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan shows that the U.S. cannot

control its weapons exports, nor their recipients.  Over and over, the

United States faces enemies it previously armed.  In the 1980s, the United

States supplied arms worth $500 million a year to anti-Soviet fighters,

including the Taliban.  The weapons include high-powered sniper rifles and

Stinger missiles which now threaten U.S. troops. 



<p>U.S. LAW PROHIBITS U.S. ARMS EXPORTS TO GOVERNMENTS IN POWER DUE TO A

MILITARY COUP



<p>Congress passed legislation, Section 508 of the Foreign Operations

Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001, prohibiting the export of U.S.

weapons and military assistance to countries whose duly elected head of

government is deposed. Reversing this policy without credible evidence for

the re- establishment of democracy demonstrates that the U.S. will brush

aside democratic principles when they are inconvenient. This undermines

future U.S. efforts to promote democracy in unstable regions.



<p>PRESIDENT HAS EMERGENCY POWERS



<p>Pursuant to Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act, the President

exercised his authority to provide U.S. weapons and military assistance

when U.S. national security interests are threatened by authorizing $100

million in military aid to Pakistan after September 11th.  Additionally,

Sec. 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act authorizes the President to transfer

excess defense articles in times of national emergency.  The President is

required to notify Congress if he proceeds under these provisions.

Congress should not reduce its oversight role unless the President

certifies that assistance provided under these sections is insufficient and

Congress consents.



<p>U.S. AID SHOULD BE HUMANITARIAN, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL



<p>The United States should target its aid toward Pakistan and India immediate

needs. In the UN's Human Development Index, which measures a country's

social and economic needs, India is listed at #115, and Pakistan at #127 -

out of a listing of 162 countries. The influx of refugees will only

exacerbate those countries' economic problems.  Economic and humanitarian

assistance is much more critical -- and appropriate -- than new weapons.
