- November 7 - Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered people today woke to the 

news of winning five out of six GLBT-related ballot measures in yesterday¹s 

elections. On November 6, voters overwhelmingly supported the rights of gay, 

lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the ballot box. 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Three measures in Michigan cities ­ two to enact discriminatory city charter 

amendments and one to repeal a civil rights law ­ all were rejected by 

strong margins. Also, two favorable Miami Beach measures passed in Dade 

County, Florida to extend domestic partnership coverage to same sex 

employees. The last measure to be decided ­ a Houston, Texas city 

proposition to ban domestic partnership ­ unfortunately passed by a narrow 

margin. 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The electoral results come as nearly 2,500 activists and organizers 

gathering in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for the annual Creating Change conference, 

the premier national conference of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and 

transgender movement. 

</font>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"For years at Creating Change we have mourned repeated losses on anti-gay 

ballot measures. This year we are thrilled to celebrate victory in five of 

six. The message of the vast majority of voters was clear ­ they 

resoundingly rebuffed right wing extremists trying to impose their bigotry 

upon these communities," said NGLTF executive director Lorri L. Jean. "Our 

community is starting to turn the tide on the religious-based intolerance 

that has led to these measures."

The following summarizes the measures on the November 6 ballot:

Voters in Miami Beach overwhelmingly approved two measures give domestic partnership benefits to the unmarried partners – both same-sex and opposite-sex – of Miami Beach city employees. Voters considered two ballot measures. 

</font>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measure 102 passed by a margin of 65.7 to 34.3 percent and will extend health care benefits to the domestic partners of all Miami Beach city workers. 

</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measure 115 passed by a margin of 68.5 to 31.5 percent and will extend pension benefits to the domestic partners of fire and police workers. 

</font>

</ul>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Jorge Mursuli, chair of SaveDade, commented on the victories: "Consistent grassroots organizing has an impact. Four years ago even our supporters were skeptical about our ability to succeed. Today, we have nearly 70 percent of the voters with us. It is a testament to our ability to organize. We are 

grateful to everyone, especially NGLTF, who has been consistently with us for so long."

The vote was historic since it was the first time since 1977 that voters anywhere in Dade County have considered a GLBT issue at the ballot box. The last was Anita Bryant's Save Our Children crusade when voters repealed of Dade County’s human rights ordinance. NGLTF field organizer Dan Hawes has been in Dade County for three weeks working with the Miami Beach Workplace 

Equality campaign on voter education and get out the vote efforts. NGLTF training director Dave Fleischer worked with Save Dade in early stages of the voter identification efforts.

In three cities, voters supported the civil rights of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. Voters in Kalamazoo and Traverse City rejected discriminatory amendments their city charters that would have prohibited the city councils from enacting laws to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 

Huntington Woods voters preserved a previously-passed law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation.

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kalamazoo voters rejected a discriminatory charter amendment by a margin of 54 to 46 percent.

This is the second time Houston voters decided a GLBT-related measure, the 

first being in 1985 when the local law banning discrimination on the basis 

of sexual orientation was repealed by a margin of 82 to18 percent. Tuesday¹s 

vote represented more then a two-fold increase in support for GLBT people in 

Houston.

NGLTF has prioritized work against anti-GLBT ballot measures as an important component of its work. The Task Force has assigned staff to work on these initiatives and has committed $100,000 to give grants to state and local campaigns. Already this year, NGLTF gave  $10,000 to Kalamazoo Against Discrimination, $5,000 to Traverse City Campaign Against Discrimination, and $20,000 to Basic Rights Oregon, which expects to face an anti-GLBT ballot measure next year. Additional grants are pending as plans for 2002 measures become more solidified. The Task Force 

is the only national organization that provides electoral training in how to defeat anti-GLBT ballot initiatives.

and Lesbian Task Force, will be attending more than 140 workshops, sessions,

on electoral organizing and a live precinct walking exercise on Saturday 

morning in Milwaukee. For more information about the Creating Change
