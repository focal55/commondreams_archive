New Accord May Open Way for Democratization of Network<br>

Ratification Vote Slated for Later this Week</font></div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- November 19 - The Pacifica National Board agreed 

Sunday to voluntarily dissolve, reconstitute itself as an interim board 

with new members, and then to implement a democratization 

process for the five-station network.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dissidents and majority factions on Pacifica's embattled 15-

member board agreed to each appoint five of their members to a 

new interim board. In addition, five entirely new members would be 

appointed by the chairs of Pacifica's five Local Advisory Boards.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the formula would effectively place majority control of the 

board in the hands of the Pacifica reform movement (four out of the 

five LABs are dominated by reformers), all decisions of the interim 

board must be agreed upon by two-thirds vote or 10 out of the 15 

members.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interim board would be tasked with organizing listener 

elections at each of the five LABs. These elections would be 

modeled after KPFA's elected LAB, which just last week sent out 

30,000 ballots to qualified voters. Each elected LAB would appoint 

one member to a new permanent Pacifica national board, which 

would then operate like a majority-rules nonprofit board.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new interim board could be constituted as early as Tuesday or 

Wednesday of this week, Pacifica board member Tomas Moran 

told a packed conference room at the Doubletree Hotel in northern 

Virginia.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moran also said that board was committed to returning Democracy 

Now! to the air at all five Pacifica stations. KPFA in Berkeley has 

been airing and distributing the program since Amy Goodman and 

the Democracy Now! team were forced out of WBAI as part of a 

purge of some 26 staffers at the New York station.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new accord is subject to review by attorney's for majority and 

minority factions on the board. It also needs to be ratified by the 

five board members who could not attend this weekend's meeting 

(Marion Barry, Dick Gregory, Valrie Chambers, Rabbi Aaron 

Kriegel, and Krishna Roy).  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If approved, the new deal will not necessarily end the litigation by 

LAB members and listeners that is now before Alameda Superior 

Court. In settlement negotiations just two weeks ago, an 

agreement had been reached that would essentially transfer a 

majority of the board over to the control of reformers. But it appears 

that today's announcement supercedes that settlement.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new accord was made after a dramatic weekend board 

meeting where more than a hundred listener-activists converged on 

the Doubletree Hotel just outside of Washington, DC. Activists 

demanded - among other things -- the resignation of the board 

majority, the democratization of the network's governance, and the 

return of fired and banned programmers at New York station WBAI 

99.5 FM.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most conservative forces at this weekend's meeting were the 

station General Managers, the National Program Director, and the 

Pacifica Network News (PNN) staff. They have been the most 

militant advocates of carrying the battle forward. Board member 

John Murdock also seemed eager for confrontation.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the fact remains that the network is functionally insolvent and 

incapable of sustaining any more damage. New reports this 

weekend say network execs have spent $3 million -- or 30 percent 

of the organization's annual budget - on the battle. PR firm Westhill 

Partners is reported to have charged $230,000 alone.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica Board member Tomas Moran said the new interim board 

would immediately focus on number of &quot;hot issues.&quot; He listed the 

following:  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) Democracy Now!, saying it will to return as soon as possible to all Pacifica stations.<br>

2) The Pacifica Network News (PNN) stringers strike<br>

3) Audit of the finances of the network<br>

4) Appointing a new executive director<br>

5) Appointing a comptroller to deal with financial crisis<br>

6) Review of National Program Director Utrice Leid<br>

7) Severance package of outgoing Executive Director Bessie Wash<br>

8) Formation of a Board committee to review the situation at WBAI<br>

9) Formation of an oversight committee of the Board to evaluate and work with General Managers.<br>

10) Deal with the lawsuits against the network<br>

11) Dropping of all outstanding charges against members of the Pacifica community<br>

12) No new major expenditures</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moran also said there will be no executive committee under the 

plan. A Chair and Treasurer will exist in name only. Instead, the 

entire board has committed to working together, through 

conference calls, to resolve the outstanding issues affecting the 

network.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wbix.org will replay their coverage of events this week. Errol 

Maitland twice asked Board Chairman Bob Farrell for permission to 

webcast the proceedings, and was denied.  Nevertheless, wbix.org, 

in conjunction with the DC Independent Media Center, managed to 

transmit the events with commentary, via cell phone. In addition, 

the webstream carried live reports from major protests at the 

School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia and at the 

IMF/World Bank protests in Ottawa. Hear their coverage at
