- July 12 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What: <br>

Press briefing with missile defense experts critical of 

administration policies. For Washington-based journalists 

covering the Saturday, July 14 flight tests of missile defense 

systems which will try to shoot down a mock warhead over the 

Pacific with interceptors launched from Vandenberg. The last 

test on July 8, 2000, failed. Briefing sponsored by Business 

Leaders for Sensible Priorities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When: <br>

Friday, July 13, 10:30 a.m. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where: <br>

Cannon House Office Building, Room 121 (first floor) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who: <br>

-- Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll (US Navy, ret.), recently 

retired as Vice President of the Center for Defense Information, 

the first naval officer to serve as director of all military 

operations for all U.S. forces in Europe and the Middle East. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Craig Eisendrath, Senior Fellow, Center for International 

Policy; co-author of the influential pamphlet ;Shield of Dreams; 

and of the forthcoming book The Phantom Defense: America's 

Pursuit of the Star Wars Illusion; drafter of the 1967 Outer 

Space Treaty outlawing weaponization of space. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Rep. Janice Schakowsky (D-IL), who said today, &quot;Missile 

defense is a program that is destined for failure on so many 

levels. Rather than spending billions of dollars on a 'shield of 

dreams,' we should devote those resources to investments that 

will improve people's lives in our communities.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Rep. John Tierney (D-MA), (invited) who waged a successful 

fight with the Defense Department to make public the report of 

former Pentagon chief civilian test evaluator Philip Coyle on 

missile defense. He wrote in The Boston Globe. The report 

describes how the tests are being dumbed down to ensure public 

perception of success (and) finds that the system can't defend 

against accidental or unauthorized launches.... Despite these 

warnings, President Bush proposes accelerating deployment.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Frank von Hippel, Chairman,Federation of American 

Scientists, Princeton professor and former Assistant Director 

for National Security at the White House Office of Science and 

Technology Policy </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Alan Kliegerman, CEO of AKPharma,Inc., representative of 

Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, a group of 600 CEOs 

opposing missile defense. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sponsored by Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, 'the 

briefing will address key technical, strategic and political 

dimensions of Saturday's tests not revealed in the just 

completed July 12 briefing with Rumsfeld and other missile 

defense proponents, such as how the tests are rigged to increase 

the likelihood of appearing successful, why they tend to fail 

anyway, and the implications of the recently published Coyle 

report on the total ineffectiveness of missile defense 

technology under more realistic conditions. The report concluded 

the program was so immature that &quot;a rigorous assessment of the 

potential system performance cannot be made&quot; and was kept secret 

by the Defense Department. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers will address Pentagon's announcement that it would 

seek 2002 funding for what it calls a &quot;test&quot; facility in Alaska, 

but which could become a command center for an operational 

system of interceptors in case of &quot;emergency&quot; by 2004, i.e., 

within the term of the Bush presidency, directly violating the 

ABM Treaty. Asked by The Wall Street Journal this week what 

would constitute emergency, a Pentagon spokesperson said that as 

far as Rumsfeld is concerned, &quot;There already is an emergency.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The appearance of a successful test on Saturday would help 

this accelerated plan politically, although Rumsfeld said last 

month he wants deployment fast-tracked even without successful 

results. Critics charge the plan announced this week amounts to stealth deployment, obviating Congressional oversight and 

disregarding procurement rules on testing major systems. 

Ineffective, destabilizing and enormously expensive, missile 

defense risks voiding existing arms control agreements, touching 

off a new nuclear arms race and weaponizing space, they say, 

damaging rather than strengthening American security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amid a tightening budgetary climate, proposed 2002 allocation 

for missile defense would be increased $3 billion to $8.3 

billion to pay for the accelerated program. Opponents say in 

addition to possibly violating procurement rules, such an 

allocation would take needed funds from more beneficial 

programs. For the additional $3 billion the Pentagon wants to 

accelerate missile defense programs next year, 500,584 children 

could be enrolled in Head Start, 42,857 affordable housing units 

could be built, 2,226,973 uninsured children could receive 

health insurance, or 28,290 new teachers could be hired. </font></p>
