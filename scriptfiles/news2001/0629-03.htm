- June 29 - The following is a 

statement by Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger on Tom 

Delay's &quot;predatory&quot; telemarketing tactics: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sinister fundraising campaign conducted by the National 

Republican Congressional Committee and Majority Whip Tom DeLay 

sounds like a classic boiler room telemarketing scam. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doctors are being told over the phone that they have been 

selected to be 'honorary co-chairman' of something called the 

'Physician's Advisory Board.' This board is represented to be some 

kind of prestigious public policy panel -- where issues of the day 

like HMOs and health care financing will be deliberated. Only 

later in the pitch are the doctors told that it's just that -- a 

pitch for money, and a partisan one at that. Tom DeLay isn't 

interested in their advice. He just wants their money. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's like being told you 'may already have won' a million 

dollars and then -- after buying some magazines you don't really 

want -- you find out you didn't even get the cubic zirconia or the 

set of steak knives. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These practices are predatory, deceptive, and downright sleazy. 

They are blurring the lines between official business and political 

fundraising in a way that puts real pressure on the donor: It's 

like an offer you can't refuse. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hope Representative Tom Davis, the NRCC chairman, reins in Mr. 

DeLay and puts a stop to this dodgy practice. </font></p>

<p></p>
