- May 16 - The California Public Employee Retirement System (Calpers) posted on its website today its decisions to support contentious shareholder proposals challenging ExxonMobil's stance on global warming, responsiveness to environmental issues and calling on the company to move toward renewable energy. CalPERS is the nation's largest public pension fund with assets totaling more than $170 billion. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is clear that investors are beginning to understand that ExxonMobil's &quot;head in the sand&quot; approach on global warming is not in their best interest,&quot; said Patricia A. Daly, of the Dominican Sisters of New Jersey. &quot;There is a liability with the company's position and shareholders are beginning to understand that.&quot; Daly filed the shareholder resolution calling for links between executive compensation and environmental and social performance. Daly&sup1;s resolution also included charges that ExxonMobil&sup1;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lee R. Raymond had attempted to mislead shareholders about global warming in the 2000 shareholder meeting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ExxonMobil has twiddled its thumbs while its competitors have seized the initiative in clean energy increasingly in demand around the world,&quot; said Peter Altman, National Coordinator of Campaign ExxonMobil. &quot;Calpers is clearly sending a signal that it is time for this company to begin preparing for a clean energy future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The executive compensation proposal asks the company to onsider non-financial factors, including social and environmental concerns, in determining compensation for top executives. The renewables resolution asks the company to develop a policy to promote renewable energy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Calpers website says the fund supports the renewables resolution because &quot;the proposal is not unduly prescriptive. It mainly asks the company to advise the shareholders regularly &quot;as to the ways our Company is moving from its self-stated 'insignificant percentage of the company's business' in renewable energy resources to the promotion and marketing of renewables&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Calpers also announced its support for a report on the impacts of drilling in the Arctic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year ExxonMobil's Annual General Meeting is May 30th. At last year's meeting, 7.7% of shareholders voted in support of the executive compensation resolution. 6.2% of shareholders voted for the renewable energy resolutions. The SEC only requires a 3% vote for proposals to be brought back a second year. This year will be the second both proposals are put before shareholders. </font></p>
