- January 8 -  Every year in the United States  25 million pounds of valuable antibiotics --  roughly 70 percent of total US antibiotic  production -- are fed to chickens, pigs, and  cows for nontherapeutic purposes like growth  promotion, according to a new report from the  Union of Concerned Scientists. This finding  -- 50 percent greater than the estimate of  the livestock industry for all animal uses --  is the first transparent estimate of the  quantities of antibiotics used in meat  production.

<p>The report is also the first to show that the  quantities of antibiotics used in animal  agriculture dwarf those used in human  medicine. Nontherapeutic livestock use in  chickens, pigs, and cows accounts for 8 times  more antibiotics than human medicine, which  is using only 3 million pounds per year. </p>

<p>"The meat industry's share of the  antibiotic-resistance problem has been  ignored for too long," said Dr. Margaret  Mellon, Director of the Food and Environment  Program at UCS and co-author of the new  report. "Antibiotics are a precious resource  and should be used in animals only when  necessary." </p>

<p>Until now, health officials and citizens had  to rely on incomplete industry estimates to  design effective responses to the  antibiotic-resistance problem. According to  the new UCS report, "Hogging It: Estimates of  Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock," the total  use of antibiotics in healthy livestock has  climbed from 16 million pounds in the  mid-1980s to 25 million pounds today. Of  that, approximately 10 million pounds are  used in hogs, 11 million pounds in poultry,  and 4 million pounds in cattle.   </p>

<p>"The excessive use of antibiotics by the  livestock industry is sobering," said Dr.  Charles Benbrook, an independent economist  and co-author of the report. "Feeding  antibiotics to animals from birth to  slaughter may modestly improve meat industry  profits, but it puts everyone's health at  risk.  It is time to rethink how pigs, cattle  and poultry are raised in the United States." </p>

<p>Available industry data appear to  underestimate the usage of antibiotics and  are far too general to help scientists  explore the linkages between drug use in  livestock and the spread of resistance. With  no government-backed data available, the  authors of the report devised a methodology  for calculating antibiotic use in livestock  operations from publicly available  information, including herd size, approved  drug lists, and dosages. The researchers  acknowledge the need for more complete,  up-to-date data on livestock antibiotic  use. They invite the pharmaceutical industry,  which holds the production data, and the  animal livestock industry, which could  compile usage information, to bring better  data to the public arena.  But new data must  be transparent and verifiable.  </p>

<p>"The public has been flying blind," said  Mellon. "The government should act now to  collect the needed data. The price of  complacency could set us back to an era where  untreatable infectious diseases are  regrettably commonplace." </p>

<p>UCS recommends that the Food and Drug  Administration establish a system to compel  companies that sell antibiotics for livestock  use to provide annual reports on the quantity  of these drugs sold. The US Department of  Agriculture should improve the completeness  and accuracy of its periodic surveys of  antibiotic use in livestock. The FDA, USDA,  and Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention should speed up implementation of  its government-wide action plan, which calls  for the establishment of monitoring systems  and the assessment of ways to collect and  protect the confidentiality of usage data. </p>

<p>The FDA, which oversees the approval and  cancellation of veterinary drugs, will  discuss the use of antimicrobial drugs in  food animals at a public meeting, January  22-24. </p>

The term antimicrobial  encompasses substances, whether naturally  occurring or synthetically produced, directed  against all microorganisms.  Antibiotic is a  narrower term that some scientists reserve  for only naturally occurring substances that  destroy or inhibit the growth of bacteria. </i>
