- July 6 - The large increases in the number of same-sex unmarried partner households being reported in the 2000 census are real, despite a recent advisory from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Human Rights Campaign said today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that the Census Bureau's admission that it arbitrarily recategorized some people in the 1990 census had an effect, but we also believe that the increases we're seeing now are real, as more and more couples are willing to answer the government honestly,&quot; said David M. Smith, HRC's communications director and senior strategist. &quot;These data are providing researchers and policy makers with a wealth of information on a heretofore unrecognized constituency.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After reporting more than a third of the states' statistics on same-sex unmarried partner households, the U.S. Census Bureau issued a &quot;technical note&quot; June 29 suggesting that it was inaccurate to compare the 2000 same-sex unmarried partner household data to the same 1990 data. Census officials said in the note that same-sex partners who checked off the &quot;spouse&quot; box in 1990 were reallocated to other categories, while households that did the same in 2000 were reallocated to the &quot;unmarried partner&quot; category. According to the note, the census &quot;advises that for some analyses -- those involving unmarried same-sex partners -- direct comparison of the 1990 and 2000 estimates is not substantively valid.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1990, the Census Bureau termed it an error if both the householder and a second adult in the house were of the same-sex and the second person checked the box &quot;spouse&quot; and also checked the &quot;married&quot; box. In these cases, the Census Bureau changed the sex of the second person in the household. When the same scenario occurred in 2000, census officials reclassified such couples as same-sex unmarried partners. Thus, census officials claimed the 1990 data cannot be compared directly to the 2000 data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Census officials have said that they do not know how many couples in 1990 were reclassified in this manner. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sadly, the effect of the census action in 1990 rendered a substantial number of gay families invisible,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It is our sincere hope that data provided in the 2000 census will provide compelling arguments for enacting public policy that treats gay and lesbian couples fairly and equally.&quot; Smith noted several examples of inequities, such as equal marriage rights, hospital visitation rights, pension benefits and inheritance rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community.</font></p>
