<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOS ANGELES - November 8 - A Los Angeles Federal court agreed  yesterday to delay the November 20 trial date of 15  Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists facing  felony charges arising from a peaceful protest against the  proposed missile defense agenda. The defense lawyers  asked for a continuance of the court date during a hearing  on November 5 because of the political climate in the United  States following the September 11 attacks on the World  Trade Center. The trial is now scheduled to begin on  January 8, 2002. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The charges relate to a peaceful protest at Vandenberg  Airforce Base California against the last test of the Star  Wars missile system on July 14, 2001. The test was  delayed for forty minutes.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The activists facing trial are from Australia, Canada,  Germany, India New Zealand, Sweden, the UK and the  United States. The journalists are from the UK and Spain.  

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

During the hearing on November 5, an additional  Greenpeace activist, Henk Haazen, joined the case by  pleading activist pleaded not guilty to the charges. The New  Zealand based Greenpeace activist will now face trial  alongside the other defendants. Haazen flew from Auckland  to Los Angeles and voluntarily turned himself in to the FBI  on October 31 after he was named in a superseding  indictment. He was granted bail and released from custody  the following day. He will remain in the central district of  California until the trial. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Both the activists and the freelance journalists who were  documenting the protest face the following charges: 

</font>

<p>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Conspiring to willfully and knowingly violate an order and  direction from a Captain of the Port of the U.S. Coast  Guard regarding a safety zone, knowingly enter  Vandenberg Air Force Base without permission, and  aiding and abetting each other, a Class D felony with a  maximum six year prison term and $250,000 fine.
