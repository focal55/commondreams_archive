- October 11 - From coast to coast, this weekend thousands of Sierra Club

volunteers will rally their neighbors to protect America's National Forests

and local treasures closer to home.  In 40 cities  volunteers will hand out

400,000 postcards, talk to neighbors door-to-door, speak at festivals and

lead community tours of threatened parks and steams to celebrate and

protect America's beautiful lands.  Sierra Club Chapters are urging local

officials to protect threatened areas that include:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;    In Oregon, the Tillamook and Clatsop state forests, which are

endangered by increased logging;

&middot;    In Michigan, the Great Lakes, which are polluted by animal waste from

factory farms;

&middot;    In South Dakota, the Missouri River, which is shrinking due to dam

building, wetlands destruction and alteration of natural water flows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to reaching out personally to their neighbors, Sierra Club

chapters are running radio ads in 20 cities, calling attention to the

threats facing their local gems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans face a choice ? to safeguard our natural heritage or lose it

forever,&quot; said Sierra Club President Jennifer Ferenstein.  &quot;Our nation has

the opportunity to protect the places our communities love.  The Sierra

Club stands ready to offer real solutions that will help people protect

America's natural treasures.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sierra Club volunteers are also urging public officials to protect our last

wild, unspoiled National Forest areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are calling on our public officials to protect the last fragments of

pristine National Forest.  These forests provide essential sources of clean

drinking water, wildlife habitat, and special places to hike, hunt camp and

fish.  Our last wild forests are national treasures, and are important

places to rejuvenate and draw inspiration,&quot; Ferenstein said.  &quot;Local

communities overwhelmingly recognize the value of these forests and our

officials should act to protect America's environment for our families, for

our future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The popular wild forest protection policy, which would protect nearly 60

million pristine acres of National Forests from logging, mining and other

destruction, was finalized by the U.S. Forest Service in January after the

largest public involvement process in the history of federal rulemakings.

To date, the Forest Service has received more than 2 million comments

calling for full protection of our last wild forests. The Forest Service is

considering weakening the rule and opening the door to logging and

roadbuilding in our last wild forests.
