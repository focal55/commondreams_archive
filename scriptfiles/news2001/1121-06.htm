<p>JIM JENNINGS, <a href="mailto:conscience@usa.com">conscience@usa.com</a><br>

President of Conscience International, a humanitarian aid organization, 

Jennings was in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan this May and will soon 

return to resume humanitarian work. He said today: "The humanitarian crisis 

in Afghanistan is far from over -- millions still face starvation and 

disease. The sudden expansion of Northern Alliance territories, although 

opening the possibility of deliveries from the north, actually stopped the 

food convoys from Pakistan and Iran for several days because truck drivers 

are reluctant to travel into a militarily volatile situation.... Meanwhile, 

the humanitarian effort is losing precious days, a critical factor because 

of the onset of winter. For every day lost now, some people will die down 

the line."



<p>SARAH ZAIDI, <a href="mailto:szaidi@cesr.org">szaidi@cesr.org</a><br>

ROGER NORMAND, <a href="mailto:rnormand@cesr.org">rnormand@cesr.org</a>, <a href="http://www.cesr.org" target="_new">http://www.cesr.org</a><br>

Currently in Pakistan, Zaidi is research director of the Center for 

Economic and Social Rights. She said today: "The biggest obstacle to the 

relief effort is now posed by U.S. partners. Northern Alliance warlords 

have sabotaged supply routes inside Afghanistan, while Pakistan and other 

neighboring countries continue to seal their borders and prevent desperate 

people from reaching food and safety. Rather than seeking to score PR 

points, the U.S. military should pressure its allies to allow free movement 

to Afghans and to UN and private relief agencies. Ensuring that thousands 

of Afghans do not starve to death this winter is both a moral imperative 

and a human rights obligation for all parties who have contributed to the 

crisis -- including the United States." CESR's executive director Normand 

said today: "The Geneva Conventions and Red Cross regulations mandate that 

relief aid be neutral, impartial and motivated solely by humanitarian 

concerns. But so far the U.S. military has viewed the food crisis in 

Afghanistan -- which our bombing helped create -- as a domestic PR 

opportunity. Independent relief agencies have condemned our military policy 

of dropping food into heavily-mined areas as not only ineffective and 

dangerous, but also a distraction from the unglamorous but crucial work of 

distributing the huge amounts of staple goods necessary to feed millions of 

hungry people."



<p>ERWIN VAN'T LAND, <a href="mailto:msfh_isl_rep@yahoo.com">msfh_isl_rep@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org" target="_new">http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org</a><br>

Spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders (which has 30 international aid 

workers inside Afghanistan), Erwin van't Land is in Islamabad. He said 

today: "Humanitarian work should be carried out by civilian agencies and 

should be completely independent of military considerations.... The 

situation deteriorated during the past two months of bombing, as large 

parts of the Afghan population dependent on international aid for survival 

did not receive it."



<p>JOHN DAVISON, <a href="mailto:jdaviso@christian-aid.org">jdaviso@christian-aid.org</a>, <a href="http://www.christian-aid.org" target="_new">http://www.christian-aid.org</a><br>

Spokesperson for Christian Aid, Davison recently arrived in London from 

Afghanistan. He said today: "The main routes we had managed to establish 

were coming in through Pakistan and lately virtually nothing is getting in 

-- I believe only a single convoy got in yesterday.... Soon it will get to 

the point that the trucks won't go out at all because of fears of getting 

stuck in the snow.... Everyone is glad that the Taliban have mostly lost 

power but the recent developments have demonstrated the lifesaving 

importance of the pause in the bombing that we and six other major 

international aid agencies had called for -- our call went unheeded and now 

we face this crisis. In the Western and Central Highlands where we carry 

out most of our work, about 80 percent of the population is very 

vulnerable.... Food is very short and people are trying desperately to get 

out and they have no means of transportation. That's hundreds of thousands 

of people facing starvation."
