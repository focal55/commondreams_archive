- January 25 - With today's revelation in the Washington Post that

John Ashcroft as governor of Missouri asked a job applicant about his

sexual orientation, George W. Bush's nominee for attorney general has

once again failed the plausibility test regarding his true views on

the issue of workplace equity.

<p>

Ashcroft has repeatedly claimed that he would not discriminate on the

basis of sexual orientation, that he did not in fact block Ambassador

James Hormel's nomination because of Hormel’s sexual orientation,

and that he does not recall being asked to sign a nondiscrimination 

policy as a member of the U.S. Senate.

<p>

"It is important that the nation's highest-ranking law enforcement

official tell the truth," said Elizabeth Toledo, executive director

of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "We urge members of the

Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate whether John Ashcroft has

responded truthfully to the questions that have been put to him."

<p>

On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that a health care expert

who applied for a top Cabinet post in Missouri's state government

says he was asked by Ashcroft about his sexual orientation. The

applicant contends that Ashcroft's very first question was, "do you

have the same sexual preference as most men?"

<p>

Through a spokeswoman, Ashcroft said he "cannot imagine" questioning

a job applicant about his sexual orientation. Despite historical

evidence to the contrary, Ashcroft claims that sexual orientation

will not be a factor in hiring at the Department of Justice.

<p>

As a member of the U.S. Senate, Ashcroft repeatedly declined to sign

a pledge that he would not discriminate against gay or lesbian

employees in his Senate office. Asked why during his confirmation

hearing, Ashcroft replied, "I don’t have any recollection about

this statement, and frankly, I'd have to answer, 'I don’t know and

I don't have any recollection of that.'"

<p>

Ashcroft also denied that he held up Hormel's nomination as ambassador

to Luxembourg because of Hormel's sexual orientation. But news accounts

from 1998 have surfaced in which Ashcroft was quoted as objecting to

Hormel's "gay lifestyle."

<p>

"Three strikes, he's out," Toledo said. "Ashcroft seems to be experiencing

either amnesia or an inability to be forthright. His comments on the

Hormel nomination, the nondiscrimination policy that he was asked to sign

and now on the applicant he interviewed for a post in the Missouri state 

government do not pass the plausibility test. Members of the Senate

Judiciary Committee should take this into consideration - as should the

entire U.S. Senate - when they decide the fate of Mr. Ashcroft's nomination."
