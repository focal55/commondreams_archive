- September 6 - &quot;Once again, the U.S. Forest Service has received

mountains of letters from Americans asking that the last wild areas in our

National Forests be protected for future generations, not sacrificed for

short term profits. As the latest public comment period draws to close,

conservation groups will deliver another estimated 400,000 comments to the

Forest Service, bringing the total number of letters and comments delivered

on the Roadless Area Conservation Rule to more than two million. Yet

President Bush continues his efforts to pay back his campaign contributors

by opening our last wild forests to the timber industry. The president

should listen to Americans and stop playing politics with our natural

treasures.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;From Alaska's Tongass rainforest to the Florida pine forests, citizens

calling for wild forest protection vastly outnumbered those opposed. People

want these areas saved for hunting, fishing, camping, and providing clean

water forever--not sacrificed for the profit of the timber and mining

industries. President Bush should listen to Americans and fully implement

the popular Roadless Area Conservation Rule.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Forest Service spent years developing the roadless protection policy,

instituting the largest public involvement process in history. The Forest

Service held more than 600 public hearings around the nation and received

more than one and a half million comments over the first two public comment

periods. Despite the tremendous public support for protecting wild forests,

President Bush is considering weakening the historic conservation plan and

reopening our last wild forests to logging and other destructive

activities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If fully implemented, the Roadless Area Conservation Rule would protect

nearly 60 million acres of the most pristine areas in our National Forests

from most logging and road building. These increasingly scarce unspoiled

places are crucial for providing quality hunting and fishing, for

protecting watersheds that supply drinking water, for offering magnificent

scenery and providing backcountry recreation.&quot;
