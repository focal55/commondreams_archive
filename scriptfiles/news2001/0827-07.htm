has been pulled off the air by Pacifica management, and the 

show's producers and award-winning host, Amy Goodman, have been 

suspended without pay. A statement from Goodman's union, the 

American Federation of Television & Radio Artists, released 

August 23, reads, "AFTRA has notified Pacifica that it is no 

longer satisfied that the WBAI studios are a safe and appropriate 

working environment for the Democracy Now! staff."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In protest against the attacks on Democracy Now, listeners at 

all five Pacifica radio stations will take to the streets on 

Tuesday, August 28 in support of the show. "We will not stand 

by while the Pacifica management tries to get rid of the last 

progressive national radio show in the United States. Concerned 

listeners throughout the country will rise up in defense of our 

show and our radio network," said Andrea Buffa, executive 

director of Media Alliance in San Francisco. Media Alliance 

(<a href="http://www.media-alliance.org" target="_new">www.media-alliance.org</a>) and the Pacifica Campaign 

(<a href="http://www.pacificacampaign.org" target="_new">www.pacificacampaign.org</a>) put out a call for the protests 

last week.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At WBAI, the Democracy Now! staff have been physically and 

verbally attacked by interim station manager Utrice Leid and 

other WBAI staff members. When Pacifica senior management 

repeatedly ignored the Democracy Now staff's written requests 

that something be done about the intolerable atmosphere of 

intimidation and threats, the DN staff felt they had no choice 

but to fashion some interim solution. Last week they began 

producing Democracy Now from Downtown Community Television 

in Manhattan. But Pacifica has refused to air the shows that 

are produced at this alternative location.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pacifica Foundation has been embattled in recent years as 

more and more listeners and staff members have accused the 

organization's leadership of censorship, misuse of funds, and 

illegal changes to the organization's structure. The situation 

exploded in the summer of 1999 when Pacifica board members and 

national managers locked the journalists out of KPFA radio in 

Berkeley for three weeks using armed security guards. It exploded 

again in December 2000 when Pacifica locked out journalists and 

fired long-time staff members at WBAI radio in New York City.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three separate lawsuits have been filed against Pacifica: by 

Pacifica local advisory board members, Pacifica listener-sponsors, 

and five Pacifica national board members. Freelance journalists 

are on strike against the Pacifica Network News, because Pacifica 

managers have censored the newscasts and retaliated against 

journalists who insisted on the editorial integrity of the national 

news department.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now! is Pacifica's most popular and influential show. It 

has recently broken major stories on a host of controversial issues, 

including Chevron's role in Nigeria, the Lori Berenson case, and 

East Timor. But rather than supporting the show and promoting it, 

Pacifica management has repeatedly attacked the show. In January 2001, 

Goodman's co-host, Juan Gonzalez, quit the show on-air and announced 

that he would form the Pacifica Campaign, a national corporate 

campaign to oust Pacifica Radio's board of directors. Since that time, 

five of the Pacifica Board members have resigned.
