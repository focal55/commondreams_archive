- February 13 - The White House has teamed up with large pharmaceutical firms against innovative AIDS treatment efforts already credited with saving many thousands of lives in Brazil.

<P>"When Brazil decided to provide the generic drugs free to all its AIDS victims, it disproved the argument that poor countries couldn't master the complex regime of AIDS pills," the Feb. 12 edition of <I>Time</I> magazine reported. "The government set up effective clinics."</P>

<P>But the Bush administration is seeking to impede Brazil's AIDS program by pursuing a U.S. complaint with the World Trade Organization. That dispute is part of a broader battle, against generic AIDS drugs, being waged in Asia, Africa and Latin

America by big pharmaceutical firms. The Feb. 12 <I>Guardian</I> newspaper in London reported: "On behalf of the industry the U.S. government is taking the offensive to Brazil, which has had dramatic success in manufacturing its own cheap copies of patented drugs and now exports generics."</P>



<P>The following policy analysts are available for interviews about efforts to block low-cost AIDS drugs:</P>



<P><LI>ROBERT NAIMAN, <A HREF="mailto:naiman@cepr.net">

naiman@cepr.net</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cepr.net">www.cepr.net</A><BR>

A senior policy analyst at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, Naiman said today: "The U.S. government decision to challenge efforts to make AIDS drugs affordable in Brazil at the World Trade Organization is disturbing for

several reasons. It indicates that despite lofty rhetoric in Washington about the importance of fighting the scourge of AIDS in poor countries, the priorities of the pharmaceutical lobby still take precedence in U.S. policy over the lives of millions. It also illustrates the danger of lodging dispute resolution and enforcement powers in institutions like the WTO; the clear intent of the agreement on intellectual property claims in the WTO was to allow

countries not to honor patents in a public health emergency, which AIDS obviously is. Yet pharmaceutical corporations, acting through the U.S. government, can still use the WTO's procedures to try to intimidate developing countries from exercising their rights and fulfilling their responsibilities to the public."

<P><LI>ASIA RUSSELL, <A HREF="mailto:asia@critpath.org">asia@critpath.org</A>,

<A HREF="http://www.healthgap.org"> www.healthgap.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.globaltreatmentaccess.org"> www.globaltreatmentaccess.org</A><BR>

Russell is an activist with the Health GAP Coalition. She said today: "Instead of touting the Brazil program as a model, the Bush administration -- arm in arm with the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry -- has confronted the life-extending efforts of Brazil with a trade dispute that will absolutely jeopardize their critical access program.... At the end of the day, mammoth

multinational drug companies are desperately scared that other countries will follow Brazil's lead and make aggressive efforts to generate low drug prices through generic competition. They have enlisted the U.S. government to call out the dogs on Brazil, in the face of the life and death needs of poor people with AIDS.... The deep allegiance of the Bush administration to the drug industry

has resulted in pursuit of a morally bankrupt WTO dispute."
