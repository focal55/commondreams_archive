- March 1 - Public Citizen is urging the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

(FDA) to investigate quality control problems at a New Jersey plant owned by

pharmaceutical giant Schering-Plough.

<p>In <a href="http://www.citizen.org/hrg/publications/1559.htm">a letter sent today</a>

to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, Public Citizen urges

the FDA to look into manufacturing practices associated with asthma inhalers and other

drugs. During the past 15 months, the drug manufacturer has been forced to recall 59

million asthma inhalers because many units lacked the active ingredient. </p>



<p>Documents obtained by Public Citizen show that external auditors last year found

significant problems at Schering-Plough&#146;s Kenilworth, N.J., plant, and that more

recently, FDA inspectors who visited the plant found that similar manufacturing problems

still existed.</p>



<p>Auditors of AAC Consulting Group of Rockville, Md., visited Schering-Plough&#146;s

Kenilworth plant between Feb. 28, 2000, and April 14, 2000. They were extremely critical

of the general attitude of managers, who told them about &quot;an imbalance between

quality and production, leaning considerably toward production.&quot; </p>



<p>The problems with the inhalers indicate &quot;insufficient technical expertise and

managerial oversight,&quot; the auditors wrote.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in a recent 31-day FDA inspection of the same facility, which was completed

on Jan. 19, inspectors found similar quality control problems and concluded that

&quot;[t]he process validation for many products fails to support claims that

manufacturing processes were capable of consistently producing products with the same

quality, purity, and safety.&quot;</p>



<p>The problems found by the FDA inspection are so serious that some production lines have

been temporarily halted and the company will not be allowed by the FDA to gain approval of

or start shipping Clarinex, its new allergy drug, as planned. FDA investigators found

&quot;no assurance that the manufacturing process, parameters, equipment or protocols . .

. conducted at multiple sites for the production of Clarinex . . . are equivalent or

capable of producing product of the same quality.&quot;</p>



<p>In the letter, Public Citizen asks the FDA to consider whether criminal charges are

warranted because of the possibility that the company was aware of the quality control

problems when it shipped some of the defective inhalers. The FDA also should investigate

the drug manufacturer for continuing to ship other prescription drug products while aware

of the manufacturing problems, Public Citizen wrote.</p>



<p>&quot;The practices uncovered are dangerously sloppy and threaten the health of

consumers,&quot; said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Health

Research Group. &quot;The auditors essentially found that the practices at the plant are

so poor that there&#146;s no guarantee that drugs have the right amount of active

ingredients, or that they are manufactured consistently enough to ensure that they contain

what they purport to contain. This is no way to run a drug company.&quot;
