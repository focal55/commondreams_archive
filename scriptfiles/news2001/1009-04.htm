- October 9 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) through its

Emergency and Material Assistance Program (EMAP) is seeking donations of

clean, serviceable blankets to send to Afghanistan refugees in Pakistan and

Iran who have been displaced by military action.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With winter coming on, the most immediate need is for warm blankets,&quot;

explained Carlos Mejia EMAP director. &quot;We are seeking individual donations

and also larger, corporate in-kind contributions.  We hope for a quick

response so that we can ship them as soon as possible.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afghanistan has one of the largest refugee populations in the world, making

the situation a humanitarian crisis of &quot;stunning proportions,&quot; according to

the United Nations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have already sent 375 bales of blankets to distribute to refugees in

Iran,&quot; adds Michael Poulshock, EMAP interim assistant director.  &quot;Because

the situation in and around Afghanistan is so fluid an AFSC representative

will also travel to Pakistan to conduct both a short and long term needs

assessment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poulshock, who previously served as the AFSC field coordinator in Kosovo

between 1999 and 2000 went on to explain, &quot; The Emergency and Material

Assistance Program (EMAP) is now in its 80th year of operation and provides

relief after disasters, both natural and man-made, and works directly and

with partner agencies, including the Mennonite Central Committee, a relief,

service, and peace agency of the North American Mennonite and Brethren in

Christ churches.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blankets may be brought to the AFSC collection center in Philadelphia,

Pennsylvania, or to one of the regional centers in Baltimore, Maryland;

Cambridge, Massachusetts; High Point, North Carolina; Richmond, Indiana; or

San Francisco, California. </font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effort is a part of AFSC No More Victims campaign, which was launched to

help victims and survivors of the September 11 tragedies. The campaign

supports work on the ground in New York and Washington, DC, helps assist

Afghan refugees fleeing their homes for safety, and mobilizes support for

peaceful solutions - not violence and retaliation - in the face of those

terrible acts of anger and hatred and the suffering they caused.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cash donations may be directed to AFSC No More Victims-Afghan Relief  and

mailed to AFSC/Development, 1501 Cherry Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102. To

contribute via Visa or Mastercard, call 1-888-588-2372, ext. 1.  For more
