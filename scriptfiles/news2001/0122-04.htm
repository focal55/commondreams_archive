- January 22 - In response to news

reports that President George W. Bush will reinstate the

international gag rule by executive order today, the National

Women's Law Center decried the action and called it a move that

will endanger the health of women in developing counties.

<p>"If on his first day in office, President Bush chooses to

reinstate the gag rule, through executive order, he would be

adopting a harmful policy that will seriously affect women's

health. Reinstating the gag rule, along with the nomination of

Senator Ashcroft for Attorney General, would set an ominous tone

for women in this country and the security of their right to safe

and legal abortion and family planning more broadly," said Marcia

D. Greenberger, Co-President of NWLC. "The gag rule endangers the

health of women in developing counties resulting in more unwanted

pregnancies, more maternal deaths and more abortions. It is a

dangerous restriction for women worldwide."

<p>As part of its FY 2000 funding for international family planning

programs, Congress adopted the international gag rule preventing

recipients from using their own funds to provide abortions or

advocate for abortion rights before their own governments.

However, for FY 2001, former President Clinton negotiated an

agreement where Congress lifted the gag rule, but funding to family

planning organizations was suspended until Feb. 15, giving the new

president the opportunity to reinstate the restriction.

<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-profit organization

that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect women's

legal rights. The Center focuses on major policy areas of

importance to women and their families including economic security,

education, employment and health, with special attention given to

the concerns of low-income women.</i>
