<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - December 5 - The Sierra Club commends Senate Majority Leader Tom

Daschle (D-SD) for crafting an energy bill that -- in stark contrast to the

bill passed by the House -- is based on the premise that the best way to

ensure our energy security is through higher fuel economy standards and

greater use of renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

While the package begins to stake out a path to a safer, more secure energy

future, there is more that must be done and there are elements of the bill

that we urge the Senate to improve.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;House Republicans might think we can meet our energy needs by drilling our

public lands while magically protecting the environment, but this isn't

Harry Potter,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.

&quot;Senator Daschle's bill sets the framework for the real-world solutions

that will provide energy while protecting our environment at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Senator Daschle recognizes that reducing our oil dependence and improving

energy security can be achieved while protecting our precious public lands,

including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The bill also acknowledges

that our energy policy is directly linked to global warming, and addresses

the problem by including provisions that will begin to curb global warming

pollution,&quot; Pope continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although details are forthcoming, the bill recognizes that improving fuel

economy is the single most effective step that we can take to reduce our

dependence on oil, save consumers money, and cut global warming pollution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the package begins to stake out a path to a safer, cleaner, and

cheaper energy future, there is much more that must be done.  Some of the

toughest decisions remain to be resolved.  For example, still to be

determined are how much fuel economy standards will be raised, and what tax

incentives will be provided for clean energy technology.

This bill is moving in the right direction on renewable energy -- requiring

that 10 percent of our power be generated by renewable energy sources by

the year 2020 -- but more can and must be done.  A goal of 20 percent by

2020 is achievable and needed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of concern is that the bill continues to give huge subsidies to the

dangerous nuclear industry.  The Senate must make sure the final bill does

not include subsidies to either the nuclear or coal industries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Senator Daschle's bill recognizes that the best way to reduce America's

dependence on oil, coal, and nuclear energy is to reduce demand for them in

the first place,&quot; continued Pope. &quot;While the bill is not without its flaws,

it establishes a framework on which America can build a secure energy

future.  We look forward to working with the Senate to deliver on its

promise of an energy future for America that is cleaner, cheaper, safer and

more secure.&quot;</font></p>
