- June 5 -  "Today was the first step in a new dialogue with the Bush Administration

about America's energy policy.  We had a cordial exchange of ideas with the

Administration but we still have profound differences about our basic

beliefs about the best way to solve America's energy needs.  We continue to

be extremely disappointed with the President's "dig, drill and destroy" policy and hope to move him to a position that is better for all Americans.

We'll have to wait and see whether President Bush is sincere about finding

the best energy solutions.

<p>

"We offered the Administration a quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer energy

policy based on energy efficiency, renewable energy and responsible

additions to supply.  If  President Bush adopts our plan and robustly

implements it, we can provide Americans with energy without drilling the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, regressing back to dangerous nuclear

power, or weakening the Clean Air Act to burn more coal.

<p>

"During our discussion, we highlighted three key pillars of our energy

plan:  renewable energy, responsible increases in supply and energy

efficiency.  We urged the Administration to support a Renewable Portfolio

Standard (RPS), which would require 20 percent of our electricity derived

from clean, renewable energy by 2020.  They expressed a willingness to

continue a dialogue about adopting an RPS to promote solar, wind,

geothermal and biomass energy.

<p>

"We voiced our concern about pollution from power plants, urging the

Administration to support bi-partisan legislation that would cut dangerous

pollution.  But instead of committing to protecting our families, the

Administration again rejected curbing global warming pollution from power

plants.

<p>

"Finally, we asked the Administration to work to increase energy

efficiency, specifically by increasing miles-per-gallon standards for cars

and light trucks.  Raising fuel economy for cars and SUVs to 40 miles per

gallon is the biggest single step President Bush can take to cut oil

consumption and curb global warming.  The White House staff signaled it would await a forthcoming report on the miles-per-gallon standards from a

panel that is weighted heavily toward the auto and oil industries, without

any environmental representation.

<p>

"We look forward to continuing our dialogue with President Bush's

Administration.  While we will continue to have major differences about energy policy, we are hopeful that President Bush will adopt an energy plan

that is quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer than the one he proposed last

month."
