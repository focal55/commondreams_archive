- April 18 - As the Supreme

Court considers the first medical marijuana case this spring, an

advertising campaign that compares the relative harm of marijuana

and tobacco and alcohol will be on 36 bus shelters around the

nation's capitol. The campaign is being launched by Change the

Climate, a non-profit group of parents and business executives that

uses provocative transit advertising to stimulate debate about

marijuana policy.

<p>Unlike Change the Climate's METRO advertising campaign this past

January, the bus shelter campaign features only one ad. The

approximately 6 feet by 4 feet ad is black on a white background

and reads "America 1992 to 1999. 3.2 million tobacco deaths. 1.4

million alcohol deaths. 0 marijuana deaths. Tell us the truth

-- www.changetheclimate.org" A copy of the ad is available for

download at <a href="http://www.changetheclimate.org/news/dc.phtml">http://www.changetheclimate.org/news/dc.phtml.</a>

<p>"The goal of this ad campaign," says founder Joseph White, "is

to inform people about the human costs associated with tobacco,

alcohol and marijuana. The contrast is rather stark." White adds

that "This ad is part of our 'Truth Campaign' that seeks to balance

government advertising that often associates marijuana so closely

with hard drugs."

<p>Change the Climate hopes that people will see the ads and log

onto the organization's website <a href="http://www.changetheclimate.org">(http://www.changetheclimate.org)</a>

to learn more about marijuana issues, to see the organization's

other marijuana reform ads, to participate in the online bulletin

board and to make contributions to buy more ads in other cities.

<p>Online Ad Campaign on 100+ College-based Websites

<p>Starting April 18th and continuing through May 4th, Change the

Climate is conducting an advertising campaign online with the

purchase of 500,000 impressions in an effort to get college

students involved in marijuana reform. White points out that

"College campuses are a place for discussion and debate. Our

advertising campaign with The Daily Jolt <a href="http://www.dailyjolt.com">(http://www.dailyjolt.com)</a>

will reach over a hundred colleges during the next three weeks. As

part of the campaign, the Daily Jolt is hosting a marijuana forum

across all participating campus websites.

<p>"Our goal," White continues, "is to get students involved.

Students are the target of government advertising campaigns -- the

campaigns that make young people cynical and distrustful of adults.

We encourage parents and other adults to visit the online forum

from April 18 to May 4." The forum address is:

<a href="http://www.dailyjolt.com/forum/issues/marijuana/">www.dailyjolt.com/forum/issues/marijuana/</a>

<p>"When parents learn that their children are ineligible for

federal student loans if they get busted for pot but the guy who

raped a girl or robbed a bank still gets his student loan, they'll

be up in arms," exclaims White who has spent hours talking to

parents of kids who've been arrested for marijuana. Change the

Climate is also working with Students for a Sensible Drug Policy

<a href="http://www.ssdp.org">http://www.ssdp.org</a> on this campaign.

<p>The only other campaign is in Boston where it has been

temporarily delayed by an ACLU-sponsored First Amendment lawsuit

against the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) for not

agreeing to display the organization's ads. A decision on that

case is expected soon. New campaigns are being prepared for

Chicago and New York.

<p>Change the Climate's strategy is based on the realization that

politicians will not support marijuana reform until the climate

around marijuana is more favorable. Just as businesses invest in

advertising to change consumer behavior, Change the Climate

believes millions of advertising impressions will begin to change

public opinion.
