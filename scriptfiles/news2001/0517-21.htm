- May 17 - As the Senate debates the $1.35 trillion tax cut package, Billionaires for <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlimited Inheritance, a coalition of the mega-rich, are urging the Senate 

to pass the measure without delay.  They are particularly pleased that the 

legislation on the floor will abolish the estate tax, thus helping them to 

keep vast wealth accumulating within their families for generations.  The 

only potential pitfall the billionaires can imagine in this profitable 

scheme would be if the rabble call their Senators to object.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Republican and Democratic conventions this summer, the Billionaires 

were out in full force, holding a Million Billionaire March to demonstrate 

their influence over the candidates and show off their fiscal prowess.  They 

were featured in the Washington Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, Boston Globe, 

BBC, Time Magazine, and several major networks in Philadelphia and Los 

Angeles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the election season was over, the Billionaires began to focus on 

winning tax cuts for themselves, particularly the abolition of the estate 

tax.  &quot;A tax aimed at the top 2% is a tax aimed at us,&quot; said co-chair Phil 

T. Rich.  &quot;We&#146;ve paid far too much in campaign contributions to pay these 

taxes as well!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moreover,&quot; added co-chair Robert Baron, &quot;how can we cultivate a sense of 

entitlement in our children if we can&#146;t promise them massive untaxed 

inheritances?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rich added that the cooperation of both parties has proved vital in the tax 

package&#146;s progress thus far.  &quot;Four Democratic Senators supported this bill 

in the Senate Finance Committee.  It shows the wisdom of our buy-partisan 

strategy of buying both Democrats and Republicans.  This way, we always 

win!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baron concluded that all looked rosy for the billionaires, as long as no 

lowly constituents call their Senators today at (202) 224-3121 to urge them 

to preserve the estate tax.  &quot;I suppose that a large upsurge of opposition 

from the rabble could get in our way,&quot; said Baron.  &quot;But we trust that no 

one will bother to call their Senators.  There are good programs on TV this 

week, and we urge everyone to watch those instead!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives of Billionaires for Unlimited Inheritance are always 

available for interviews. More information about the organization is

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Billionaires for Unlimited Inheritance is a non-partisan spoof created by 

United for a Fair Economy to draw attention to the connection between estate 

tax repeal, campaign finance, and economic inequality</i>.</font></p>
