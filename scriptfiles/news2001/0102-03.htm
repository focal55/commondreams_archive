- January 2 - Leaving rhetoric about a bipartisan administration and claims

of being a 'uniter, not a divider' in the dust, President-Elect

George W. Bush has disregarded the recent election results and the

American public which favored Vice President Al Gore, Jr. His

naming of arch-conservatives past and present to his cabinet will



cease and reverse progress made for the last decade on key



environmental, disarmament and violence prevention policies.

<p>"From John Ashcroft and Gale Norton to Tommy Thompson and even



on to Christine Todd Whitman, President-Elect Bush has assembled a



wrecking crew to tear down the valuable progress we've made toward



a safer world," said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., Executive Director and



CEO of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR). "Key policies



like continued support from the Departments of Justice and Heath



and Human Services for initiatives to protect us from handgun



violence and the Environmental Protection Agency's concern for

regulating public health threats will be rolled back under these



unsuitable cabinet selections."

<p>President-Elect Bush's selection of former Secretary of Defense



Donald Rumsfeld, whose revolving-door connections to the



military-industrial complex and opposition to any meaningful



disarmament efforts are well documented, is a major disaster.



Rumsfeld, unless opposed, will help launch a new arms race by



pursuing the National Missile Defense program. Rumsfeld also



announced that he will pursue a system to defend our space-based



assets, opening new avenues for reckless military spending and



dangerous international brinkmanship.

<p>"To name as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who testified



against the chemical weapons convention, who opposed the



Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, who opposed the SALT II arms



agreement, who lobbied for the B-2 Bomber and the MX Missile, is to



wish this county back into its darkest times," said Musil. "America



doesn't need to relive the Cold War. We were lucky to survive it



the first time through."

PSR, which represents 22,000 physicians and health professionals



nationwide and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, will oppose the



confirmation of a number of Bush cabinet-designees, focusing



particularly on Attorney General designee Ashcroft, Secretary of



the Interior designee Norton and Secretary of Health and Human



Services designee Thompson.
