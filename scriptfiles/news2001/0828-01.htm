cuts in a decade, top executives continue to enjoy exorbitant pay hikes,

according to a new report, "Executive Excess 2001."  The report is the

eighth annual CEO pay study by the Institute for Policy Studies and United

for a Fair Economy.



<p>CEOs of firms that announced layoffs of 1,000 or more workers this year

earned about 80% more, on average, than executives at 365 top firms surveyed

by Business Week.  These layoff leaders averaged $23.7 million in total

compensation in 2000, compared with $13.1 million for CEOs as a whole.



<p>The top job-cutters received an increase in salary and bonus of nearly 20%

in 2000, compared to average raises in that year for U.S. wage workers of

about 3% and for salaried employees of 4%. Overall CEO pay also rose in 2000

despite the 10% drop in the S&P 500.



<p>As rebate checks no higher than $600 arrive at many Americans¹ homes, the

study also found that companies that received millions of dollars in

corporate tax rebates then paid their CEOs more than other firms.



<p>Between 1996 and 1998, 41 large, profitable corporations used special tax

breaks to reduce their corporate tax bill to less than zero, receiving

outright federal tax rebate checks, according to the Institute on Taxation

and Economic Policy. (In contrast, the current rebates are paid only to

people who paid income taxes.) As a group, the CEOs of these firms averaged

pay hikes of 69% in the year of the rebate, far above the typical CEO raise

of 38%. In six cases ­ Black & Decker, Praxair, Coca-Cola,

Colgate-Palmolive, Enron, and McKesson ­ the CEO¹s raise entirely consumed

his company¹s tax rebate for that year.

 

<p>The increased wage inequity in 2000 continued a decade-long trend. If the

minimum wage had grown at the same rate as CEO pay since 1990, 571%, it

would now be $25.50 an hour, rather than $5.15 an hour.



<p><i>The Institute for Policy Studies is an independent center for progressive

research and education in Washington, DC.  United for a Fair Economy is a

national organization based in Boston that spotlights growing economic

inequality.
