- July 20 - The U.S. federal court in Los Angeles rejected pressure from the prosecution to keep the Stop Star Wars 17 international activists in jail and agreed to bail all but one. But Greenpeace is demanding an immediate resolution to the delay in freeing the final defendant, Samir Nazareth. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The court agreed that the bail provisions posted on Monday for all of the non-U.S citizens were acceptable and there was no risk of any of them leaving the country as the prosecution claimed. But they refused to allow Samir Nazareth out on bail, because of prosecution claims that his passport was not valid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is unacceptable that the courts have not cleared Samir's documents. He is a well traveled, highly educated man, and all of his papers are in order,&quot; said Greenpeace International disarmament campaigner William Peden. &quot;The Stop Star Wars 17 have already been discriminated against as a group because of their stand against Star Wars, we now have to question if Samir is being discriminated against as an individual.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pressure is now being brought to bear by Greenpeace and the Indian consulate to ensure the authorities act immediately to resolve the alleged problems. The remaining nine non-U.S citizens are expected to be released on Friday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While we are relieved that the rest of our friends are now out on bail, or will very soon be out, we will not relax until everyone is out and in the same way we will not relax until the Star Wars program is stopped,&quot; Peden added. &quot;Now is the time for Star Wars to be put on trial, not non violent protestors, and we will have our day in court to make our voices and those from around the world, heard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Stop Star Wars 17 face charges in connection with the delay of the Vandenberg missile test last Saturday. Greenpeace is campaigning to stop the Star Wars program because it will lead to a new nuclear arms race.</font></p>
