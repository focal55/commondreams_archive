- April 19 - A ground-breaking new report by Human Rights 

Watch, No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons, charges that state 

authorities are responsible for widespread prisoner-on-prisoner sexual 

abuse in U.S. men's prisons. The 378-page report is based on more than 

three years of research and is the first national survey of 

prisoner-on-prisoner rape. There are some two million inmates in U.S. 

prisons and jails. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rape is in no way an inevitable consequence of incarceration,&quot; said     

                                         Joanne Mariner, deputy director 

of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, and author of the 

report. &quot;But it is a predictable one if prison and prosecutorial 

authorities do little to prevent and punish it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch warned that by failing to implement reasonable        

         measures to prevent and punish rape&#151;and, indeed, in many cases, 

taking actions that make sexual victimization likely&#151;state authorities 

permit this physically and psychologically devastating abuse to occur. 

The                  group's findings are based on correspondence with 

more than 200 prisoners spread among thirty-four states, inmate 

interviews, and a comprehensive survey of state correctional 

authorities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain prisoners are targeted for sexual exploitation the moment they 

enter a penal facility: their age, looks, sexual preference, and other 

characteristics mark them as candidates for abuse. Human Rights Watch's 

research revealed a broad range of factors that correlate with increased 

vulnerability to rape. These include youth, small size, and physical 

weakness; being white, gay, or a first offender; possessing &quot;feminine&quot; 

characteristics such as long hair or a high voice; being unassertive, 

unaggressive, shy, intellectual, not street-smart, or &quot;passive&quot;; or 

having been convicted of a sexual offense against a minor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sexual Slavery

In the most extreme cases, Human Rights Watch found that prisoners 

unable to escape a situation of sexual abuse may find themselves the 

&quot;slaves&quot; of their rapists. Forced to satisfy another man's sexual 

appetites whenever he demands, they may also be responsible for washing 

his clothes, massaging his back, cooking his food, cleaning his cell, 

and a range of other chores. They are frequently &quot;rented out&quot; for sex, 

sold, or even auctioned off to other inmates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No conclusive national data exist regarding the prevalence of 

prisoner-on-prisoner rape in the United States. But the most recent 

statistical survey, published in the Prison Journal, showed that 21 

percent of inmates in seven Midwestern prisons had experienced at least 

one episode of pressured or forced sex since being incarcerated,         

        and at least 7 percent had been raped in their facility. And an 

internal departmental survey of corrections officers in one southern 

state found that line officers &#151; those charged with the direct 

supervision of inmates &#151; estimated that roughly one-fifth of all 

prisoners were being coerced into participation in inmate-on-inmate sex.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These rapes are unimaginably vicious and brutal,&quot; said Mariner. &quot;Gang 

assaults are not uncommon, and victims may be left beaten, bloody and, 

in the most extreme cases, dead.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most tragic and violent cases the report documents is that of 

Randy Payne, a twenty-three-year-old incarcerated in Texas. Within a 

week of entering prison, Payne was attacked by a group of some twenty 

inmates. The inmates demanded sex and money, but Payne refused. He was 

beaten for almost two hours, and died of head injuries a few days later.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Victims of rape often suffer extreme psychological stress, a condition 

identified as &quot;rape trauma syndrome.&quot; Many inmate victims with whom 

Human Rights Watch has been in contact have reported nightmares, deep    

             depression, shame, loss of self-esteem, self-hatred, and 

considering or attempting suicide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Deliberate Indifference&quot;

Correctional authorities generally deny that prisoner-on-prisoner rape 

is a serious problem. Human Rights Watch surveyed correctional 

authorities in all 50 states on the prevalence of rape and sexual abuse. 

In that multi-year survey, not one state reported abuse rates even 

faintly approaching those found by academic researchers. For example, 

New Mexico prison officials said, regarding &quot;the &#145;problem' of male 

inmate-on-inmate rape and sexual abuse&quot; (internal quotation marks are 

theirs), that they had &quot;no recorded incidents over the past few years.&quot; 

Nearly half of all states do not even compile separate statistics on 

sexual assault.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authorities' reluctance to acknowledge the problem of 

prisoner-on-prisoner rape is reflected not only in misleading official 

statistics, but also in a glaringly inadequate response to incidents of 

rape. &quot;U.S. state prisons have failed to take even obvious, basic steps 

necessary to tackle prison rape,&quot; Mariner said. &quot;This deliberate 

indifference has had tragic consequences.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A central problem is the deficient &#151; and, in many instances, callous and 

irresponsible &#151; response of correctional staff to complaints of rape. 

When an inmate informs an officer he has been threatened with rape or, 

worse, actually assaulted, it is crucial that his complaint be 

investigated and that he be protected from further abuse. Yet Human 

Rights Watch found that correctional staff frequently ignore or even 

react hostilely to inmates' complaints of rape.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Another important contributing factor to the prison rape crisis is the 

failure of the criminal justice system to address these crimes,&quot; said 

Mariner. &quot;Perpetrators of prison rape rarely face criminal charges, even 

when rape is accompanied by extreme physical violence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case of M.R., a Texas inmate, is illustrative. M.R. was violently 

raped and beaten several times over a period of several months by the 

same prisoner. Fearful for his life, he reported the abuse to the prison 

authorities, but found no protection. In fact one investigator dismissed 

the problem as a &quot;lovers' quarrel.&quot; Finally one day the rapist showed up 

in M.R.'s housing area and attacked M.R. again. The rapist hit M.R. so 

hard with a combination lock that when M.R. regained consciousness he 

could read the word &quot;Master&quot; &#151; the lockmaker                 &#151; on his 

forehead. In all, during the rape, M.R. suffered a broken neck, jaw, 

left collarbone, and finger; a dislocated left shoulder; two major 

concussions, and lacerations to his scalp that caused bleeding on the 

brain. Notwithstanding the extreme violence of the attack, and despite 

M.R.'s best efforts to press charges, the rapist                 was 

never criminally prosecuted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another devastating consequence of prisoner-on-prisoner rape discussed 

in the report is the transmission of the HIV virus. Several prisoners 

with whom Human Rights Watch is in contact believe that they have 

contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, through forced sexual 

intercourse in prison.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book-length Human Rights Watch report explains:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; why and how prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse occurs; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; who commits it and who falls victim to it;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; prison rape's long-term effects, both physical and psychological;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; how are prison authorities coping with it; and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; what reforms must be instituted to better prevent rape from   

occurring.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Prison rape is part of the mythology of prison life. But in reality, it 

is devastating human rights abuse that can and should be prevented,&quot; 

said Mariner. The report includes extensive recommendations to federal 

and state authorities, urging them to step up their efforts to address 

this gross violation of human dignity. </font></p>
