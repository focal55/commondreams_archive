<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 26 -  Michael D. Barnes, 

President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, today 

issued the following statement regarding recent proposals to 

increase airline security by arming pilots of commercial aircraft: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The terrorist attacks of September 11 have inspired, and 

rightly so, a national debate regarding how best to heighten 

security at U.S. airports and on commercial flights. In this 

difficult time, we understand the intense fears of airline pilots, 

passengers and crew following the horrific hijackings, and we 

support doing everything we can to strengthen aircraft and airport 

security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;However, we do have some serious concerns about recent 

proposals to arm airline pilots. Safety begins with prevention. We 

need to make sure that armed terrorists are not able to board 

aircraft in the first place. In addition to dramatically increasing 

security at the airport (for instance, enhancing cockpit security 

and intensifying passenger and luggage screening), there are 

tangible things we can do to make our 'homeland' safer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These measures include requiring background checks on all gun 

sales to prevent criminals, and would-be terrorists, from obtaining 

guns, and retaining records of gun purchases, so that weapons can 

be traced if they are used in a crime or terrorist act. If we can 

detect terrorists while they are attempting to amass their 

arsenals, we can help to prevent future attacks and take a key step 

forward in the effort to boost the security of all Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the coming weeks and months, we can expect to see many 

proposals geared toward augmenting security on commercial flights. 

These proposals, in particular the question of whether to arm 

pilots, should be considered with great care. There are a number of 

questions that need to be answered before we proceed. Can we ensure 

that a weapon on an airplane will not fall into the wrong hands? 

Could firing the gun in a plane compromise its integrity, causing 

it to crash? When would pilots be authorized to use guns? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration are looking at 

this issue, and we support their desire to study it. At a minimum, 

we need to ensure that anyone armed on a plane meets strict 

qualifications and is trained as a sworn federal law enforcement 

officer. Air marshals are an appropriate response to stopping 

terrorism in the air because they are law enforcement officers who 

are continually trained in firearms safety, appropriate use of 

force, and shoot/don't-shoot scenarios. Trained air marshals would 

have one purpose, which is to monitor the airplane and protect the 

passengers and crew. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Finally, models exist for preventing terrorism on aircraft 

without arming pilots exist. One such example is El Al, the Israeli 

airlines. I have traveled on El Al and was impressed with its 

security program. While we cannot draw exact parallels between the 

El Al and the entire U.S. airline industry, we should closely 

examine all such models and learn from their experience.&quot; </font>
