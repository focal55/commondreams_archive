- March 6 - The following is a

statement by Doug Dority, international president, United Food And

Commercial Workers Union:

<p>The United Food and Commercial Workers Union is the largest

organization of food processing workers in the United States. We

put breakfast, lunch and dinner on the table for America's

families.

<p>To feed America's families, thousands of food processing workers

are needlessly crippled and maimed each year. Meatpacking and

poultry processing have some of the highest incidences of

repetitive motion injuries in the country.

<p>It is easy to understand.

<p>Take a knife and make a forceful cutting motion. Do the exact

same motion again...and, again...and, again...and, again. Make that

exact same motion 10,000 times...20,000 times...40,000 to 50,000

times a day. Do it for five or six days a week...50 weeks a year.

<p>You will find out what happens to your hand, your wrist, your

elbow, your shoulder. You won't be able to pick your child. You

won't be able to play ball with your kids. You won't be able to do

a hundred simple things that most of us take for granted.

<p>I challenge any Senator or Member of Congress who is thinking of

voting against America's workers and voting against the ergonomic

standard -- to take a food processor's knife and make just a few

thousand cuts -- and, see for themselves why the ergonomic standard

is essential to protect working families from injury, pain and job

loss.

<p>I challenge the leadership of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and

the National Association of Manufacturers to take a food

processor's knife and make just a few thousand cuts -- and, then

say there is no need for an ergonomic standard.

<p>I doubt if we will have any takers on this challenge.

<p>The case against the ergonomic standard is based on

ignorance...not information. The case against the ergonomic

standard is based on political muscle...not the human muscle that

produces the food products that feed America.

<p>We know that ergonomics works. We have redesigned work stations

in meatpacking plants...and, we cut the injuries, we cut the worker

compensation costs, and we cut the human misery that comes with

workplace illnesses and injuries.

<p>We know that OSHA enforcement action -- or, the potential of

OSHA enforcement action -- motivates employers to work together

with workers and their unions to put effective ergonomics programs

in place.

<p>The UFCW has some of the most effective ergo programs in the

country -- at IBP in Dakota City, Nebraska and at various Excel

plants.

<p>These plants are models for the meatpacking industry and any

other industry. We know that without OSHA, employers are much less

likely to deal effectively with repetitive motion injuries.

<p>The ergonomic standard is the catalyst for action...action that

will prevent the thousands of crippling injuries that are

destroying life, work and family for workers in the food processing

industry.

<p>The 1.4 million member UFCW represents workers in retail food,

meatpacking, food processing, health care and chemicals. The UFCW

is one of the largest single organizations of workers directly

impacted by an ergonomic standard. The UFCW initiated the effort

for an ergonomic standard during the George Bush Administration.

Bush's Secretary of Labor, Elizabeth Dole, began work on the

ergonomic standard following a meeting with the UFCW President. The

current standard is a direct result of the work of the UFCW more

than a decade ago.
