<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- December 12 - Physicians for Social 

Responsibility (PSR) condemns unequivocally the move by President 

Bush to unilaterally withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile 

(ABM) Treaty. On behalf of more than 20,000 doctors, nurses, public 

health professionals and others, PSR is urging all Senators and 

responsible political leaders to show their support for this vital 

Treaty. The ABM Treaty has been key to the prevention of nuclear 

war, and reductions in nuclear arms for 30 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, PSR presents 20,000 signed letters from PSR members and 

supporters to the Senate and to President Bush opposing withdrawal 

from the ABM Treaty. The letters also call on the President not to 

destroy a treaty that has helped keep us all secure, and not to 

deploy an unproven system at a cost of hundreds of billions of 

dollars we haven't got in our deficit and recession-plagued 

economy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A unilateral move to abandon this key Treaty will endanger 

Americans and reduce American security,&quot; said Robert K. Musil, 

Ph.D., MPH, executive director and CEO of Physicians for Social 

Responsibility. &quot;This maneuver will destabilize relations with 

Russia at a time when we most need their help in the fight to 

prevent Russian nuclear materials or weapons falling into the hands 

of terrorists. This is a real threat the President should be 

working with Russia to eliminate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR is also faxing Senators urging them to speak out on the risk 

the President is taking with our national security. &quot;This move 

threatens all the arms reductions achieved to date. Russia has said 

with U.S. National Missile Defense in place, it will aim new, more 

sophisticated weapons at the United States, even as the Russian 

early warning system fails. Such a development makes an accidental 

nuclear launch a more likely and more deadly threat. Deployment of 

NMD will likely spark a Chinese arms buildup, in numbers of 

warheads and in sophistication of delivery methods,&quot; said Martin 

Butcher, director of security programs for PSR. &quot;This could cause 

a further arms race between India and Pakistan. The President is 

endangering America, making nuclear war more likely here or in 

regional conflicts.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The increased nuclear threat that will result from the 

President's own policies will be used to justify the deployment of 

NMD,&quot; said Butcher. &quot;The President is raising the threat of nuclear 

proliferation, and thus of a catastrophic nuclear conflict and then 

saying the world is a dangerous place so we need missile defense. 

This is truly politics through the looking glass.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its appeal to Senators, PSR says: &quot;President Bush is moving 

ahead with a highly questionable and controversial policy at a time 

when he should be building unity in a nation at war. As a Senator, 

you have a duty to your constituents and to the nation to hold the 

President to account. Please speak out for the preservation not 

just of the ABM treaty, but of all arms control and 

non-proliferation measures. Oppose the President's plan -- tell him 

to stop and think before it is too late.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., MPH, executive director and CEO of PSR 

is available for interview. </font></p>
