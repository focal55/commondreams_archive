- February 6 -  Once again, the National Rifle Association has demonstrated

its hypocrisy when it comes to supporting law enforcement. On

January 8, the New York Times profiled a successful gun lock

giveaway program in Maine. The program is sponsored by the

Maine Citizens Against Handgun Violence Foundation, a nonprofit

organization dedicated to research, education and awareness of

gun violence and gun safety issues in the state. The Foundation

purchases gun locks with private funds and distributes them free

of charge via local police agencies.

<p>On January 27, the Associated Press reported that the

National Rifle Association opposes the Maine gun lock giveaway

program.

<p>THE HYPOCRISY:

<p>In the AP article, NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam is quoted

as saying that his organization is "not happy that law

enforcement officers who are paid with public money, with

taxpayers' money, are involved. They should not be working so

closely to an advocacy group."

<p>Yet the NRA supports Project HomeSafe, a gun lock giveaway

program run by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF),

a gun industry trade group closely aligned with the NRA. Like

the Maine program, Project HomeSafe relies on police

participation to distribute its locks. According to the

program's website, police involvement in the giveaway is

"critical to the success of the program" and "(p)olice

departments will manage the distribution of the gun locking

devices..." In June 2000, the NRA promoted the Project HomeSafe

program in a fax alert to its members.

<p>"The NRA's criticism of the Maine gun lock giveaway program

is the height of hypocrisy," said Handgun Control President

Michael Barnes. "The NRA criticizes the Maine gun lock giveaway

program, yet it actively promotes an almost identical program

sponsored by the gun industry. Obviously, the NRA objects to

the Maine program because the Maine Citizens Against Handgun

Violence Foundation's sister organization, Maine Citizens

Against Handgun Violence, supports common-sense gun laws. Like

a petulant child, the NRA only opposes a statewide gun lock

giveaway program that is successful without -- and despite --

its participation and approval."

<p>THE HUBRIS:

<p>The Associated Press article also reports:

<p>The NRA said it would have been more likely to support the

(Maine) program if it had been consulted before it began.

<p>"As the national expert on gun safety, we should have been

contacted," Arulanandam said.

<p>"Clearly, the NRA feels that law enforcement officials aren't

qualified to judge the merit of a gun lock giveaway program on

their own," said Barnes. "And the NRA calling itself 'the

national expert on gun safety' is so absurd, it's laughable.

This is an organization that believes children can be left

unattended with guns so long as they're told not to touch them.

This is an organization that promotes the absurd notion that the

more people we have walking our streets carrying hidden

handguns, the safer our society will be."

<p>THE IRONY:

<p>In October 2000, the gun industry had to suspend its Project

HomeSafe program after police departments in Tennessee found

that the program's locks were faulty and could easily be

defeated. The NSSF had to issue warnings to police departments

across the country that had received hundreds of thousands of

these defective locks for distribution. In January 2001, the

NSSF informed Project HomeSafe participants that it would be

working with the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to

replace the locks.

<p>"Given the fact that guns are exempt from the CPSC's

oversight and that the gun industry resists any attempts to

implement standards for its products," said Barnes, "I find it

ironic that the gun industry is working with the CPSC to replace

the faulty locks it distributed. We support the use of child

safety locks, but if gun manufacturers were truly concerned

about safety, they would be doing more than just giving away gun

locks. They should be putting integrated locks and other safety

devices on their products to make them childproof. They should

be working with the CPSC and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and

Firearms to institute industry-wide standards for firearms. If

the NRA and the gun industry really cared about reducing guns

deaths and injuries, they should be supporting legislation to

keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, rather

working against it.

<p>"The NRA's attitude toward the Maine gun lock giveaway is

disgraceful. It is an insult to the Maine Citizens Against

Handgun Violence Foundation, to the gun owners who are taking

advantage of the gun locks and to members of the Maine law

enforcement community who wholeheartedly support this program."

<p><i>Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974

by Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. "Pete" Shields, two victims of gun

violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law

enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups

across the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and

local gun control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI

has over 500,000 members and supporters nationwide, making it

the nation's largest citizens' gun control lobbying

organization. More information about HCI and its sister

organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be

found on our website at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">http://www.handguncontrol.org</a>.
