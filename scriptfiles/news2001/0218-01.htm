- February 18 - Representatives of more than 60 peace-and-justice groups from 

around the United States have formed a new group to resist U.S. policy on 

Iraq -- the National Network to End the War against Iraq.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 150 participants in the 2nd National Conference on Iraq gathered Feb. 

16-17 in Denver to coordinate grassroots efforts to resist not only the 

bombings but also the 10 years of economic sanctions that have killed at 

least 1 million Iraqis, according to United Nations studies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There are activists all around the country who have been resisting U.S. 

aggression against Iraq for years, and this network signals a new level of 

effort and commitment,&quot; said Paul George, a member of the network's newly 

elected Coordinating Committee. &quot;The latest bombings by the Bush 

administration only hint at the enormity of an ongoing political and 

humanitarian disaster.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The network voted unanimously to sponsor &quot;National Days of Outrage&quot; on 

April 26-28, during which groups around the country will coordinate actions 

to highlight the suffering of the Iraqi people at the hands of U.S. policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;U.S. policy toward Iraq is illegal and immoral,&quot; said George. &quot;The only 

people suffering are ordinary Iraqis, especially the children and the sick.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with the public actions, other committees set up at the conference 

will work on public education, outreach and lobbying.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opposition to the crippling sanctions on Iraq has grown around the world in 

the past year, as the evidence of the effects of the embargo on the 

civilian population has moved governments and activist groups to resist 

U.S. policy. Even traditional allies, such as Egypt and Turkey, condemned 

the Feb. 16 bombing, signaling an increasing isolation of the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The no-fly zones are not authorized by any international body, which makes 

the U.S. attack blatantly illegal, and several former high-ranking U.N. 

officials have stated the sanctions violate the letter and the spirit of 

the U.N. Charter,&quot; said George. &quot;For the sake of the Iraqi people, it is 

time for the American people to act.&quot;
