<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - October 5 - Three Nobel laureates will be among the speakers pleading for peace at a 

Manhattan rally and march Sunday afternoon, October 7. Rigoberta Mench&uacute; 

Tum, Adolfo P&eacute;rez Esquivel, and Mairead Maguire will be at the rally 

bearing an anti-war message from 15 additional Peace Prize winners.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a printed statement, the Nobel laureates expressed profound sympathy for 

the victims of the September 11 tragedy and urged, &#147;The response of the 

United States and its allies should not be driven by a blind desire for 

vengeance, but rather the renewed determination to work for a peaceful and 

just world.&#148; They went on to cite concerns about the &#147;downward spiral of 

violence&#148; and &#147;false expectations about the ability of military power to 

solve problems.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Echoing the Nobelists&#146; concerns, Melissa Jameson of the War Resisters 

League said, &#147;Retaliation is the problem, not the solution.&#148; The War 

Resisters League is a 78-year old national pacifist organization that 

helped form the coalition holding the event.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;From the beginning of this crisis, we felt that the people of New York 

City have a particular responsibility to call for a non-military response 

to the events of September 11,&#148; added Carmen Trotta, also with the League. 

&#147;We live in the city that suffered the greatest loss of life and 

devastation. We have seen the destruction caused by a military attack and 

we do not want any other people to endure that suffering in our name.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally and march will begin at 3:00 p.m. at Union Square and proceed 

north to Times Square, ending in a candlelight vigil at sunset. As the sun 

sets across the United States, other communities will follow New York&#146;s 

lead at similar events, with candles greeting the darkness in a nationwide 

message of peace. Local actions have been planned across the country in 

locations as diverse as Coos County, OR, West Palm Beach, FL, and Hudson, 

NY. Peace activists in Philadelphia will march down Broad Street; in 

Chicago, activists plan a candlelight vigil at Buckingham Fountain; in 

Washington, members of Pax Christi will hold an interfaith service.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Working with other peace and social justice organizations through the 

National Coalition for Peace and Justice, an anti-war grouping formed 

during the 1999 war in Yugoslavia, the War Resisters League both helped 

plan the New York City event and encouraged local groups to hold their own 

peace events on October 7. The War Resisters League&#146;s website, 

www.warresisters.org, has become a resource for anti-war activists around 

the world, including a list of local anti-war actions across the country 

and downloadable statements and flyers. Since September 11, the site has 

received thousands of visitors each day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The oldest secular pacifist organization in the country, the War Resisters 

League released a statement within hours of the September 11 attacks 

despite email and telephone problems caused by the World Trade Center 

blast. It called for government officials to cease targeting civilians and 

said, in part, &#147;We are one world. We shall live in a state of fear and 

terror or we shall move toward a future in which we seek peaceful 

alternatives to violence, and a more just distribution of the world&#146;s 

resources. As we mourn the many lives lost, our hearts call out for 

reconciliation, not revenge.&#148;</font></p>
