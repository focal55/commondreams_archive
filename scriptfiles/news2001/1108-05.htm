- November 8 - Senate Republicans are 

holding press conferences today to push a strategy leaked earlier 

this week to demand fast-track approval of Bush administration 

judicial nominees, and to argue that such action is purportedly 

crucial to the war on terrorism. If this afternoon's press 

conferences follow the script reported Monday, senators will claim, 

with White House approval, that not rushing approval of President 

Bush's judicial nominees would somehow prevent law enforcement 

officials from getting wiretaps and search warrants essential to 

identifying terrorists. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People For the American Way Foundation President Ralph G. Neas 

today said that such a plan, if true, was &quot;dishonest and 

disgraceful.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas said search warrants and wiretaps go before magistrates or 

federal district court judges, and noted that the administration 

has submitted nominees for less than one-third of the current 

district court vacancies. As of Nov. 7, there were 70 district 

court vacancies and the administration had submitted only 23 

nominations for those spots. Five district court vacancies in New 

York and New Jersey are included among the 47 with no nominees. 

&quot;If there's a problem with getting district court judges in place 

to assist law enforcement officials, that problem is not in the 

Senate,&quot; said Neas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Senate Republican leaders should be ashamed to distort the 

truth and misuse the national commitment to fighting terrorism in 

this blatant fashion,&quot; said Neas. &quot;The right wing's number one goal 

for this administration is to pack the federal judiciary with far 

right ideologues. They are now trying to use the war on terrorism 

to promote that agenda.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas said some senators have already said that supporting the 

war on terrorism requires a rubber stamp approach to Bush 

administration judicial nominees, and have claimed that Senate 

Democrats have unfairly delayed consideration of his nominees. Both 

claims are false, Neas said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recent PFAW Foundation report debunked GOP complaints about 

the current confirmation process; indeed, confirmations have 

outpaced the first year of the first Bush administration in 1989 

and by the end of the year will likely be comparable to 1993, the 

first year of the Clinton administration. In fact, as of 

yesterday, the Senate had confirmed 16 of President Bush's judicial 

nominees, more than the 15 confirmed in the entire first year of 

the first Bush administration. With respect to the district 

courts, President Bush has nominated 35 judges, and 12 of those 

have already been confirmed. Of the 23 remaining nominees, nine 

have already had confirmation hearings. This is in spite of the 

fact that 13 of these nominations were not even made until 

September or later. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that the Bush administration's apparent priority for 

judicial nominees has been to the federal appeals courts. The same 

far-right senators who led an unprecedented blockade against 

Clinton's appeals court nominees -- stopping nearly half of 

Clinton's appeals court nominees between 1995 and 2000 -- are now 

calling for immediate action on Bush nominees while complaining 

that Bush's nominees have received unfair treatment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAWF's recent report noted that by the end of this 

administration, every one of the 13 circuit courts of appeal could 

be dominated by Republican nominees. If those nominees are 

predominantly right-wing ideologues, the consequences for 

Americans' constitutional rights and civil liberties could be 

disastrous and long lasting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today Neas reiterated his call for President Bush to engage in 

genuine bipartisan consultation in an unprecedented solution to 

this unprecedented situation with the courts. He also said, &quot;The 

Senate must resist the politics of intimidation, carry out its 

constitutional obligation to carefully consider the nominations 

that come before it, and reject candidates whose record does not 

reflect a commitment to constitutional rights.&quot; </font></p>
