- March 6 -  Miles Rapoport, former

Connecticut Secretary of the State and a leading authority on

democracy reform issues, has been selected as the President of Demos:

A Network for Ideas and Action. Rapoport assumed leadership of Demos

on Feb. 15.

<p>Demos is a non-partisan organization based in New York City.

Founded in 1999, it seeks to strengthen U.S. democracy and broaden

economic opportunity. It represents a national effort to develop bold

new ideas for social change, as well as stronger alliances among

civic and economic reformers. Demos' start-up has been made possible

by nearly $4 million in funding by major foundations, including the

Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Nathan Cummings Foundation,

Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and Carnegie Corporation.

<p>Currently, Demos is playing a major role in democracy reform

efforts following the 2000 election and is conducting a comprehensive

study of the health of democracy in the 50 states. The study, to be

released next spring, will be the most comprehensive examination of

U.S. democratic institutions and processes undertaken since the 2000

election.

<p>Rapoport served for ten years in the Connecticut legislature

before being elected Secretary of the State in 1994. As a state

legislator, he was a leading expert on electoral reform, chairing the

Committee on Elections. As Secretary of the State, Rapoport released

two unique reports on the state of democracy in Connecticut. His

articles have appeared in national magazines and newspapers, and he

is the founder of Northeast Action, a leading political reform

organization in New England. Rapoport is moving to Demos from his

position as Executive Director of DemocracyWorks, a Hartford-based

democracy reform organization he founded in 1999.

<p>Demos' founding President, Stephen Heintz, was recently named

President of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Heintz said he was

delighted at Rapoport's selection. "Miles Rapoport was the ideal

selection for the Presidency of Demos. He has demonstrated a broad

vision and a deep commitment to expanding democratic participation

and achieving social and economic justice through 25 years of

advocacy and public service. He has become a national leader in the

crucial and expanding movement to improve the way our democracy is

conducted. Demos can play a pivotal role in the development of this

movement, and Miles' experience and commitment can help Demos fulfill

its promise."

<p>Charles Halpern, who chairs the Board of Demos and played a lead

role in its founding, added: "Miles Rapoport is well known and highly

regarded in public policy circles, in the advocacy community, and in

the philanthropic community. Demos is at an exciting point in its

development, moving from a successful start-up to a major national

institution, contributing fresh ideas and new energy on important

issues. Miles' experience in founding and leading successful

non-profit organizations, and his record of seeing new issues and

advancing them in the public debate, will be a great asset to Demos

in the years ahead."

<p>Rapoport said: "I am honored and challenged to assume the

leadership of Demos. In the months since the election of 2000, the

need for a national center that can focus and strengthen efforts to

enhance our democracy has become urgent. It is also critical to link

those issues to the larger problems of economic fairness and quality

of life in America with new ideas and energetic networking and

action. The opportunity to work on these issues at the national

level is tremendously exciting. Demos has done important work

already in a short time, and has built a solid platform for a future

national leadership role. I intend to advance these efforts as its

President."

<p>Members of Demos' Board of Trustees include: former U.S.

Congressmen David Skaggs and Tom Campbell, Linda Tarr-Whelan, former

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on the Status of

Women, Vanessa Kirsch, a leading social entrepreneur, and former

Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich.
