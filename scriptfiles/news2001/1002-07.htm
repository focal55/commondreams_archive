<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHILADELPHIA - October 2 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) encourages organizations committed to nonviolence and social and economic justice to join National Days of Peace on the 7th of October, November and December. National Days of Peace are part of AFSC's No More Victims campaign, which seeks peaceful solutions in aftermath of the September 11 tragedies. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept centers around the following points of unity: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. We mourn the victims and condemn the attacks of September 11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. We stand in defense of civil liberties. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. We oppose anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and all forms of racial, ethnic, and religious violence and bigotry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. We oppose military intervention and war. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. We seek global peace through social and economic justice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. We support justice not vengeance; bring the perpetrators to justice through established principles of international law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We encourage like-minded groups and supporters of peace throughout the U.S and the world to organize candlelight vigils, marches and other gatherings and join our call for peace and justice - not war, revenge or retaliation,&quot; states Judith McDaniel, director of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) Peace Building Unit. &quot;Let there be no more victims, either in the U.S. or abroad.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 7, events include a call for Justice - Not War. In addition, National Days of Peace will underscore Upholding Civil Liberties and Redefining the Meaning of Security in future months. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The world is forever changed by the tragic events of September 11,&quot; McDaniel continues. &quot;The loss of life, the sadness and the families destroyed by these horrible acts will be with all of us for many years to come.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, McDaniel reminds us that our grief is not a cry for war. The very principles on which this country was founded do not support the erosion of civil liberties or the condemnation and discrimination of entire groups of people for individual acts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simultaneous vigils will be held in cities throughout the United States, including New York, Chicago and Washington, DC. In addition, people seeking ways to respond peacefully to the events of September 11 may sign on to the AFSC No More Victims national advertising campaign at <a href="http://www.afsc.org/nomore/ad.htm" target="_new">www.afsc.org/nomore/ad.htm</a> </font></p>
