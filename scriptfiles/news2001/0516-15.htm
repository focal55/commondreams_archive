- May 16 - With President Bush announcing proposals for a national

energy policy today, the following analysts are available for interviews:

<P><LI>MINDY SPATT, <A HREF="mailto:turn@turn.org">turn@turn.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.turn.org">www.turn.org</A><BR>

Media director of TURN, The Utility Reform Network, Spatt

said today: "Many outside California don't understand why deregulation has

failed. The generators (like Reliant, Dynegy, Mirant) and traders (like Enron

and Williams), which control our electric supply, are manipulating and gaming the

market in order to extract obscene profits. Last week, a megawatt, which costs

less than $150 to produce, was being sold for $1,900. Several state agencies

are investigating market abuse, including allegations that plants have been

taken off line unnecessarily in order to drive prices up. Our primary problem

is not a lack of supply, it's an excess of greed."

<LI>ALAN NOGEE, <a href="mailto:anogee@ucsusa.org">anogee@ucsusa.org</a><A href="http://www.ucsusa.org/">, www.ucsusa.org</A><BR>

Director of the Union of Concerned Scientists Clean Energy

Program, Nogee said today: "The administration claims that renewable

energy technologies are years away and can only contribute a minor amount to

our energy supply. In fact, wind and solar are the fastest-growing energy

sources in the world. One thousand megawatts of wind energy were added last

year across 13 states. The five national energy laboratories have produced a

study showing that non-hydro renewable energy could grow to supply 7.5 percent

of U.S. electricity by 2010. Our studies show that this could continue to at

least 20 percent by 2020."

<P><LI>DANIELLE BRIAN, <A HREF="beth@pogo.org">beth@pogo.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.pogo.org">www.pogo.org</A><BR>

Executive director of the Project On Government Oversight,

Brian said today: "There is litigation suggesting that oil and gas

companies are short-changing their payments for taking gas from public lands.

It's been reported that one case may result in $10 billion in gas royalty

settlements."

<P><LI>SHEILA KRUMHOLZ, <A HREF="mailto:skrumholz@crp.org">skrumholz@crp.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.opensecrets.org">www.opensecrets.org</A><BR>

Research director of the Center for Responsive Politics,

Krumholz said today: "Three quarters of all energy donations go to

Republicans; the big jump came when Republicans took over Congress following

the 1994 elections. In the last cycle, the energy sector donated $64.6 million;

nearly half came from soft money. More than half came from the oil and gas

industry. While the energy sector was not one of the largest contributors to

Bush, he was the top recipient in all of the major industries within energy.

Enron was the top donor from the energy sector. Although energy can't hold a

candle to the money that the finance sector can deliver, many of the leaders in

the energy industry served as rainmakers for the Bush campaign, enlisting other

big donors."
