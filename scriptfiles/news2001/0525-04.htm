- May 25 - The following policy analysts are available for interviews about 

implications of the Senate shakeup:



</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LARRY AGRAN

Agran is the mayor of Irvine, California. He said today: "It's unwise to 

expect too much from the national Democratic Party. Instead of organizing 

nationwide against Bush's outrageous $1.6 trillion tax-cut bonanza for the 

rich, the Democrats folded like a tent and agreed to a $1.35 trillion tax 

giveaway. With Jeffords' switch and the Democrats in control of the Senate, 

we'll soon see if the Democratic Party actually is prepared to do something 

about campaign finance reform, prescription drug benefits for seniors and 

the national scandal of persistent child poverty in America."

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CLARENCE LUSANE, <a href="mailto:clusane@american.edu">clusane@american.edu</a>

<br>

Professor of political science at the School of International Service at 

American University, Lusane said today: "Jeffords has been a moderate 

Republican, so he's going to line up with the moderate, not the liberal, 

Democrats. There will be limits on how much it changes the politics of the 

Senate, but it will change in a flash who is in control of the Senate. This 

will have an effect on judicial appointments, budget issues, foreign 

policy. Jesse Helms is no longer chair of the Foreign Relations Committee."

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JACQUELINE CABASSO, <a href="mailto:wslf@earthlink.net">wslf@earthlink.net</a>, <a href="http://www.wslfweb.org">http://www.wslfweb.org</a>

<br>

Cabasso, executive director of Western States Legal Foundation, said today: 

"The new Democratic leadership should mobilize support for the ABM Treaty 

and take action to oppose dangerous and destabilizing missile defense 

schemes. They should reinvigorate support for the Kyoto protocol, the 

Biological Weapons Convention and a sustainable energy policy. And they 

should aggressively challenge plans to develop 'mini-nukes,' proposals for 

oil drilling in the Alaskan wilderness and the renewed drive for nuclear 

power."

<br>

National coordinator of the Independent Progressive Politics Network, Glick 

said today: "While this might slow down parts of the Republican offensive, 

it's inevitable that we will see a continuation, by and large, of the same 

types of policies that we have had since the Reagan Revolution, whether 

under Reagan, Bush, Clinton and now Bush II.... A high military budget was 

continued despite the end of the Cold War... More people were incarcerated 

under Clinton than under any other administration in U.S. history..."

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WILLIAM GROVER, <a href="mailto:wgrover@smcvt.edu">wgrover@smcvt.edu</a>

<br>

Professor and chair of the political science department at St. Michael's 

College in Vermont and author of "The President As Prisoner," Grover said 

today: "Certainly, having Democrats in control of certain key Senate 

committees -- Labor, Environment, Judiciary -- will help smooth the more 

draconian edges of right-wing Republican policies in these areas in the 

short term. Government policy possibly may be marginally less destructive. 

But let's not take leave of our senses. The Democrats have been partners 

with the GOP in dismantling the welfare state, remilitarizing our economy, 

and foisting anti-democratic trade policy (NAFTA, WTO) on the American 

public and, indeed, the world..."
