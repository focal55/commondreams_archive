- February 14 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force today commended U.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler for reintroducing the Permanent Partners Immigration Act and urged Congress to move swiftly on the legislation. The bill would allow United States citizens and lawful permanent residents to sponsor their permanent partners for residence in the United States. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender families need the same level of government recognition and support as any other family,&quot; said NGLTF Executive Director Elizabeth Toledo. &quot;This bill will unite families and amend laws that have torn apart caring, committed couples across borders. We urge Congress to honor these human commitments by passing this bill as soon as possible.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. immigration is largely based on the principle of family unification, which allows U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor their spouses and other family members for immigration purposes. Current U.S. laws are based upon a restrictive definition of family, which does not include same-sex partners of U.S. citizens and permanent residents in family-based immigration. Because of this inhumane policy, thousands of lesbian and gay binational couples are kept apart, torn apart or forced to live with the foreign partner undocumented and in constant fear of deportation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nadler, D-NY, sponsored similar legislation last year, but the conservative-controlled Congress failed to bring it up for a vote. The bill would add &quot;permanent partners&quot; after references to &quot;spouses&quot; in the Immigration and Nationality Act. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirteen countries currently recognize gay and lesbian couples for immigration purposes, including such allies as Canada and Australia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. </i></font></p>
