- December 6 - Attorney General John 

Ashcroft's Justice Department has decreed that the war on terror 

ends where the gun lobby's interests begin, the Violence Policy 

Center (VPC) stated today. The VPC's charge comes in the wake of 

the admission today by the Justice Department that it has reversed 

prior policy and banned law enforcement from checking the Federal 

Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) National Instant Criminal 

Background Check System (NICS) audit log to determine if potential 

terrorists have sought to purchase firearms. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Confirmation of this policy comes just one week after a VPC 

report, &quot;Firearms Training for Jihad in America,&quot; revealed the 

contents of a Jihad training manual which urged Muslim holy 

warriors to exploit lax firearms laws in the United States to 

obtain military-style firearms and weapons training. The manual 

was located on an Internet jihad web site and was reportedly found 

in terrorist safehouses in Kabul, Afghanistan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Attorney General Ashcroft has reversed established Justice 

Department policy, placing the paranoid views of the gun lobby over 

the safety and security of all Americans,&quot; states VPC Litigation 

Director and Legislative Counsel Mathew Nosanchuk. Prior to 

joining the VPC this year, Nosanchuk-an expert on the NICS-served 

in the Clinton Justice Department, drafting many of the regulations 

regarding use of the NICS. Ashcroft was featured on the cover of 

the July 2001 issue of the National Rifle Association magazine 

America's 1st Freedom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adds Nosanchuk, &quot;The Ashcroft Justice Department wants to do 

everything to potential terrorists except disarm them. They have 

been a bull in a china shop when it comes to civil liberties, 

stretching their authority past the breaking point: detaining 

suspects and witnesses, permitting eavesdropping on detainees' 

conversations with attorneys, and authorizing military tribunals. 

But the Ashcroft Justice Department walks on eggshells when it 

comes to the special interests of the gun lobby, reading 

non-existent prohibitions into the law and tying the hands of law 

enforcement.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On September 20, 2001 President Bush promised that, &quot;We will 

direct every resource at our command-every means of diplomacy, 

every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, 

every financial influence and every necessary weapon of war-to the 

disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.&quot; 

Attorney General Ashcroft's actions fly in the face of this 

promise. </font></p>
