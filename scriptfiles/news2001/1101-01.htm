<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK 

- November 1 - During the weeks following September's terrorist attacks, two leading

dailies used their op-ed pages as an echo chamber for the government's

official policy of military response, mostly ignoring dissenters and policy

critics.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A FAIR survey of the New York Times and the Washington Post op-ed pages for

the three weeks following the attacks (9/12/01 - 10/2/01) found that columns

calling for or assuming a military response to the attacks were given a

great deal of space, while opinions urging diplomatic and international law

approaches as an alternative to military action were nearly non-existent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We counted a total of 44 columns in the Times and Post that clearly stressed

a military response, against only two columns stressing non-military

solutions. (Though virtually every op-ed in both papers dealt in some way

with September 11, most did not deal specifically with how to respond to the

attacks, with many focusing on economics, rebuilding, New York's Rudolph

Giuliani, etc. During the period surveyed, the Post ran a total of 105 op-ed

columns, the Times ran 79.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, the Post was more militaristic, running at least 32 columns urging

military action, compared to 12 in the Times. But the Post also provided the

only two columns we could find in the first three weeks after September 11

that argued for non-military responses; the Times had no such columns. Both

dissenting columns were written by guest writers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Times' and Post's in-house columnists provided the bulk of the pro-war

commentary. Two-thirds of the Times columns urging military action were

written in-house, as were more than half of the Post's pro-war columns. This

may say something about which journalists are singled out for promotion to

the prestigious position of columnist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, both op-ed pages showed a striking gender imbalance. Of the 107

op-ed writers at the Post, only seven were women. Proportionally, the Times

did slightly better, with eight female writers out of 79.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When critics argue that U.S. news media have a duty to provide a broad

debate on war, a common response is to ask why-- after all, isn't there a

political and popular consensus in favor of war? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps, but there's reason to believe that the extent and nature of that

consensus has been overstated and distorted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In polls that offered a choice between a military response or nothing, it's

true that overwhelming majorities chose war. But given the choice between a

either military assault or pressing for the extradition and trial of those

responsible (Christian Science Monitor, 9/27/01), a substantial minority

either chose extradition (30 percent) or were undecided (16 percent). These

people had next to no representation in the op-ed debate; in fact, it's

likely that many people asked to choose whether or not to go to war had

never seen an alternative to war articulated in a mainstream outlet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is also a little-acknowledged gender gap in poll responses about

military action, a fact that lends new significance to the gender imbalance

in Washington Post and New York Times op-eds. In the final two paragraphs of

a 1,395-word story titled &quot;Public Unyielding in War Against Terror &quot;

(9/29/01), the Washington Post pointed out that women &quot;were significantly

less likely to support a long and costly war.&quot; According to the Post, while

44 percent of women would support a broad military effort, &quot;48 percent said

they want a limited strike or no military action at all.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll (Gallup.com, 10/5/01) showed that 64

percent of men think the U.S. &quot;should mount a long-term war,&quot; while 24

percent favored limiting retaliation to punishing the specific groups

responsible for the attacks. In contrast, &quot;women are evenly divided-- with

42 percent favoring each option.&quot; Noting that &quot;women's support for war is

much more conditional than that of men,&quot; Gallup reports that though 88

percent of women favored taking retaliatory military action, that number

dropped to 55 percent if 1,000 American troops would be killed (76 percent

of men would support a war under these circumstances).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course, gender equity on the op-ed pages would not guarantee proportional

representation for dissenters-- some of the most virulently pro-war and

anti-Muslim columns have been written by female commentators (e.g., Mona

Charen, who called for mass expulsions based on ethnicity--Washington Times,

10/18/01). But given the gender differences suggested by polling, more women

on the op-ed pages might well give the lie to the conventional wisdom that

all Americans have no-holds-barred enthusiasm for an open-ended war.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even, however, if one accepts the idea that the public overwhelmingly favors

war, the task of journalism is to remain independent and to ask tough

questions of policy makers. After all, American history includes many

official policies that were popular in their time, but which today are

viewed as disasters. Wouldn't the country have been better off if

journalists had provided a stronger, more abiding challenge to the consensus

that supported Vietnam, or the internment of Japanese-Americans?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than any other newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post--

with their unmatched influence in the nation's capitol and in U.S.

newsrooms-- have a duty to provide readers with a wide range of views on how

to deal with terrorism, its causes and solutions. If the purpose of the

op-ed page is to provide a vigorous debate including critical opinions, both

papers failed their readers at a crucial time.  </font></p>
