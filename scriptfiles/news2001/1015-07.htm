- October 15 - Clinics around the 

country today reported receiving letters claiming to contain 

anthrax, according to the National Abortion Federation. &quot;We have 

received more than thirty calls so far from member clinics in 

twelve states, and are receiving more calls by the minute,&quot; said 

Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion 

Federation (NAF). &quot;We advised our clinics last week to be on alert 

for this type of attack, based on what was happening in Florida and 

New York. At this point, we do not know if the letters are linked 

to those attacks. We do know that some of the letters reference the 

Army of God, a group of domestic terrorists that has claimed 

responsibility for the murder of abortion providers.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Abortion Federation notified its members through 

fax and e-mail last week that there was an increased risk of an 

anthrax attack. An alert also went out to members today with 

information about the letters that have been received so far. The 

letters claim to contain anthrax, and are filled with a white, 

powdery substance. Some of the letters are postmarked from Atlanta, 

and have a return address &quot;U.S. Secret Service.&quot; Other letters are 

postmarked from Cleveland or Columbus, Ohio, with a &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; 

return address. All clinics are being advised not to open any 

similar or suspicious letters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This type of threat is unfortunately not new to abortion 

providers,&quot; said Saporta. &quot;Those who are opposed to a woman's right 

to choose have not hesitated to resort to bioterrorist threats and 

attacks to advance their personal agenda. Today's events are a sad 

reminder to all Americans that not only do we face threats from 

foreign terrorists, but we also face threats from domestic 

terrorists as well. Until those responsible for these latest 

threats are brought to justice, our members will continue to remain 

vigilant as they provide vital reproductive health care services to 

women.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to anthrax threats received at more than eighty 

clinics from late 1998 to 2000, NAF developed a brochure, &quot;Anthrax: 

Bioterrorism Against Reproductive Health Care Clinics.&quot; The brochure 

has been distributed to abortion providers around the country, as 

well as to law enforcement officials, including the ATF and FBI. </font></p>
