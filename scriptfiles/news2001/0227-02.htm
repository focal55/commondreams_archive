- February 27 - Leaders of the National

Council of Women's Organizations (NCWO) are available for comment on

President George W. Bush's budget proposal and its impact on women

and families. NCWO is the nation's largest coalition of women's

organizations, representing more than 120 groups nationwide, and a

combined membership of over six million women.

<p>"President Bush's budget and tax cut proposal breaks his campaign

pledge to protect and strengthen Social Security. Bush says he wants

to give younger Americans more choice but most workers will face cuts

in guaranteed benefits that are not made up by income from individual

accounts," according to Heidi Hartmann, Ph.D., president of the

Institute for Women's Policy Research and chair of the NCWO Women and

Social Security Project. "If Bush keeps his promises to current

retirees, younger workers will get less when they retire."

<p>"The majority of the more than 100 organizations in NCWO are

extremely concerned about Social Security privatization," adds Martha

Burk, Ph.D., chair of NCWO. "Privatization will destroy the

guarantee that Social Security provides. Gambling on Wall Street

with the only retirement program the majority of older women have is

simply unacceptable."
