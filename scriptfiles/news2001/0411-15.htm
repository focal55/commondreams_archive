- April 11 -  Norway’s Seafood Export Council got the point today when Greenpeace protesters erected a life-sized  harpooned whale tail in front of its headquarters at Flagship Wharf in Charlestown, Mass. Greenpeace was protesting Norway’s plans to export whale meat. The protesters delivered a letter to the members of the Export Council, demanding that they publicly disclose whether the same companies that will be exporting whale products also sell seafood to the United  States.

<p>

“Norway already kills over 500 whales each year,” said  Andrianna Natsoulas, a Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner who was present at the protest. “If Norway is successful in its attempts to export whale products, it will jump-start much larger and more devastating hunts.” 

<p>

Norway’s $939 million seafood export industry could be severely damaged by the country’s plans to export whale products. U.S. consumers alone purchase over $150 million of Norway’s fish annually. 

<p>

“Seven Norwegian seafood companies have applied for export licenses,” continued Natsoulas. “If we determine that those same companies export seafood to the United States we are going to let people know. The American public would be shocked to learn that the fish they eat is caught by companies that conduct whale hunts.”  

<p>

In recent months, several environmental groups have taken measures to thwart Norway’s plans. On March 23 a coalition of over 20 organizations from around the world sent a letter warning Norway’s Export Council that resuming trade in whale meat and blubber would be  “ill-considered and unacceptable.” The following week, Greenpeace ran an ad in the Boston Globe, urging consumers to “Stop Norway’s plans to export whale products.” The ad coincided with a cyberaction that allows people to send faxes and e-mails to the Export Council. Thousands of people have already participated in the online action.
