- October 19 - Memo To Reporters Covering The Environment </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We were intrigued at the news release issued late yesterday by 

the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regarding air quality 

trends in the nation (see <a href="http://www.epa.gov" target="_new">http://www.epa.gov</a> and note news releases 

for Oct. 18). So we read the actual report and related background 

material. Here are a few things the EPA didn't tell you: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In the release, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman hailed a 

recent National Governors Association (NGA) policy as a &quot;remarkable 

step forward&quot; toward addressing pollution from electric power 

plants. This is unfortunate and misleading propaganda. In fact, 

during its recent annual meeting, NGA adopted a policy similar to 

that of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI): it urged changes in 

EPA's &quot;new source review&quot; program to promote &quot;fuel diversity,&quot; 

which is code language for increased coal burning. NGA also 

mimicked EEI rhetoric by calling for &quot;regulatory certainty&quot; and a 

&quot;flexible, market-based program.&quot; Again, like EEI, the governors 

opposed any mandatory reductions of the heat-trapping gas carbon 

dioxide. It's no wonder, by the way, that NGA came up with such a 

blatantly pro-industry approach. The policy was developed behind 

closed doors without input from the general public. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Despite progress in reducing pollution, EPA's press release 

neglected to mention that more than 121 million people were still 

living in areas that violated basic public health standards in 

2000. In a footnote to its report, EPA noted that &quot;this number may 

increase&quot; as new monitors go up to track fine particulate soot. 

These sobering statistics dramatically underscore the continuing 

need for enforceable programs to protect air quality at the state 

and local level. Unfortunately, EPA's Whitman has said that she, 

like industry, would like to scuttle many of those programs, 

including new source review. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- EPA's release failed to note that smog-and-soot-forming 

nitrogen oxides emissions actually increased by three percent 

during the past decade. This is mainly due to increased emissions 

from diesel trucks and buses and from so-called &quot;nonroad&quot; diesel 

engines, including construction equipment. The pollution increase 

underscores the need to press ahead with efforts to clean up diesel 

trucks and highway diesel fuel (the oil industry is suing to block 

EPA's cleanup plan) as well as for EPA to initiate a bold new 

initiative to clean up nonroad diesel engines and diesel fuel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- EPA's release failed to note the shocking fact that during 

the past decade, smog levels rose in 29 of our national parks, 

including &quot;significant upward trends&quot; in the Great Smoky Mountains, 

the Everglades, Yellowstone, Yosemite and Canyonlands, among 

others. The fine print of EPA's report also suggests that 

visibility is becoming worse at western national parks. These 

statistics underscore the need to move forward with tough &quot;regional 

haze&quot; rules, which Whitman has said she would like to eliminate, as 

well as to maintain new source review requirements. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- EPA failed to note that a recent National Academy of Sciences 

report found that mercury exposure may cause neurological problems 

in 60,000 children born in the U.S. each year. Or that 40 states 

have issued fish consumption warnings because of mercury. Or that 

electric power plants are the biggest source of mercury. EPA has 

discussed eliminating upcoming EPA &quot;toxic&quot; air pollutant rules on 

mercury in favor of a system that would allow utilities to buy and 

sell toxic mercury &quot;credits.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- EPA's release also failed to note that greenhouse gas 

emissions in the U.S. rose 11 percent between 1990 and 1998. 

Electric utility emissions went up even more. Obviously, the 

&quot;voluntary&quot; reduction efforts touted in EPA's press release aren't 

doing the job. </font></p>
