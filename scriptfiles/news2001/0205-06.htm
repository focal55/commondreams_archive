- February 5 - Greenpeace called on Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to take a firm line in opposing the new administration's plans for a National Missile Defense (NMD) system -often referred to as "Star Wars" - during his first visit today with President George W. Bush.

<p>

"As the first foreign leader to visit President Bush, the Canadian Prime Minister is in a unique position to influence U.S. policy," said Greenpeace U.S. spokesperson Rose Young. "Prime Minister Chretien must be clear with President Bush: if Star Wars proceeds, nuclear dangers will increase for Americans, Canadians and the rest of the world."  

</p>

<p>

Should it proceed, the multi-billion Star Wars system will undermine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and ignite a new nuclear arms race. Young warned that nuclear weapons states have indicated they will not let the Untied States' attempts to construct a shield go unanswered.  They perceive "Star Wars" as offensive, rather than defensive, and will step up measures to expand and modernize their nuclear arsenals in order to counter the system.

</p>

<p>

"The world will be threatened with more nuclear weapons if the Bush administration proceeds with Star Wars," said Young. "Prime Minister Chretien must take a firm line with President Bush. Canada must withhold political as well as any material support."   

</p>

<p>

Indeed, at the Munich Conference on Security Policy over the weekend, Russia's national security adviser, Sergei Ivanov, voiced concern about the U.S. stance on NMD in a speech to the conference, saying it undermines international stability and threatens to spark "a new arms race." Defense and foreign ministers from NATO nations echoed this position in speeches at in the conference.

</p>

<p>

Observers have noted that the Bush administration will likely use economic and other influence to persuade Canada to support Star Wars. Canada has been taking a cautious line on NMD, pointing out problems with the proposed plans but stopping short of an outright rejection.  

</p>

<p>

"Chretien must not allow himself to be bullied and cave in," said Greenpeace Canada campaign director Jo Dufay.  "This is a critical moment for the security of both our countries and the rest of the world."

</p>

<p>

Other important environmental issues for discussion between the two leaders today include air pollution, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Softwood Lumber Agreement and the Kyoto global warming agreement.  "Our two countries are in a unique position to protect the planet.  We urge our leaders make the most of this historic opportunity."  Young and Dufay concurred.
