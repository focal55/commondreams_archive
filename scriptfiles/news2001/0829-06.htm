- August 29 -  The awards show will take place on September 10, 2001 at Lincoln Center in New York. Britell will be joined by Marlo Thomas, Christy Turlington, Lilly Tartikoff, Heather Mills, and Sarah Ferguson, The Duchess Of York. Britell will receive her award from Keynote Speaker, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By all appearances, the Irish-Catholic, former military wife, Britell was an unlikely candidate to become a crusader for abortion rights.   But in that, Maureen Britell has managed to use her own personal story as a way to make it clear that abortion is a concern of every woman and that this issue crosses ethnic, religious, political and socio-economic boundaries. In 1994 Britell underwent a late-term abortion herself in 1994 when her pregnancy was diagnosed with anencephaly, meaning that the brain had not developed.    The experience completely transformed Britell's entire belief system.  She became a voice for women - a voice demanding that no woman should have to carry a doomed pregnancy to term. This native from Red Bank, New Jersey joined the abortion-rights advocacy movement in 1997 when she testified before Congress during joint hearings on banning "partial birth" abortions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the day that Britell added her voice to Voters for Choice, hundreds of thousands of other voices have joined in the fight.  To date, VFC has received a record $2,000,000 in contributions since Maureen's arrival.  </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, Britell has launched a landmark legal challenge that could have historic ramifications for every woman in our nation.  Right now there is a federal ban on military coverage of abortions unless the woman is dying.  This ban extends even if it is determined that the baby will not survive, as was in the case with Britell's pregnancy.  Britell is courageously challenging this ban.  If won, this case could be on the same scale in its influence as Roe vs. Wade, providing federal funding for abortions for not only women in military service, but also women using Medicaid and Medicare.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With innovative strategies to reach the public and influence lawmakers, Britell's influence at Voters for Choice has already created a wave of unprecedented results and left an indelible mark on the abortion rights movement.
