- February 9 - Genetically  engineered "Golden Rice" containing provitamin A will not solve  the problem of malnutrition in developing countries according to  Greenpeace. The Genetic Engineering (GE) industry claims  vitamin A rice could save thousands of children from blindness  and millions of malnourished people from vitamin A deficiency  (VAD) related diseases. But a simple calculation based on the  product developers' own figures show an adult would have to eat  at least twelve times the normal intake of 300 grams to get the  daily recommended amount of provitamin A.(1)     

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Syngenta, one of the world's leading genetic engineering  companies and pesticide producers, which owns many patents on  the "Golden Rice", claims a single month of marketing delay of  "Golden Rice" would cause 50.000 children to go blind.(2)  </font></P>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace calculations show however, that an adult would have  to eat at least 3.7 kilos of dry weight rice, i.e. around 9 kilos of  cooked rice, to satisfy his/her daily need of vitamin A from  "Golden Rice". In other words, a normal daily intake of 300 gram  of rice would, at best, provide 8% percent of the vitamin A  needed daily. A breast-feeding woman would have to eat at least  6.3 kilos in dry weight, converting to nearly 18 kilos of cooked rice  per day. (3) </font></P>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It is clear from these calculations that the GE industry is making  false promises about "Golden Rice". It is a nonsense to think  anyone would or could eat this much rice, and there is still no  proof that it can provide any significant vitamin benefits anyway,"  said Greenpeace Campaigner Von Hernandez in the Philippines,  where the first grains of the genetically engineered rice had been  delivered to the International Rice Research Institute last month  for breeding into local rice varieties. "This whole project is  actually based on what can only be characterised as intentional  deception. We recalculated their figures again and again, we just  could not believe serious scientists and companies would do this." </font></P>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, one of the main sponsors of "Golden Rice", the  Rockefeller Foundation, has told Greenpeace the GE industry has  "gone too far" in its promotion of the product. While upholding its  principal support for the project, Rockefeller Foundation President  Gordon Conway, wrote to Greenpeace:  

"[…] the public relations uses of Golden Rice have gone too  far. The industry's advertisements and the media in general  seem to forget that it is a research product that needs  considerable further development before it will be available  to farmers and consumers.". </font></P>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The European markets have resoundingly rejected GE products,  consumers worldwide don't want them in their food, and the  industry is desperate for alternative markets. "Golden Rice" has  been presented as a quick fix for a global problem. It isn't, and the  cash-driven propaganda about the product is swamping attempts  to enforce existing effective solutions, and carry out further work  on other sustainable, reliable methods to address the problem,"  added Hernandez.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Genetically engineered rice does not address the underlying  causes of vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which are mainly poverty  and lack of access to a more diverse diet. For the short-term,  measures such as supplementation (i.e. pills) and food fortification  are cheap and effective. Promoting the use and the access to  food naturally rich in provitamin A, such as red palm oil, will also  help addressing the VAD related sufferings. The only long-term  solution is to work on the root causes of poverty and to ensure  access to a diverse and healthy diet. (4)

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(5) Nutritionists have pointed out that numerous problems  converge to cause vitamin A      deficiency. In a recent letter to  the New York Times, Dr. Marion Nestle noted that "conversion  of beta carotene to vitamin A, and transport in the body to the  tissues that use vitamin A, require diets adequate in fat and  protein. People whose diets lack these nutrients or who have  intestinal diarrheal diseases - common in developing countries -  can not obtain Vitamin A from Golden Rice." </font>
