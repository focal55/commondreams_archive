<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- August 29 - "This week's announcement

that the federal government will have to dip into the Social

Security trust fund is a tragedy for seniors who desperately need

prescription drug coverage," according to Max Richtman, executive

vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social

Security and Medicare. "The loss of tax revenue due to the

President's tax cuts and the slowing economy will lead to new

federal debt and $600 billion in additional interest payments over

the next 10 years -- enough to pay for a generous prescription drug

benefit under Medicare," he added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Now, it looks like the federal government will have to pay

bondholders instead of providing seniors with the help they need on

prescription drugs. That is a case of misplaced priorities," he

said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration also announced this week that it would ignore

the $300 billion set aside by Republicans and Democrats in Congress

for prescription drug coverage and limit itself to a benefit that

costs no more than $190 billion over 10 years. "Seniors would be

smart to use their tax refund to pay for prescription drugs -- it

may be the only assistance they get to meet their prescription drug

needs for some time," he said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The $600 billion could fund a prescription drug program with

copayments and deductibles at a level that is more affordable for

all seniors," Richtman said. "Alternatively, some of those

funds could be used to fund a more modest drug benefit, while at

the same time, leaving money to address some of the other unmet

health care needs of senior citizens in this country. The quality

of life for millions is diminished because they can't afford to get

their glasses repaired, get their dentures refitted or get a new

battery for their hearing aids. None of these costs are covered by

Medicare," he said.
