- April 17 - News Advisory:

<p>Current U.S. nuclear weapons policy is both obsolete and

dangerous. Thousands of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons stand ready

to launch at a moment's notice. Yet a preemptive Russian "bolt

from the blue" is no longer a realistic threat. A mistaken Russian

launch due to a false warning of attack is a far greater threat to

U.S. security.

<p>Congress and the Bush administration both see the need for

change. Congress required the new administration to conduct a full

review of U.S. nuclear policy, which the White House expects to

complete this summer. The review, which will determine U.S. nuclear

policy, posture, and arsenal size, will have serious implications

for global security. Come hear experts in the field discuss the

major issues at stake, including:

<p>-- At whom does the United States target its nuclear weapons,

and why?

-- What country is the biggest threat: the faltering Russian

Bear, North Korea, China?

-- How does national missile defense fit into future U.S. policy?

-- How many nuclear weapons does the United States need and must

they be on alert?

-- Should future U.S.-Russian arms reductions be binding or

carried out informally?

-- Should U.S. nuclear weapons be used to deter chemical and

biological weapon threats?
