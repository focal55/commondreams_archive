- September 14 -  The events of September 11, 2001 and the enormous loss of life caused by terrorist acts in New York City and Washington, DC are a horror and a tragedy. As an organization working since 1977

<i> to ensure global survival </i> and to create a world that <i> affirms life</i>, where people can adequately meet their basic human needs, and where security is based on cooperation and community,

<i> Infact condemns these and all acts of violence</i> and disregard for human life. Our hearts go out to the victims and their loved ones.

<P align="left">

The pain and suffering will likely grow in the coming days and weeks as the full scope of this tragedy unfolds. We dread potential news of Infact supporters, members, allies and friends lost in these attacks. Yet at the same time, we are reminded of the best of humanity, and we are finding strength and courage to move forward. We extend our deepest appreciation for the heartfelt messages of solidarity and support from Infact’s allies around the world, including members of the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals.

As Infact challenges life-threatening abuses by transnational corporations, we are mindful that these deadly events warn of

<i> growing anger felt around the world against US corporate and military

institutions</i>. This anger has now made a profound and painful impact on the US and its people. But violence and acts of terrorism will not remedy damage caused by US foreign policy or US-based corporations.

<P align="left">

People around the world are desperately seeking ways to counter globalization that comes at the expense of people and the environment. Infact’s campaigns provide people at the grassroots with opportunities, through

<i> coordinated, constructive and non-violent action, to hold transnational corporations accountable</i> for their policies and practices-approaches that are proven to be effective. Since 1993, Infact has focused our organizing on the tobacco industry, targeting

<i> Philip Morris and other corporations that devalue human life</i> by promoting an addictive and deadly product. At a time when the need to

<i> affirm human life and civil rights</i> is urgent, we recommit ourselves to Campaigns which have already begun to redefine the power relationship between giant corporations and ordinary people. 

<P align="left">

While we support justice and accountability for those responsible for these acts, we oppose vengeance or retaliation that will

<i> escalate the violence</i>. We are well aware that abusive practices of TNCs disproportionately affect

<i> those with the least power in society</i>-people of color, women, lesbians and gays, poor and working people-and we are deeply concerned that crackdowns on civil liberties also target those most marginalized by race, ethnicity (and particularly we fear an anti-Arab backlash), class, gender, sexual orientation, religious and political views. In bringing to justice those responsible for the attacks in New York and Washington, DC our government must not rush to judgment, and must

<i> respect civil and human rights of all people.</i>
