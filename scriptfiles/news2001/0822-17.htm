<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK CITY 

- August 22 - Ten members of Voices in the Wilderness have just been arrested after bringing a symbolic

meal of lentils and rice to the steps of the US Mission to the UN, inviting members of the staff and the Ambassador&#146;s

office to share the meal across from the US Mission to the UN, (45th Street and First

Avenue).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of the group are on the seventeenth day of a 40 day fast calling for an

end to sanctions against Iraq.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, the NYPD arrested twelve people for

approaching the steps of the US Mission with their meal and their message.&nbsp; Charged

with obstruction and criminal trespass, they face trial on September 20.&nbsp; Fasters

returned today to continue bringing their message to the US Mission, some of them having

recently traveled to Iraq, in direct violation of US law and the 11 year embargo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among them , Kathy Kelly, nominated for

this year&#146;s Nobel Peace Prize, states, &#147;We are trying to encourage the member

states of the UN to &#145;break ranks&#146; with the US in its insistence on endless

sanctions for Iraq.&nbsp; We also ask for the US to seek reconciliation with the peoples

of Iraq, to stop the continued bombing and terror, and to embrace&nbsp;peaceful

means to solve any conflict between the two nations.&#148;

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those arrested are Ceylon Mooney, Memphis, TN, Kathy Kelly, Chicago, IL, MikiLu Peters,

Chicago, IL, Nate Peters,&nbsp; Chicago, IL, Rev. Jerry Zawada, OFM, Hammond, IN, Peter De

Mott, Ithaca, NY,&nbsp; Athir Shayota, Harlem, NY, Ed Lewinson, New Jersey, Felton Davis,

New York, NY, Cynthia Banas,&nbsp; Vernon, NY. In an August 20, 2001 letter of invitation

to the US Mission to the UN, the group wrote: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We are again inviting you to partake with us in a simple meal of cooked lentils, rice, and

bread, along with unpurified water, (we don&#146;t want to drink it and neither do Iraqi

people).&nbsp; The meal symbolizes our concern because many Iraqis have subsisted on this

food for eleven years.&nbsp; It also represents our earnest interest in breaking bread

with you.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We&#146;d like to discuss the perspective of Mr.Hubert Vedrine, the French Foreign

Minister, who stated: &#147;Economic sanctions on Iraq are &#147;cruel, ineffective and

dangerous:&nbsp; They are cruel because they punish exclusively Iraqi people and the

weakest 

among them.&nbsp; They are ineffective because they don&#146;t touch the regime which is

not encouraged to cooperate and they are dangerous because they&#133;accentuate the

disintegration of Iraqi society.&#148;&nbsp; (Hubert Vedrine, August 2, 2000, <em>Reuters</em>)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several of us have seen and heard,&nbsp; first hand, evidence of the disintegration

Mr.Vedrine deplores.&nbsp; We mean you no harm 

or inconvenience in wanting to talk with you.&nbsp; And of course we are easily available

as we vigil outside your building each day.</font></p>
