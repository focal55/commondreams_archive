<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- December 11 - Recent news reports claim that President Bush has apparently decided to

announce a withdrawal from the treaty. Withdrawing from the ABM Treaty now

is both unnecessary and unwise. Unnecessary because virtually all

scientific experts believe that the U.S. can continue to test a missile

defense system without breaking the ABM Treaty for many years to come.

Unwise because it could start a chain reaction that jeopardizes the three

decades of progress the United States has made in reducing the threat from

nuclear weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those three decades of progress were made possible in part by the treaty

that President Bush now wants to discard. Although the Cold War is over,

the United States and Russia still deploy thousands of nuclear weapons on

hair trigger alert status. As long as that is the case, the ABM Treaty will

be the cornerstone of international security and nuclear arms reductions.

To withdraw from the treaty to satisfy the ideological whims of the Bush

Administration is reckless.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ideologues within the Bush Administration -- the same group that last

week helped scuttle the Geneva, Switzerland conference to review and

strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention -- have won another battle to

destroy arms control and permit the United States to act unilaterally

abroad against the views of the rest of the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush's decision to withdraw from the treaty would allow the Administration

to begin construction on  missile defense facilities in Alaska next spring.

 The fact is we are years away from having any workable and reliable

missile defense system ready to deploy in Alaska or anywhere else.  There

is simply no reason to abrogate the ABM Treaty now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This decision to speed up construction of facilities in Alaska does not

appear to be based on any new assessment of the threats facing the United

States from long-range ballistic missiles. It is more likely that the

President wants to fulfill a campaign pledge by installing some missile

defense system in Alaska by 2004, even if it does not work.
