In Final Hours as President, Clinton Promises Israel the Not-Yet-Built F-22</div>

- January 19 - Despite reluctance from some on Capitol Hill to start full-scale

production, President Clinton today promised Israel that it would be the

first country to purchase the United States' most advanced fighter

aircraft, the F-22 Raptor.  Even had he not already lifted almost every

U.S. arms export barrier, the promise to sell the radar-evading, stealth

aircraft to Israel would solidify Clinton's legacy as the most arms export

happy President in U.S. history.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is unprecedented for a U.S. president to promise the most

technologically advanced weapon in the world to a foreign country before it

has been produced.  While Clinton's promise does not bind the new

administration to sell the jets to Israel, it puts the new President in a

very difficult position.  If Congress decides to build the troubled F-22,

it will be difficult for future administrations to refuse to sell the jet

to Israel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even worse, Mr. Clinton has now put the United States in an arms race with

itself.  First, the the United Arab Emirates purchased F-16s superior to

our own.  Now the F-22 could be sold to Israel.  It is not unconceivable

that Saudi Arabia will next be in line for our most sophisticated aircraft.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before the F-22 is even built, America's defense companies will have to

start designing an even more advance plane. No longer is the Soviet Union

driving the Pentagon's quest for better and better weapons, it is our own

arms exports.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his final days in office, President Clinton has frantically maneuvered

to solidify his legacy on domestic issues.  But his most peculiar legacy

may be the contradictory role he played as Middle East arms dealer and

peace broker.  While the soon to be ex-President submerged himself into the

minutiae of Middle East peace politics, he also shuttled his Secretary of

Defense around the region to sell American weapons.  Even the

vice-President got involved in the act in May 1998 when he presided over a

rose garden celebration of the UAE decision to purchase 80 F-16 fighter

jets worth over $7 billion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clinton did not, however, only hang out the &quot;Arms for Sale! Everything Must

Go!&quot; shingle for Middle Eastern customers.  He also lifted a ban on the

sale of high-tech weaponry to Latin America, in place since the Carter

administration.  As a result, the administration indicated just weeks ago

that it would approve the sale of nearly a dozen F-16 fighter jets to Chile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some might characterize Clinton's foreign policy as a disorganized failure.

 But when it came to the sale of lethal weaponry, this administration did

almost everything it could, short of selling fighter aircraft to Iran, to

keep America the world's number one arms dealer.
