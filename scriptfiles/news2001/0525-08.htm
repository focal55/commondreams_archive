<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN JOSE, CA 

- May 25 - On Saturday June 2nd, from 9 am- 4:30 pm will be Silicon Valley's First Teach-In on Globalization, Free Trade, and the Third World Debt at the First Unitarian Church, 160 N. Third Street in San Jose, California.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

     From Seattle to Prague, from Washington D.C. to Quebec City, protesters are challenging corporate rule, as found in the destructive policies of the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The World Bank cancelled its June 25-27th meeting in Barcelona due to fears of disruptions from civil society. By moving conferences to cyberspace and remote authoritarian countries, such as Qatar - where the WTO is holding its next Ministerial in November, the increasingly unpopular institutions of the global economy are admitting defeat in the court of world popular opinion.  </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The morning program begins with Founder and Acting Director of International Forum on Globalization (IFG), Jerry Mander who will clarify the links between a multiplicity of issues including trade, technology, poverty, and corporate power. Antonia Juhasz, IFG Project Director, will address the FTAA, the General Agreement on Trades and Services (GATS), and the Threat to the World's Water. Raj Jayadev, Silicon Valley De-Bug, a leading activist, highlighted in the film- Secrets of Silicon Valley, will reveal how the world's shiny capital of hi-technology has overshadowed a darker reality for many youth of color working not &quot;on-line&quot; but &quot;on the line&quot; of chip manufacturing plants, where temporary status and dangerous working conditions are the consequences of the computer revolution. Sasha Khokha, National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, will explain how globalization displaces people from their homelands and how export-oriented production zones, create new waves of refugees who are denied the most basic human rights. Victor Menotti, IFG Environmental Director, will look at the policies of Free Trade and the Debt Trap that are pitting local communities against global corporations in a struggle for the control of natural resources. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

     In the afternoon, a dozen workshops, orchestrated by local groups, will engage the participants to deepen their understanding and strengthen connections between the local and the global struggles, and to begin organizing. </font></p>
