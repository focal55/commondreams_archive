- February 23 - Today, Bluewater Network blasted  a corporate publicity

stunt to retrace the epic journey of famed explorers Meriwether Lewis and

William Clark with noisy and highly-polluting personal watercraft (PWC).

PWC, better known by the trade name jetski are designed and marketed as

adrenaline pumping thrill-craft.  Unfortunately, those thrills come at the

expense of air and water quality, visitor enjoyment, public health and

safety, natural quiet, and fish and wildlife.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a press release, a major PWC manufacturer states that &quot;environmentally

friendly&quot; PWC equipped with a type of direct injected (DI) two-stroke

engine will be used for the ride.  However, government agencies and

universities have discovered that PWC, even with the DI technology, still

produce staggering amounts of air and water pollution.  According to the

California Air Resources Board (CARB), DI two-strokes churn out nearly ten

times more smog forming pollution than a comparable four-stroke engine.  In

addition, CARB reports that DI machines spew into the water several highly

damaging pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).

According to researchers at Michigan State University, PAH -even in the

minute levels of parts per trillion - are toxic to plants and wildlife.  As

for noise, even the new technologies run under normal operating conditions

can produce noise levels as high as 101 dBs - similar to conventional PWC.

By comparison, a busy city street produces 85 dBs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, prototype engines are unlikely to improve the dismal safety

record of the contraptions.  According to the most recent US Coast Guard

data, PWC represent roughly five percent of all numbered boats on the water

but are responsible for more than 30 percent of all accidents, roughly 50

percent of boat collisions, approximately 40 percent of all boating

injuries and ten percent of all boating related fatalities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Using jetskis to retrace the path of Lewis and Clark makes about as much

sense as driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee along the forced march of Cherokee

Indians over the Trail of Tears,&quot; said Sean Smith, Public Lands Director

for Bluewater Network.  &quot;Furthermore, given the dismal environmental

performance and the horrific safety record of jetskis, one wonders if Lewis

and Clark would have successfully completed their journey if they had been

confronted by the craft.&quot;
