- September 24 - According to Physicians for 

Social Responsibility (PSR), residents of Arizona could experience 

increased health risks as a result of climate change. These threats 

are outlined in &quot;Death by Degrees: The Health Threats of Climate 

Change in Arizona,&quot; a new 40-page report released today by PSR. 

Arizonans are used to living with extremes in climate, with sharp 

differences in rainfall across the state and temperature variations 

sometimes changing by 50 degrees or more within a single day. But 

the changes projected during the next 100 years could provide the 

greatest challenge yet. According to physicians who have studied 

global warming and its potential effects, Arizona residents will 

experience a wide range of increased health risks. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Higher temperatures will have an adverse effect on human health, 

particularly for the elderly. Arizona currently holds the 

unfortunate distinction of being one of two states with the highest 

annual age-adjusted rate for heat-related deaths. By the year 2025, 

Arizona's population is expected to increase between 25 and 40 

percent and more than one-fifth of the population will be over the 

age of 65. Some experts project a rise in the heat index of 8 

degrees to 15 degrees Farenheit during the next century. Another 

commonly used model projects the heat index will increase by more 

than 25 degrees Fahrenheit. That means, for example, a July day in 

Phoenix that currently reaches a heat index of 110-degrees 

Fahrenheit could reach a heat index of more than 135-degrees 

Fahrenheit! </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heavy rainfall and flooding are also projected to increase as a 

result of climate change. Flash floods cause the largest number of 

weather related deaths in the U.S. each year. Flooding is 

particularly dangerous in arid climates like Arizona, where a 

normally dry arroyo can transform to a rapidly flowing body of 

water in a matter of seconds. Some scientists also believe there is 

a link between heavy precipitation and an increase in the number of 

rodents carrying Hantavirus. As storm activity increases with 

climate change, the incidence of contaminating run off may also 

increase. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is likely to be decreased air quality in the state due to 

increased ozone (smog) levels, leading to more frequent and severe 

attacks of asthma and other respiratory problems. Ozone-related 

health problems already warrant high concern in the state. Maricopa 

County (Phoenix) had 74 &quot;Orange Alert&quot; days from 1997 to 1999. 

For the 40,000 children with asthma and 70,000 adults with asthma 

that live in Maricopa Country, ozone is of special concern. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Climate change poses a serious threat to public health,&quot; said 

Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., MPH, Executive Director and CEO of PSR, a 

nonprofit organization representing 20,000 health professionals 

nationwide. &quot;We hope that people will read this report, understand 

what is at stake, and make their concerns known to their elected 

leaders.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Death by Degrees&quot; lays out specific opportunities for personal 

and political actions needed to combat global warming. The Arizona 

report is the 11th in a planned series of 12 state specific reports 

in which PSR describes the effects that rising world temperatures 

may have on local communities. Free copies of the report are 

available to the public through the PSR national office 

(202-667-4260) or on line at <a href="http://www.psr.org/arizona" target="_new">http://www.psr.org/arizona</a> </font></p>
