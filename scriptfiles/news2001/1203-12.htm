- December 3 - The Sierra Club today praised the Senate for voting to

keep inappropriate and irresponsible amendments out of the Railroad

Retirement Bill.  The Senate defeated an attempt by Senate Minority Leader

Trent Lott to attach to the bill controversial House Energy legislation,

which allows for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and does

not adequately address the need for improved fuel economy standards.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're pleased that the Senate has once again acknowledged that this fall

is not the time to rush through controversial energy policies, including

drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive

Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;But it's very unfortunate that there continue

to be Senators who are willing to delay important and unrelated legislation

to further their own irresponsible agenda.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of pursuing a destructive energy policy like the one proposed in

the House energy plan, the Senate can secure our energy future by making

our cars and homes more energy efficient and developing new, clean energy

sources such as solar and wind power.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans do not have to sacrifice the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to

reduce our reliance on oil, help our military, or achieve energy security.

The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there's only a six month supply of oil

to be found in the Arctic and even the oil industry admits it will take a

decade to bring that oil on line. And drilling the Arctic Refuge won't make

a dent in our dependence on foreign oil or strengthen our national

security. In fact, oil from the Arctic Refuge would be extremely vulnerable

to terrorist attack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are other cheaper, cleaner, safer and more efficient ways to move

toward energy independence. Making cars and trucks go farther on a gallon

of gas is the single biggest step Americans can take to decrease our oil

dependence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope that the Senate will continue to support protecting the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge and oppose those who would try to take advantage

of our national crisis to push these controversial and irresponsible

policies,&quot; Pope said.
