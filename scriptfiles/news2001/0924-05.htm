<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON- September 24 - Today, the Washington Post reported that the Bush administration has asked

Congress to lift all restrictions on U.S. weapons exports and military

assistance through 2007.  This short- sighted and dangerous proposal goes

beyond providing assistance to those countries on the front lines of the

new fight against terrorism, and gives the President free reign to discard

laws and policies carefully crafted over the last fifty years to keep

weapons out of the hands of governments and terrorists who may threaten

U.S. national security.   Congress should not write the President a blank

check and abdicate its responsibility to regulate the export U.S. military

weapons and supplies.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">History has taught the United States that the indiscriminate export of U.S.

weaponry has resulted in a decrease in U.S. security.  At one time, Iran

and Iraq, countries currently on the U.S. state-sponsored terrorism list,

were close allies and major U.S. arms clients.  U.S.-made Stinger

anti-aircraft weapons that it gave to the Afghan resistance in the 1980s

may also pose a threat to U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.  The

administration should not repeat past mistakes by indiscriminately

exporting weapons for short term goals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration's proposal to lift all restrictions on U.S.

military aid, weapons and training is reckless in its scope.  The proposed

legislation reads: &quot;The President may provide assistance or take any other

action, sell or authorize the export of defense articles or defense

services, or issue credit, credit guarantees or extend other financial

assistance ... if to do so is important to United States efforts to respond

to, deter or prevent acts of international terrorism or other actions

threatening international peace and security.&quot; [emphasis added]</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of creating a blanket weapons export authority for the President,

Congress should make specific changes to U.S. law where it hinders the

President's ability to provide allies with the equipment or assistance they

need to address the terrorist threat.  U.S. weapons exports should continue

to support the underlying values of U.S. foreign policy - democracy, free

market economies and respect for human rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The events of September 11 demonstrate that the U.S. must take steps to

protect the country and bring to justice those responsible for the attacks.

 Lifting all restrictions on U.S. arms exports to any country willing to

provide rhetorical support for the &quot;war against terrorism&quot; may provide

human rights violators engaged in internal or regional disputes the

equipment to imprison, torture or kill their own people. In an effort to

fight the terrorist threat, the U.S. should not adopt policies which will

lead to an erosion of the very principles of freedom, democracy and a

respect for civilian life that are traditional American values.  As the

President has said, the tragic events of September 11 have changed our

world, but they have not undermined our determination to uphold our basic

principals.</font></p>
