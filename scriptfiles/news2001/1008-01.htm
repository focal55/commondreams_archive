international justice and measures to promote

stability, relief, and democracy; in the U.S.,

assistance for airline workers, rebuilding New York

with union labor</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

WASHINGTON - October 8 -  The Green Party of the United

States sees expansion of the conflict and risks of

nuclear deployment in the wake of the unilateral

military strikes begun on Sunday, October 7 in

retaliation for the September 11 attacks, and urges

the U.S. to undertake steps to promote stability,

relief, and democracy in Afghanistan and neighboring

nations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If military action by the U.S. destabilizes the

region, new security problems will emerge,&quot; said Kara

Ceriello, chair of the Green Party of Washington

State.  &quot;One of the greatest risks is the fall of

Pakistan's military government, which rules over a

large population that includes religious

fundamentalists sympathetic to the Taliban and to

Osama bin Laden.  Pakistan possesses nuclear weapons.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The current unilateral military assaults risk being

perceived as attacks on Islam, and may undermine

international support for the U.S., inflame further

terrorism, imperil Israel, and escalate the conflict

into a greater war.  Greens especially oppose any

attempt by President Bush to wage war outside the

scrutiny of Congress and the American people, and note

that the U.S. Constitution addresses war powers

explicitly and does not grant presidents 'blank check'

power to wage war.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Green Party members say that a major lesson of the

September 11 attacks is that technology cannot ensure

security and can be turned against us, and that

justice for the attacks must be sought through an

internationally cooperative police effort to apprehend

the perpetrators and try them in an international

tribunal for crimes against humanity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Pentagon has already conceded that its strategy

of fighting two consecutive fronts was misplaced,&quot;

noted Nathalie Paravicini, secretary of the Green

Party of the United States.  &quot;Technologies proposed to

protect the nation, such as space-based national

missile defense schemes, have already proved

irrelevant and divert vast resources in time and

people power.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Related risks include a nuclear tactical strike by the

U.S., including deployment of a tactical nuclear

weapon (research and development for which was

undertaken during the 1990s) designed to destroy

heavily fortified caves sheltering the September 11

criminals, and attacks on nuclear power plants that

risk Chernobyl-style disasters in densely populated

areas.  Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld

revealed on September 23 that the U.S. has not ruled

out the use of nuclear strikes.  Also, terrorist

networks may be in contact with Saddam Hussein, who is

believed to possess nuclear, biological, and chemical

materials for weapons, representing a further threat

if the conflict escalates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens insist that the U.S. must undertake positive

steps to ensure regional stability, generate good will

towards the U.S., and promote economic

self-sufficiency and democracy: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Provision of food and medicine to Afghanis who

suffer from drought and an economic disaster

aggravated by the Taliban's oppressive regime and a

continuing civil war.  One model for such action is

Oxfam America's call for relief

&lt;<a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/humanitarian/afghanistan/index.html" target="_new">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/humanitarian/afghanistan/index.html</a>&gt;.

 President Bush has discussed this; it should be an

American priority.  The U.S. can also provide

assistance for Afghanistan to convert its agriculture

from poppies for opiates to internally sustainable

food and fiber crops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Ending U.S. policies that seek to maintain and

extend control over and dependence on Middle Eastern

oil.  American domination of resources in Arab and

Muslim nations motivates much of the antipathy to the

U.S., of which bin Laden's movement represents the

violent extreme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** International agreements that reverse nuclear

proliferation, and measures to keep nuclear plants in

the U.S. and around the world safe, while recognizing

them as permanent hazards and dismantling them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Ending the sanctions and raids on Iraqi

infrastructure that have resulted in the deaths of

hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, including a

half million children; working to resolve the conflict

between Palestinians and Israelis in way that ensures

the security of both and guarantee human rights and

the right of return for Palestinians; and supporting

other resolutions to regional conflicts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Ending policies that assist, arm, and train

fanatics, drug dealers, and other criminals around the

world -- as the CIA did in launching the careers of

Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While helping to rebuild and restabilize Afghanistan

and other nations, the U.S. can take humane steps at

home:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Relief and assistance for airline workers, as well

as other victims of the September 11 attacks,

including janitors, building personnel and security,

kitchen workers, and administrative staff at the World

Trade Center and surrounding buildings and the

Pentagon, and their families.  The current bail-out

for the airline industry only benefits CEOs and

investors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** A project to rebuild New York, with union labor,

union pay, and worker safety, and in accord with

lessons learned about the special safety problems of

large buildings.</font></p>
