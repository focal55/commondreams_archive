- April 12 - Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth today attacked the new proposal for a European Council decision on the 6th Framework programme 2000-2006 "of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for research". The document proposes EUR 1.23 billion funding for nuclear projects: EUR 330 million for the Joint Research Centre's Euratom activities, EUR 150 million for the treatment and storage of nuclear waste, EUR 50 million for other Euratom activities, and EUR 700 million for nuclear fusion. 

<p>Since 1991 no new nuclear reactor has been ordered in any EU country. Seven of the EU's 15 member states are non-nuclear, another 4 (Germany, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands) are in the process of phasing-out nuclear power.

<p>Tobias Muenchmeyer, Greenpeace nuclear expert:

"EU countries are getting out of nuclear power. There is no need for more research in a technology which is dying out. EURO 530 million for nuclear power research is plainly a subsidy to Europe's increasingly desperate nuclear industry and blocks the pathway towards sustainable energy solutions."

<p>Another EUR 700 million is earmarked for "controlled thermonuclear fusion". Even the Euratom Scientific and Technical Committee (STC) admitted in a report last year that, "fusion is an energy option which has the potential to play a key role in a long-term perspective (>50 years) ...".

<p>Patricia Lorenz, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe:

"The commercial use of nuclear fusion is pure fantasy. Already 25 years ago the same people had predicted that in 50 years fusion would be a viable energy resource, but it seems like we are always 50 years away from fusion becoming economic. The European Council has to stop this waste of millions of taxpayers money." 

<p>At EUR 1.23 billion, the proposed budget for 2002-2006 is about the same as the budget for the years 1998-2002 which, at EUR 1.26 billion was the largest EU nuclear research budget ever. 

<p>Currently the European Commission is also considering a proposal to  raise the ceiling for Euratom loans for Eastern European nuclear projects by another EUR 2 billion. Also the budgets for the Euratom Supply Agency as well as for the Euratom Safeguards Directorate are constantly growing. 

<p>"The new budget proposal for nuclear research comes at a time when the cash-strapped nuclear industry is trying to squeeze out billions from the EU budget from all possible sides by referring to the most anachronistic Euratom treaty. The Euratom treaty is from another age and needs to be abandoned immediately.", said Patricia Lorenz.
