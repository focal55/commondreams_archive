- June 11 - Jennifer Morgan, 

director of World Wildlife Fund's climate change campaign, 

issued the following statement Monday in response to President 

Bush's latest remarks on global warming: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush's call for more research into climate change 

-- even as his energy plan would increase the carbon emissions 

that cause global warming -- is a grossly inadequate and 

irresponsible response to one of the most urgent environmental 

crises of our time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The industrialized world realized almost a decade ago that 

any solution to the looming problem of global warming would 

require binding targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide 

emissions. From that political and scientific consensus, the 

Kyoto Protocol was born. But while other nations have moved 

ahead, the United States has slipped behind. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In calling for more research into what he belatedly concedes 

is a serious problem, President Bush is catching up to U.S. 

policy as it existed 10 years ago. The rest of the world has 

moved forward in that time; so must the U.S. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Indeed, only last week, the National Academy of Sciences 

affirmed that the IPCC Third Assessment Report accurately 

reflects the current thinking of the scientific community. This 

report finds that we are already experiencing the initial 

impacts of global warming and that warming over the next century 

may be catastrophic for both human communities and biodiversity 

around the globe. Other countries have heard this wake up call 

and are moving to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and reduce emissions 

even as the Bush Administration is preparing to increase them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just last month, the Administration introduced an energy 

plan that would increase emissions of global warming pollution 

by 35 percent or more over the next 20 years. While European 

countries are moving forward to develop the clean energy 

technologies of the future, the Bush Administration appears 

content to continue to rely on the dirty technologies of the 

past. If the Administration implements their energy plan and 

their climate change proposal, the US will dramatically increase 

emissions at the same time it is spending billions of dollars to 

study the problem its emissions are creating. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We don't need a technology initiative to achieve our Kyoto 

targets, we need leadership. A 1998 WWF study showed that by 

implementing responsible energy policies using existing 

technologies, the U.S. could have achieved deeper reductions 

than required by the Kyoto Protocol, while increasing jobs by 

nearly 900,000, with a net benefit to the economy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is misleading to continue to use developing country 

emissions as an excuse for inaction. With only four percent of 

the world's population, the U.S. is the world' leading emitter 

of greenhouse gases on both a national and per capita basis. 

While President Bush complains about the Kyoto targets unfairly 

impacting the U.S., some developing countries are actually 

taking action to reduce their emissions. Since 1995 China has 

reduced its emissions by 17 percent, while US emissions grew by 

about 7 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush proposal is so far behind the current thinking on 

climate change that it is hard to imagine how the Administration 

will engage in climate change negotiations in Bonn, Germany, 

this July. If he is unwilling to lead, President Bush should 

step aside and allow the other nations of the world to implement 

the mandatory pollution reductions contained in the Kyoto 

Protocol.&quot; </font></p>
