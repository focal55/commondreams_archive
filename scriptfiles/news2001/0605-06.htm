<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GUADALAJARA, Mexico - June 5  - Bush Administration officials joined lobbyists from Monsanto and other genetic engineering firms at the First Trilateral Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology to urge Mexico to allow commercialization of gene-altered crops. The two-day meeting, which also included Canadian government representatives, has great importance for the future of corn farming since genetically engineered corn could threaten Mexico's place as the global center of corn biodiversity.

<p>"The Mexican people, not foreign industries and governments, should decide the future of this vital natural resource," said Hector Magallon, a Genetic Engineering Campaigner for Greenpeace Mexico. "The Bush Administration would endanger the world's genetic reserve of corn germplasm for the short term gain of a few huge biotech firms." The U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity gives countries sovereignty over their biodiversity.</p>

<p>

While representatives from virtually every major biotechnology company are participating in today's meeting, no citizens groups were invited other than Greenpeace, which was allowed to make a short presentation.</p>  



<p>Genetically engineered corn poses a unique threat in Mexico, where corn originated. Mexican corn biodiversity is unique on the planet, with as many as 300 local varieties that could be harmed by contamination from gene-altered corn. In the U.S., an unapproved variety of engineered corn, planted on fewer than one percent of all corn acres, contaminated millions of bushels of natural corn last fall, leading to over 300 food product recalls and major market disruptions for U.S. corn farmers. In Mexico, such genetic contamination could cause the extinction of wild corn relatives such as teocinte, which serves as a genetic reserve for corn farmers globally. The U.S. government's own scientific advisors have said: "The U.S. needs to be a steward of international germplasm resources such as the teosintes that are native south of the USA border."</p>  



<p>But the Bush Administration is heavily influenced by the biotechnology industry. In addition to campaign contributions, the industry has placed several former employees into high-ranking government posts. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman is a former Director of the genetic engineering firm Calgene, the maker of the first gene-altered crop introduced in the U.S. Calgene is now a subsidiary of Monsanto, the firm most responsible for the proliferation of genetically engineered foods in this country. Other Bush officials with ties to Monsanto include Linda Fisher, who now holds the number-two post at the Environmental Protection Agency, Attorney General John Ashcroft, Tommy Thompson (whose agency oversees the Food and Drug Administration) and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.</p>  



<p>"President Bush is handing over the world's food supply to the genetic engineers who bought him the election," said Ama Marston, Greenpeace USA Genetic Engineering Campaigner. "This Administration is willing to pollute all our food on behalf of their corporate sponsors."</p>
