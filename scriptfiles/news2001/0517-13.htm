- May 17 - "With few good ingredients in his energy plan, the president has served up a recipe for trouble. It is a smorgasbord for the coal, oil and nuclear industries and table scraps for efficiency and renewable energy. Meanwhile, the plan does almost nothing for consumers facing high electricity and gas prices. The president's energy plan will do harm to the environment and public health, while abdicating leadership on the clean energy technologies that are key to economic success in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.

<p>"President Bush is again trying to claim environmental credit for not terminating existing policies, like renewable energy tax credits.  With federal leadership, the US could obtain 20 percent of its power from renewables by 2020.  But the president’s energy plan fails to even restore the outrageous 50 percent cuts he proposed last month for DOE’s highly successful wind, solar and geothermal energy programs.  The dramatic reductions in renewable electricity costs these programs have achieved must be too threatening to his friends in the coal and nuclear industries. </p>



<p>"The tax credits for hybrid vehicles are welcome, but they are by no means a substitute for strengthened fuel efficiency standards. Simply requiring SUVs and other light trucks to be as efficient as today's cars would save drivers $190 billion over the next 15 years, and save more oil than the Arctic Wildlife Refuge could produce in 50 years.</p>



<p>"The president calls for new nuclear reactors, but the burden is on the nuclear industry to demonstrate that new designs are in fact safer than current plants, that nuclear regulators start responding to safety problems as they arise, rather than sweeping them under the rug, and that a long-term solution to nuclear waste disposal has been demonstrated. What is not acceptable is additional public subsidies for this technology, including Price-Anderson federal liability protection for new merchant plants. We should give renewable energy a first chance before we give nuclear power a second chance.</p>



<p>"When coupled with his decision to abandon negotiations on the Kyoto global warming treaty, the energy plan’s emphasis on fossil fuel production over efficiency and clean renewable energy supplies makes it crystal clear that President Bush has decided to do nothing meaningful about global warming.  The energy plan was yet another litmus test for Bush on global warming, and he failed again.</p>



<p>"The Bush energy plan is bad for the environment, does almost nothing for consumers, jeopardizes our economic competitiveness, and will worsen global warming.  The president’s energy plan flunks every test but one: boosting energy industry profits.  It can, and must, be stopped."</p>
