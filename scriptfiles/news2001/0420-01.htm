- April 20 -  The nonprofit Clean Air

Trust today awarded its clean air "Villain of the Month" award for

April to Senators James Inhofe (R-OK) and John Breaux (D-LA).

<p>The two senators earned this dubious distinction by urging Vice

President Dick Cheney to suspend and weaken a key enforcement tool

in the Clean Air Act. This enforcement tool, known as "new source

review," is designed to make sure that big polluters upgrade

pollution controls when they make major changes to expand or extend

the life of existing dirty factories or electric power plants.

<p>Many companies apparently have been flagrantly disregarding the

law. Virginia Electric Power Company (VEPCO), for example, rebuilt

the boilers at several plants and also doubled the height of the

smokestack at one plant to 730 feet to ensure that air pollution

from the facility did not fall on nearby communities. The result is

that much of the plant's emissions now drift hundreds of miles to

downwind states such as Maryland and New York.

<p>Finally, lawsuits were brought against power companies by

several environmental groups, New York State Attorney General Eliot

Spitzer, and the Clinton Administration's Justice Department and

Environmental Protection Agency.

<p>Because of these enforcement efforts, major power companies

(including VEPCO), refineries and paper mills have all agreed to

massive cleanups. As Spitzer told a Senate subcommittee earlier

this month, "These lawsuits will have absolutely no detrimental

effect on our energy supply."

<p>But Inhofe and Breaux have seized on California's energy

problems -- which, as EPA Administrator Christie Whitman has noted,

were not caused by the Clean Air Act -- as an excuse to roll back

clean air protections. "Our nation is currently facing a potential

energy crisis similar to what is happening in California," Inhofe

asserted in calling for a suspension of the clean air enforcement.

<p>It is suspected that Cheney will urge some rollback in this

enforcement effort as part of his upcoming energy plan. We note

with alarm that the Bush Administration is proposing a nearly 10

percent cut in federal environmental enforcement. (Historical

note: in ancient Rome, when the legions got rebellious, the leaders

sometimes killed one soldier in 10 as a way to keep the rest in

line. Thus the origin of the word "decimate" -- and perhaps the

thinking behind the proposed enforcement cut.)

<p>Fortunately, there is bipartisan opposition to the misguided

Inhofe-Breaux effort to let big polluters off the hook. Senators

John Kerry (D-MA) and Susan Collins (R-ME) told Cheney that they

"strenuously object" to the "invitation to disrupt enforcement of

the Clean Air Act." They noted "there is broad agreement,

reflected in Congressional testimony and elsewhere, that air

pollution laws are not causing electricity or fuel supply

shortages."

<p>Even so, those interested in clean air ought to be on the alert

against the sort of dirty-air con job promoted by Inhofe and

Breaux.
