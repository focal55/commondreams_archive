- October 8 -  "Now that the United States





and the United Kingdom have launched military strikes against targets



in Afghanistan, their forces and their Taleban opponents must ensure



full respect for human rights and the rules and principles governing



international armed conflicts," Amnesty International said today, on



the second day of military attacks. Since the Sept. 11 attacks,



Amnesty International has called for justice, not revenge, a call



that was renewed and clarified today as military attacks are



underway.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"In particular, both sides must take all necessary precautions to



protect civilians. Vulnerable groups, such as women and ethnic



minorities, must not be subject to further abuses. Captured



combatants must be treated as Prisoners of War in accordance with the



Third Geneva Convention," the human rights organization said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Amnesty International is also deeply concerned by the remarks of



Osama bin Laden that were broadcast Sunday expressing support for the



September 11 attacks. We reiterate our unreserved opposition to any



attacks on civilians whether by states or armed opposition groups,"

said Amnesty International.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to air strikes from the United States and United

Kingdom, the Afghan Northern Alliance is reported to have launched

military attacks against forces of the Taleban, with whom they have

been fighting since 1996. "Both sides have been responsible for

serious human rights abuses in the context of this conflict," Amnesty

International said. "We call on them to fully respect human rights

and international humanitarian law."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If any suspect of the crimes of Sept. 11 is captured during

military action, he should be brought to justice fairly and without

the possibility of the death penalty.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States, the United Kingdom and Afghanistan are all

parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. The Conventions,

together with their two 1977 Protocols and other international

treaties, constitute international humanitarian law, also known as

the laws of war.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All states neighboring Afghanistan should immediately open their

borders and provide protection and humanitarian assistance to Afghan

refugees with the support of the international community.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We welcome the humanitarian food drops by the U.S. government and

the commitments expressed by several countries to provide protection

and assistance to Afghans who are displaced or otherwise in need of

urgent help. However, we call on the international community at large

to intensify efforts to respond to the humanitarian emergency inside

Afghanistan and in the neighboring countries, which together already

host the largest refugee population in the world," Amnesty



International said.</font></p>
