- April 16 -  A new national Campaign unveiled its <a href="http://www.svtc.org/cleancc/e_platform.htm">Platform </a> today to

reduce health and environmental impacts from electronic products. Groups

forming the Electronics Take it Back! Campaign-- including the Silicon

Valley Toxics Coalition, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, GrassRoots

Recycling Network, Mercury Policy Project and Clean Water Action--have

developed a producer responsibility Campaign "road map" that they will

present this week at three national electronic forums in Virginia.

<p>



Discarded electronic equipment--particularly computers--is one of the

fastest growing waste streams in the industrialized world, due to growing

sales and rapid obsolescence of these products. Up until now, little

attention has been paid to the growing mountains of electronics junk and

its hazardous impacts on people and the environment.<p>



"Electronic equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals

and organic pollutants in municipal trash," said Michael Bender, a

consultant to SVTC. "Without effective recycling and phase-outs of toxic

substances, electronics junk will increasingly pollute the environment,

threatening people and wildlife."<p>

Government, industry and public interest groups are coming together to

address concerns related to the manufacture, use, storage, and disposal of

electronics at three forums:

<ul>

<li> The Electronics Products Recovery and Recycling Conference (sponsored by

the National Safety Council) will be held April 17-18;

<li> The Electronics Recycling Summit  will be held April 18 and 19th; and

<li> The National Electronics Stakeholder Dialogue will be held on April 19th.

</uL>

One of the key issues under discussion at all of the forums is the critical

need to implement responsible electronic recycling and management

programs--and to determine who will pay for them. Currently, most

"obsolete" electronic products are not recycled, and the expense of

collecting, managing and disposing of discarded electronics -- including

special collections, household hazardous waste programs and hazardous waste

site cleanup -- is usually borne by taxpayer-funded government programs,

primarily at the local level. <p>



"The Campaign is working to end the requirement that taxpayers bear

financial, environmental, and health burdens of toxic electronics waste,"

said Jeremiah Baumann, environmental health advocate for U.S. PIRG.

"Instead, we support the principle of Extended Producer

Responsibility--which means requiring manufacturers who make products with

toxic materials to take full responsibility for the products through their

entire lifecyle."<p>

The Campaign's ultimate aims are pollution prevention and waste avoidance

through a hierarchy of practices, including source reduction, reuse,

re-manufacturing and recycling. <p>



"Many companies in countries throughout Europe and Asia are implementing

extended producer responsibility programs in response to government

regulations," said Bill Sheehan of the Grassroots Recycling Network.

"Having producers assume responsibility results in internalization of

costs.  It also creates a powerful incentive to reduce such costs by

designing products that are cleaner and safer, more durable and reusable,

and easier to disassemble and recycle."
