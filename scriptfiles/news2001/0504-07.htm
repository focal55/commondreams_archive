- May 4 -  President George W.

Bush's proposal today to amend the U.S. Forest Service roadless

policy, in combination with administration moves to change

forest planning regulations, will undermine protection of more

than 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas,

according to Defenders of Wildlife.

<p>"The Bush Administration is pretending to run a straight game

by belatedly supporting protections for 58.5 million acres of

wild Forest Service lands, but in reality they are stacking the

deck against roadless forests," said Rodger Schlickeisen,

president of Defenders of Wildlife. "Today, the administration

announced plans to rewrite Forest Service policies maintaining

roadless forests, in part by leaving their fate to future forest

planning . Earlier this week, however, they overturned those

same national forest planning regulations simply because those

rules tried to ensure that activities on national forests would

not permanently harm the land."

<p>Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman today announced plans to

amend the existing U.S. Forest Service roadless-area protection

rule, issued in January 2001 after the most extensive public

rulemaking in history, encompassing more than 600 public

hearings and a record-breaking 1.6 million public comments.

Ninety-five percent of these comments supported the strongest

possible protection. This sweeping land-protection program is

the culmination of more than three years of work and public

input, and builds on more than 25 years of debate and discussion

on the subject. The rule covers 58.5 million acres of

inventoried national forest roadless areas, including those in

the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.

<p>Roadless areas provide habitat for more than 220 threatened,

endangered, and Endangered Species Act candidate species, as

well as 1,930 sensitive species. In particular, the current

roadless rule protects the last great expanse of old growth

rainforest in the United States, in the Tongass National Forest

of southeastern Alaska. It is home to ancient trees, grizzly

bears, bald eagles, and other wildlife species that thrive in

the vast and wild reaches of the forest.

<p>"As stewards of our public lands, the government should be

entrusted with protecting these last special places across

America. Instead, we are seeing a government that is willing to

sell them off lock, stock and barrel to wealthy special

interests," said Schlickeisen.

<p>In addition to the 1.5 million comments offered on the rule,

overwhelming majorities of Americans continue to favor

protection of roadless forest areas. A new national poll (April

30, 2001) by The Mellman Group shows that more than two thirds

of the voting public (67 percent) support the existing Roadless

Area Conservation Rule.

<p>Support for the rule cuts across partisan and regional lines.

Conservation groups noted that the president's actions on

roadless forests will have little if any impact on supplies of

energy or timber. The existing rule has no effect on existing

oil and gas leases, and only 0.4 percent of oil and gas is

currently produced in roadless areas. National Forests provide

only 5 percent of the nation's timber supply, and less than one

quarter of one percent comes from existing roadless areas. The

existing rule protects opportunities for a variety of

recreational activities, including hiking, camping, hunting,

off-highway vehicles and fishing.
