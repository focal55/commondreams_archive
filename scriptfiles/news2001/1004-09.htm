Executive director of the Center for Economic and Social Rights, which has recently put out

several fact sheets on Afghanistan, Normand said today: "Afghanistan was

one of the world's poorest and most devastated countries even before this

crisis. The UN has abandoned its relief operations, and all neighboring

countries have sealed their borders. More than 1 million Afghans have so far

fled their homes in panic. The $320 million aid package that Bush promised

Thursday will help the refugees. But there is also the danger that food will be

used to attract millions of desperate people to the border to serve as a proxy

army for unscrupulous opposition leaders -- part of a policy that Rumsfeld

calls 'draining the swamp.' Throughout history -- and recently in Rwanda,

Cambodia and Nicaragua -- refugee populations have been manipulated to serve

political and military ends. And what of the 20 million Afghans left behind?

Will they be condemned to starvation as part of the U.S. policy to isolate and

kill the estimated 50,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters? Will there be any TV

cameras to record their fate? With UN agency heads warning that the population

faces a 'catastrophe of stunning proportions,' it is critical that the U.S.

government live up to its rhetoric of targeting only the perpetrators of

terrorism and not civilians in general. This is not only the right thing to do,

it is our obligation under human rights and international law."

Following a meeting Wednesday in Washington, D.C., with Secretary of State Colin Powell, Qatari ruler Sheikh Hamad al-Thani acknowledged that U.S. officials had asked him to

use his influence to rein in the influential Al-Jazeera's news coverage.

Al-Jazeera is currently one of the very few media outlets still reporting from

Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan. Campagna is the program coordinator

for the Middle East and North Africa at the Committee to Protect Journalists.

He said today: "The U.S. administration is in effect calling on the Qatari

government to interfere in what has been until now an independent news station.

Over the years various Arab governments have tried to influence Al-Jazeera [<A HREF="http://www.aljazeera.net" target="_new">www.aljazeera.net</A>] -- the most

widely-watched news channel in the Arab world -- through diplomatic and other

pressures and these have gained widespread attention. We are disheartened that

U.S. officials are adopting similar tactics."

Columnist for the British <I>Observer</I> newspaper, Palast said today: "Americans should take no comfort in Blair's bomb-'em-now speech. It was given at the Labour Party

Conference, his party's convention, and he was speaking to a dark side of the

British psyche: the need to justify empire. Afghanistan broke the back of the

Soviet Empire -- and the British Empire's expansion before that. The British,

unlike the Dutch and Spanish, have never accepted their loss of imperial authority...."
