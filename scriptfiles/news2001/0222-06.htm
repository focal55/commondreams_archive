- February 22 - Hundreds of premature infants with a potentially fatal medical

condition would be given placebos -- and thus be more likely to die -- in a drug company

study in Latin America that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering

endorsing, Public Citizen has learned.

<p>In a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/hrg/publications/1558.htm">letter sent today</a>

to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tommy Thompson, Public Citizen called on the

FDA to immediately halt plans for the study unless it is redesigned to treat all patients.

</p>



<p>&quot;One expects drug companies to be profit-driven and act accordingly,&quot; said

Dr. Peter Lurie, deputy director of Public Citizen&#146;s Health Research Group. &quot;But

the FDA&#146;s job is to stop this kind of unethical behavior, not encourage or endorse

it. The fact that the agency is seriously considering this study is beyond belief.&quot;</p>



<p>In the study, hundreds of infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) would be

treated with an experimental synthetic surfactant drug called Surfaxin, while a control

group of hundreds of premature infants with the syndrome would be given placebos --

instead of one of four FDA-approved surfactant drugs that could save the infants&#146;

lives. Many infants given placebos likely would die unnecessarily, a Public Citizen

analysis shows. Surfactant is a kind of drug<b> </b>that makes it easier to inflate the

lungs of newborns with RDS.<b> </b>A third group of infants would get an already-approved

drug.</p>



<p>The study is to be conducted in one or more of the following four countries: Bolivia,

Ecuador, Peru and Mexico. The company proposing the study is Discovery Laboratories Inc.,

which is based in Doylestown, Pa., and which has licensed the drug from Johnson &amp;

Johnson. Although approved surfactants are available in some hospitals in these countries,

Discovery Laboratories plans to conduct the study in hospitals where surfactant is not

available.</p>



<p>The FDA has acknowledged in internal documents that the proposed study would be

unethical in the United States, where the new drug would be studied by treating one group

of infants with the new drug and a second group with a drug already proven to treat RDS,

but no infant would receive a placebo. One surfactant drug has been approved in the U.S.

on the basis of studies with this design, and Discovery Laboratories plans to use this

design in a European study.</p>



<p>But the FDA has long expressed a preference for studies with placebo controls, even for

conditions that are not minor, and companies prefer them because it is easier to prove

one&#146;s drug is superior to nothing than to prove that it is as effective as a

competitor&#146;s drug that is known to work.</p>



<p>Public Citizen learned about the proposed study through documents obtained from an

internal meeting at the FDA at which the proposed study was discussed. The meeting was

entitled, &quot;Use of placebo-controls in life threatening diseases: is the developing

world the answer?&quot; Because the drug is still under development, some details of the

proposed study -- such as the name of the drug company -- were not included in the FDA

documents. However, in a phone call with Public Citizen, Discovery Laboratories&#146;

president, Robert J. Capetola, confirmed that his company is the sponsor of the proposed

trial.</p>



<p>Surfactant was heralded in a 1993 New England Journal of Medicine article as

&quot;without doubt the most thoroughly studied new therapy in neonatal care.&quot; A

statistical summary of studies of synthetic surfactant has concluded that the drug reduces

neonatal mortality by 34 percent and that &quot;further placebo controlled trials of

synthetic surfactant are no longer warranted.&quot;</p>



<p>The use of a placebo in this study violates the Declaration of Helsinki, an

international ethics document.<b> </b>A recent revision to the Declaration says that,

&quot;The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested

against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods.&quot;

Public Citizen&#146;s letter notes that in light of this language, &quot;the sort of study

contemplated here is expressly forbidden&quot; by the Declaration.</p>



<p>Discovery Laboratories claims that it will make the drug available at a reduced cost in

those<b> </b>countries where it conducts the study, but it hasn&#146;t defined those costs

precisely. Pharmaceutical sales in Latin America represented just 7 percent of

international pharmaceutical sales in 1999, compared to 40 percent in North America and 27

percent in Europe. </p>



<p>&quot;The infants who would get placebos are being used by the company for reasons

having to do with corporate bottom lines in order to get their drug approved,&quot; said

Public Citizen&#146;s Health Research Group director, Sidney M. Wolfe, MD. Public Citizen

also is asking the new Office of Human Research Protections in HHS to use its influence to

immediately stop the study.</p>



<p>&quot;If this study occurs, it will be a landmark of unethical and exploitative

behavior, &quot; Lurie said. &quot;We have a profit-driven drug company turning to the

developing world to conduct studies that could never be done in the United States or even

in some parts of the study countries. This company wants to experiment on the poorest of

the poor, and that is despicable.&quot;
