- June 11 - Environmentalists support a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denial of California&#146;s request for a waiver of the gasoline oxygen requirement, saying that replacing MTBE with renewable ethanol is the best way to protect air quality and California&#146;s economy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At stake is the Clean Air Act&#146;s requirement to add oxygen to gasoline in areas with severe air pollution. In 1999, after the water-polluting fuel oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) was banned, California asked the U.S. EPA for a waiver of the federal oxygen requirement, asserting that refiners could produce cleaner-burning gasoline more cheaply without the addition of oxygen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is still a misconception that we&#146;re better off without oxygen. This is simply not what the data shows,&quot; says Elisa Lynch, Campaign Director of Bluewater Network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater Network is leading a coalition of 93 environmental, recreation and public health groups that has opposed removal of the Clean Air Act&#146;s oxygen requirement. In a report released today, Bluewater summarized their position.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The California Air Resources Board&#146;s waiver request was based on a highly questionable set of assumptions that contradicts their own modeling studies. The data clearly shows that the best way to protect California&#146;s air quality&#151;and the economy&#151;is to maintain the oxygen requirement,&quot; says Lynch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater also rejects the notion that replacing MTBE with ethanol will send California&#146;s gas prices skyrocketing. &quot;It&#146;s common sense. Removing MTBE from gasoline and not replacing it with ethanol restricts supplies, which always leads to higher prices,&quot; says Lynch. The Bluewater report cites a 1998 California Energy Commission (CEC) study that showed imports of gasoline components for non-oxygenated fuel will raise fuel prices even more than using ethanol, and a 2001 CEC report showing that substantial volumes of ethanol could be produced in-state from biomass resources, diversifying fuel supplies, and providing huge economic benefits.</font></p>
