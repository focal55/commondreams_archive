- May 9 - Americans recognize that President Bush's energy plan won't work, because

it makes the wrong choice.  We need a balanced approach that gives us

quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer energy solutions.  Thankfully,

technology gives us energy-efficient solutions that we can put in place now

to save Americans money and cut our energy use.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge isn't an answer,

and Americans know it.  Simply put, drilling the Arctic Refuge won't work.

U.S. government geologists estimate that we could only get a 6-month supply

of oil from under that fragile tundra, and the oil companies know it would

take a decade before they could produce the first drop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead of drilling under the Arctic Refuge, we can find far more oil --

and much more quickly -- by drilling under Detroit.  Not by drilling the

Great Lakes -- although that's something the Bush Administration refuses to

rule out -- but by building cars and SUVs that go farther on a gallon of

gas.  If we merely raise fuel economy standards for SUVs and other light

trucks to the same level as cars (27.5 mpg), we would save 1 million

barrels of oil per day -- three times what we might get by pillaging the

Arctic Refuge.  Raising cars and light trucks to 40 mpg would save 3

million barrels per day, more oil than we import from the Persian Gulf plus

what we could get from the Arctic and offshore California combined.

Congress adopted the CAFE standards in 1975 and hasn't changed them since.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By closing the loophole that allows SUVs, pickups and other light trucks to

guzzle gas faster than cars, we can save billions of gallons of oil -- and

billions of dollars at the gas pump.  The technology exists to build safe,

fuel-efficient cars and SUVs -- more efficient engines, better

transmissions, improved aerodynamics.  But Detroit is keeping this

technology sitting on the shelf, and will until Congress acts.  Our

colleagues at Union of Concerned Scientists estimate that for $935 in

better technology you could boost the best-selling Ford Explorer from 19

miles per gallon to 34 mpg.  That $935 investment will save drivers over

$5000 in gas during the life of their car -- and that's if gas stays at

$1.50 per gallon.  When gas prices rise, the savings soar.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Who's going to prod the automakers to make efficient vehicles?  The

American people and some visionary members of Congress.  Senators Dianne

Feinstein (D-CA), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME) and Charles

Schumer (D-NY) are leading the way with a bill (S.804) to ensure that SUVs

and other light trucks guzzle no more gas than the average car.  Even Vice

President Cheney admits that CAFE has been a success, saying: &quot;With respect

to the CAFE standards, we think they have made a significant contribution

over the years, improved the efficiency, if you will, the mileage of our

automobiles.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, automakers have begun to recognize that Americans want fuel

efficient cars and light trucks, and they're taking the first tentative

steps to putting fuel-efficient cars on the road.  Sales for Toyota's

five-seater Prius -- a gas-electric hybrid that gets 50 miles per gallon --

have exceeded Toyota's dreams.  And I have to say, as a Prius owner, I love

going for weeks without pulling into a gas station.  The Big 3 automakers

have gotten into a war of words, pledging to raise their fuel efficiency,

but those vehicles have yet to hit the road.  Ford says that in two years,

they'll begin selling a 40 mpg SUV with a hybrid engine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But rather than raising fuel economy standards, the Bush Administration is

hoping that a panel of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will keep

them from having to deal with raising CAFE standards.  That's because the

NAS panel is  anything but impartial, with former Mobil and Shell

officials, and numerous academics closely allied to the auto industry.  The

panel has not one, but two different consultants who have worked for the

auto industry and none from the environmental side.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CAFE standards are a test of sound energy policy. Detroit can make millions

of highly efficient cars that save America oil, money and pollution.  But

they won't unless Congress tells them to.</font></p>
