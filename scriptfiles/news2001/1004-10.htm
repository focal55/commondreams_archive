<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BERKELEY, CA - October 4 - "Support Bill Maher," a



grassroots, online campaign at <a href="http://www.MillionFlagMarch.com/bill/" target="_new">http://www.MillionFlagMarch.com/bill/</a>,

today delivered messages in support of Bill Maher from more than

6,000 people to executives with ABC, Sears, and FedEx. The campaign



also posted them at <a href="http://www.MillionFlagMarch.com/bill /messages/" target="_new">http://www.MillionFlagMarch.com/bill

/messages/</a>.



The messages were collected over the course of the effort's first 7

days, and several hundred more are still arriving daily.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our nation is in the midst of a crisis, and our first priorities



must be defending our country and helping the victims of the attack,"



said John Hlinko, co-founder of the campaign. "But we can't just



stand by and allow a small, shrill group to exploit this crisis to



unfairly destroy the reputation of a fellow citizen. There are too



many real enemies out there - we must not permit opportunists to

create false ones."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grassroots effort was launched on September 25, and is led by:



Hlinko, a veteran of MoveOn.org, JustSayBlow.com,



MillionFlagMarch.com, and several other online campaigns; Ann



McCormick, founder of CompassionateMoms.org; and Ray Simon, head of



MischiefMarketing.com. It came in response to the decisions of



several ABC affiliates to drop Maher's show, "Politically Incorrect,"



and of Sears and FedEx to end sponsorship of the program. Those



moves in turn came in response to a controversy in which



out-of-context remarks by Maher were misinterpreted as supporting the



terrorists involved in the September 11th attack, and denigrating the

U.S. military. (see <a href="http://www.MillionFlagMarch.com/bill/" target="_new">www.MillionFlagMarch.com/bill/</a>

for full story).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There's a belief among some that Maher was somehow praising the



terrorists, but anyone who's actually seen the episode or read the



transcript quickly sees how absurd that belief is," said Hlinko.

"Even if you're not a fan of Maher, you've got to admit that it's



incredibly unfair to punish a guy for something he didn't do. If



Sears, FedEx and the ABC affiliates choose to continue meting out



punishment that isn't deserved, that's their choice - but it'll be



our choice to respond to this unfairness by taking our business

elsewhere."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effort is not looking for donations, and instead encourages



supporters to send contributions to efforts geared towards helping



the victims of the attack (see

<a href="http://millionflagmarch.com/bill/thanks.htm" target="_new">http://millionflagmarch.com/bill/thanks.htm</a>).
