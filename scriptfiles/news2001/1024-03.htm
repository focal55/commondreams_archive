<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 24 - The non-profit Clean Air Trust today named John Graham, the 

White House Office of Management and Budget's regulatory czar, 

the clean air &quot;villain of the month&quot; for October. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Czar Graham earned this dubious distinction by launching a 

bizarre attack on a proposed EPA rule designed to require 

less-polluting recreational vehicles, including snowmobiles. It 

was the first significant air pollution control proposal issued by 

the Bush Administration -- and it isn't particularly tough -- but 

the Czar apparently felt he had to attack it on general 

anti-regulatory principles. And he showed that even the most 

fervent anti-government spokesman can spout nonsensical bureaucratic 

gobbledygook. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, a little background on the Czar: As has been widely 

reported, in his prior job he ran the industry-funded Harvard 

Center for Risk Analysis, an outfit that was paid to lend an ivy 

patina to corporate efforts to undermine various health and safety 

standards -- he was sort of a tweedy version of that poor fellow 

who runs that tiresome &quot;junk science&quot; Web site. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health and environmental groups opposed the Czar's nomination as 

director of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, but 

the business lobbyists called in their chits and got the Senate to 

confirm him. Czar Graham is wasting no time putting his unique 

stamp on the job of reviewing all federal rules. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consider, for example, his treatment of EPA's &quot;snowmobile&quot; 

proposal, which is the subject of an EPA hearing today. EPA 

proposed a modest reduction in pollution from new recreational 

vehicles because of concerns that: 1) most recreational boats spew 

huge volumes of unburned fuel into lakes and rivers; 2) 

snowmobiles, dirt bikes and off-highway motorcycles tend to stink 

up national parks as well as create shroud-like haze; 3) these 

vehicles are a significant percentage of overall pollution. 

Environmentalists have assailed the EPA proposal as far too weak. 

State air pollution regulators are also raising concerns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enter the Czar. In a recent letter to EPA, he charged that EPA 

did not evaluate the effect of its proposal on the &quot;attributes&quot; of 

engines used in recreational vehicles. &quot;We believe it is important 

to develop an estimate of the value of these attributes,&quot; wrote 

Czar Graham. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Think about that for a second. Are all attributes of equal 

value? Are there &quot;sound&quot; attributes and &quot;junk&quot; attributes? Does 

a one-size-attribute fit all? (Those interested in delving deeper 

into philosophical questions of this sort should dust off Plato's 

dialogue, Meno, and review Meno's discussion with Socrates on the 

attributes of excellence (see note a). Plato, of course, favored 

government by philosopher-kings and the Czar may well see himself 

as one of these.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Czar Graham also demanded that EPA include &quot;the loss in consumer 

surplus&quot; associated with the proposal. &quot;The consumer surplus loss 

could be large,&quot; he warns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The trouble is, we can't figure out what the heck he means by 

the term &quot;consumer surplus.&quot; Is it something like a tax refund for 

overpayment? Is it the difference between the total we owe -- and 

the monthly minimum payment -- on our Visa card? Or could it be 

what a grandmother thinks ought to be spent on the grandkids versus 

what granddad thinks they can afford? Do less affluent consumers 

have the same surplus as rich ones for the purpose of this analysis 

-- or are we talking the consumer surplus of the &quot;average man?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bottom line here is it appears that the Czar plans to make 

it difficult for an agency like EPA to issue even a mediocre rule 

-- and he'll make up a lot of jibberish if he doesn't have a real 

complaint about the rule. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

(a) Consider this sample: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meno: Let us take first the attribute of excellence in a man: he 

should know how to administer the state, and in the process to 

benefit his friends and harm his enemies. He must also be careful 

not to suffer harm himself. A woman's excellence may also be easily 

described: her duty is to order her house, and keep what is 

indoors, and obey her husband. Every age, every condition of life, 

young or old, male or female, slave or free, has a different 

attribute of excellence. There are numberless types of this 

attribute, and no lack of definitions of them. For the attribute of 

excellence is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all 

that we do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Socrates: How fortunate I am, Meno! When I ask you for one 

attribute of excellence, you present me with a swarm of them. 

Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm, and ask of you, 

What is the attribute of the bee? And you answer that there are 

many kinds of bees, and I reply: But do bees differ as bees, 

because there are many and different kinds of them; or are they not 

rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as for example 

beauty, size, or shape? How would you answer me? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meno: I guess bees do share the common attribute of being 

bees... </font></p>

<p></p>
