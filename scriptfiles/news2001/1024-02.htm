Broke the Law<br>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 24 - The Federal Election Commission has overridden its own

general counsel's findings that the 2000 Senate

campaigns of Senator Hillary Clinton, Attorney

General John Ashcroft and Senator Deborah Stabenow,

as well as the Democratic Senatorial Campaign

Committee (DSCC) and the National Republican Senatorial

Committee (NRSC), and several state political parties,

appear to have engaged in illegal schemes during the

2000 campaign to funnel soft money into their races.

The general counsel also cleared New York Mayor Rudolph

Giuliani's brief Senate campaign of any wrongdoing.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The investigation was prompted by a complaint filed in

April 2000 by Common Cause and Democracy 21.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is just one more example of the FEC Commissioners

overriding their professional staff to protect powerful

political figures and the corrupt soft money system at

the expense of enforcing the nation's campaign finance

laws. And it's just one more example of why the FEC has

to be replaced with a new effective enforcement system,&quot;

said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To reach this conclusion, the commissioners had to

ignore existing law, ignore the evidence, and ignore

their own staff.  By overturning the professionals at

the FEC, the commissioners have given a green light for

any candidate to get around the law, and shake down

corporations, labor unions and wealthy people for

unlimited contributions  - as long as they bother to

launder the money through a party committee,&quot; Common

Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Clinton's campaign claimed as precedent the

1996 Clinton-Gore ads that prompted years of

congressional and Justice Department investigation.

In each of the cases involving Clinton, Ashcroft and

Stabenow, the FEC general counsel urged the Commission

to find reason to believe that the Senate candidate's

campaign engaged in an illegal joint fundraising

scheme with its national party committee to raise

soft money and funnel it through the national party

to the state party, where it was used to buy so-called

&quot;issue ads&quot; to promote the Senate candidate's campaign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The general counsel found that these ads were in fact

campaign ads that were for the purpose of influencing

a federal election by urging support for the Senate

candidate involved. The general counsel also found

evidence of coordination between each of the Senate

candidates and their state parties that ran these ads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because these ads were campaign ads to support Senate

candidates, they could not be funded with soft money,

according to the FEC general counsel. Further, the ads

were subject to the federal limits on the amounts that

a political party could spend in coordination with its

Senate candidates. (The Supreme Court recently upheld

the constitutionality of these coordinated spending

limits in Federal Election Commission v. Colorado

Republican Federal Campaign Committee.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the political parties used soft money to pay for

the ads involved in the Clinton, Ashcroft and Stabenow

campaigns, and since the amounts spent far exceeded

the applicable limits on state party spending for

these ads, the general counsel recommended that the

Commission find reason to believe the law had been

broken and that the Commission should pursue the matter.

The Commission rejected these findings and summarily

voted to close the matter and end any investigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Clinton, Ashcroft and Stabenow campaigns each set

up so-called &quot;Victory Committees&quot; for their 2000 Senate

campaigns, which were &quot;joint fundraising&quot; committees

designed to raise soft money and were sponsored by

their Senate campaign committees and the DSCC and the

NRSC respectively.
