- May 7 - Defense industry arguments to loosen U.S. arms export controls are dealt a

blow by the figures in a General Accounting Office report obtained in

advance by the Insider.  The report, titled Export Controls: State and

Commerce Department License Review Times are Similar, invalidates the

industry's arguments that the State Department's sluggish review of arms

export licenses hampers U.S. defense firms from competing for arms sales

and cooperating with allies.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAO examined the time it takes the Departments of State and Commerce to

review and issue export licenses.  It found that the State Department spent

an average of 46 days reviewing munitions licenses during fiscal year 2000.

 By comparison, the average time for the Commerce Department, which reviews

licenses for dual-use technology, is 51 days.  Last year, Commerce employed

51 license officers to review 11,000 licenses.  State had only 23 license

officers to review 46,000 licenses.  A government source familiar with the

license review process told the Insider that State has hired a number of

license officers since the study was conducted, and that the average review

time for the first quarter for 2001 is probably even lower.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAO study undermines the central tenet of the defense industry's

argument: that the &#145;antiquated' licensing system is too slow and therefore

a threat to U.S. national security.  The industry argument contends that

licensing delays are the reason foreign defense firms and countries are

purposefully avoiding U.S. defense equipment, parts and services.  This in

turn weakens the U.S. industrial base and threatens U.S. security.  In

fact, the GAO found that two- thirds of the licenses reviewed by State took

an average of 23 days and one-third of all licences were issued within two

weeks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assertions that the sky is falling on the industry's overseas export

prospects because of licensing delays are grossly overstated.  Over the

past ten years the United States has led the world in arms sales, U.S.

allies are getting the equipment they need, and defense industrial

cooperation between the U.S. and its allies is increasing.  It is

reassuring to know the State Department is investing the necessary amount

of time to review licenses that impact U.S. national security and foreign

policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Suggestions that the U.S. government should speed up the review of

munitions licenses ignores a simple fact -- licenses that State and

Commerce review are often for  sensitive systems, parts and technologies

that can kill people.  While some licenses take over three months to

review, they are most likely for sensitive equipment or complicated arms

deals that require the input of numerous government agencies.  It should

take the government longer to review these exports than it would for a loaf

of bread. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Policy-makers should not be swayed by spurious arguments based on anecdotal

evidence from the defense industry and its vocal champions. This study

confirms that it is not time to scrap the old export control system for one

that is authored by the defense industry.
