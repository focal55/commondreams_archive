<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> September 19 -</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Date:</b>         12pm, Thursday September 20, 2001 <br>

<b>Location:</b>  Campuses across the country <br>

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

 In the Wake of Tuesday's Attacks, Students at Over 100 Colleges Campuses to Hold Teach-Ins, Vigils, and Rallies for Peace. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students and community members at 105 schools in 30 states are gathering at noon on Thursday to offer our condolences and support to the victims, their families, and all those affected by the tragic events of September 11th.  These nationally coordinated actions are meant to reaffirm the sanctity of life by seeking peace and justice in the wake of Tuesday's tragedy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students and campus groups across the country are putting forth the following principles: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; We unequivocally condemn the abominable terrorist attacks of Tuesday, September 11th. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; The nation's political leadership must seek justice rather than revenge in order to avoid the loss of more innocent lives and to work towards a lasting peace. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Americans must resist the scapegoating of people on the basis of race, religion, and nationality, especially innocent Muslim and Arab peoples in the US and abroad, and take a stand against racism and xenophobia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; The people of the U.S. and their servants in the government must guard our precious civil liberties with vigilance and not allow fear and terrorism to undermine our commitment to freedom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are hoping to stimulate a dialogue across the United States about the necessity of protecting human life around the world, the need for a reasoned and rational response to this tragedy, and the importance of long-term solutions to problems of injustice and violence. Throughout history, the voices of students and young people have been central to movements for peace and social change. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States, we are seeking to raise our voices once again.   &#147;During this time of crisis we call upon Americans everywhere to reaffirm their commitment to the principles that make Americans a great people - our respect for freedom and liberty, our embrace of tolerance and diversity, and our commitment to due process and justice,&quot; said Jerome Chavez, a student at the University of New Mexico.</font></p>

<p>  </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over a thousand students and community members from nine Boston area schools are expected to participate in noontime campus rallies that will converge in a march through Boston to Harvard Yard, while close to three thousand are expected to march and mourn on the Berkeley campus.  Students at Wesleyan, the University of Southern California, the University of Wisconsin at Madison and other colleges across the nation expect a similar outpouring of grief and support.  &quot;This horrific tragedy must never happen again.  We must rededicate ourselves to working towards true global justice both at home and abroad, as it is humanity's only hope for a lasting worldwide peace,&quot; stated Natalie Fasnacht, a student at UC Davis.  This Thursday, voices for prudence and peace are raised in unison across the nation, reminding all of Mahatma Gandhi's cautionary words, &quot;An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.&quot; Let us not lose our vision.</font></p>
