- June 16 - Greenpeace activists invaded the US embassy in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in protest against the US push to deploy a Star Wars missile system, as US President George Bush arrived for his first summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A group of five activists climbed over the 3 metre high fence and attempted to replace the US flag with a banner saying &quot;Stop Star Wars&quot;. Another 20 activists also unfurled banners saying &quot;Stop Star Wars&quot; in front of the embassy and seven of this group locked on to the gates of the embassy. The activists came from Austria, the United Kingdom and Slovakia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's summit will be an historic disaster for world peace if there is any deal struck between the US and Russia on Star Wars,&quot; said Greenpeace disarmament campaigner William Peden. &quot;Rather than enter a new era of conflict they should be building upon the work of previous Russian and American Presidents such as Bush senior, Clinton, Gorbachev and Yeltsin, who gave the world historic agreements that deeply reduced their nuclear arsenals. The legacy of Bush and Putin could well be a return to the Cold War and a new nuclear arms race, if they reach agreement on Star Wars.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Putin must continue to reject Star Wars and US demands to amend or destroy the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty which outlaws Star Wars. Putin has previously described Star Wars as a 'cure that is worse than the disease' &quot;, said Peden. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, the US and Russia are restricted to protecting only one site each from missile attack rather than their entire territory, as envisaged by Star Wars. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If Bush continues to peddle dangerous myths to justify Star Wars, he will leave Europe in no doubt that American weapons manufacturers are driving US defence and foreign policy and not the desire for global security and stability. Bush will leave Europe branded as a dangerous arms salesman and not an international statesman,&quot; said Peden. </font></p>
