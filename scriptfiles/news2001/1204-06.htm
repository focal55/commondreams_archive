National Anti-Missile System Intercept Test a Success, but Proves Little</font></div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - December 4 - Council for a Livable World congratulates the Pentagon for a successful

intercept test of the national anti-missile system, but cautions that the

test means little in proving whether hit-to-kill technology, and thus a

national anti-missile system, can actually work in realistic conditions. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To its credit, the Pentagon is now admitting as much.  &quot;We are testing to

learn, we are not testing as pass-fail for some operational reason,&quot; Lt.

Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, director of the Ballistic Missile Defense

Organization, said last week.  This cautious stance was partly due to

reports that the target missile had a radar homing beacon on it, which

guides the interceptor to within 400 yards of the target missile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This, combined with the fact that the Pentagon knows variables such as when

the target missile is launched, where it is coming from, and where it is

going to, makes these intercept entirely unrealistic.  Intercept tests,

including this one, have been canceled due to high winds or overcast skies.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Clearly, for a national anti-missile system to work, it must work around

the clock, in all kinds of weather, against sophisticated decoys, and

without the knowledge of where it will be launched and what its target is,&quot;

said John Isaacs, the Council for a Livable World's President.  &quot;Monday's

test did nothing to satisfy those criteria,&quot; he continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pentagon's second successful intercept test in a row did show that the

all the component parts of the current anti-missile system architecture

work well together, and somewhat consistently.  However, it does not show

what many anti-missile system proponents claim, that hit-to-kill technology

works in the real world, and that the U.S. should start deploying a

national anti-missile system soon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mondays' test was a small step forward, but the gap between scripted tests

and realistic tests is vast.  Only many further, more complicated tests

will show if that gap can be crossed.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
