- April 9 - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, President George W. Bush unveiled his first budget, 

signaling his administration's intent to turn its back on decades 

of progress in energy policy. Bush's Fiscal Year 2002 budget 

slashed the Department of Energy's (&quot;DOE&quot;) energy efficiency 

research programs budget by 30 percent and renewable energy 

programs by 40 percent. Some programs were eliminated altogether. 

This is at a time when the country's energy situation demands a 

fuller commitment to technologies that can be brought online 

quickly, produce new energy for the electrical grid without 

emitting greenhouse gases, provide a safe energy supply, improve 

national security by decreasing the country's reliance on foreign 

oil imports, and help stabilize the economy by creating jobs. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;To say we are disappointed by this budget is an 

understatement,&quot; said Susanna Drayne, coordinator of the 

Sustainable Energy Coalition. &quot;With soaring energy prices and an 

energy crisis that is likely to affect a broader segment of the 

country this spring and summer, the Bush budget is patently 

irresponsible. A comprehensive and balanced approach to addressing 

the nation's energy crises should include incentives to stimulate 

energy efficiency improvements as well as incentives to facilitate 

expansion of renewable energy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the deep cuts in energy efficiency and renewable 

energy research and development, the Department's budget request 

both maintains and increases funding for several expensive and 

unproductive research and development programs, such as &quot;clean 

coal&quot; and nuclear power, that support the fully mature nuclear and 

coal industries. The budget also contains an increase of over $1.5 

billion for the design and development of new nuclear weapons. The 

new Administration's appointees obviously feel that new kinds of 

nuclear weapons are more important than lower electric bills, fewer 

energy imports, and a cleaner environment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOE research, development and deployment programs conceive and 

nurture new clean energy technologies from the laboratory to useful 

application in the marketplace, which is a critical need right now. 

Consumers and businesses are facing heating bills two or three 

times higher than those last winter. California is facing an 

electricity reliability crisis that could cripple the state economy 

and spread throughout the west, with states competing with each 

other for scarce electricity. Power plants, transmissions lines, 

and natural gas pipelines are stretched to their limit in many 

states. And U.S. oil imports surged to around $120 billion last 

year. The Administration clearly should be requesting additional 

funds for energy efficiency and renewable energy at this time, not 

requesting cuts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These draconian cuts will have significant consequences for 

consumers,&quot; Drayne said. &quot;For example, energy efficiency and 

renewable energy activities that currently save consumers more than 

$30 billion a year will perish. Research and development will 

decrease for super-efficient cars, appliances, heating and cooling 

systems, windows, and lighting products. And efforts to improve 

and make renewable energy sources such as solar energy, geothermal 

generation, and wind power more affordable will be severely 

limited.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush administration's focus on building new power plants and 

drilling for more oil will not solve the nation's energy problems 

alone. &quot;Both building and drilling take years until they yield an 

energy supply,&quot; Drayne noted. &quot;Both also contribute significantly 

to the degradation of the environment. Given the nation's current 

immediate energy needs and worsening global warming, now is not the 

time to cut funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy 

programs. Nor is it the time to cut consumer and community options 

on how they can immediately address the rolling brownouts and 

electricity price spikes that are creating budget hardships.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Sustainable Energy Coalition brings together more than 30 

national business, environmental, consumer, and energy policy 

organizations. Founded in 1992, the Coalition promotes increased 

federal support for energy efficiency and renewable energy 

technologies and reduced federal support for unsafe or polluting 

energy resources. Coalition members advocate federal energy 

policies that will lead to a cleaner environment, safe reliable 

energy technologies, and a secure, prosperous future for all 

Americans. </i>
