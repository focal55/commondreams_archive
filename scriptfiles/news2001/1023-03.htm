<p>A few days after the terrorist attacks September 11, artist Mike McNeilly 

    erected a large mural entitled “9-11" with the words “God Bless America” beneath 

    the images of a New York City firefighter, an American Flag and the face of 

    the Statue of Liberty. The mural was erected on a privately owned building 

    in Westwood with the consent of the building's owner. 

  

<p>On September 21, 2001 the City of Los Angeles issued an order asking the 

    artist to remove the “9-11" mural. McNeilly refused.

  

<p>“There is no justification for such infringements on private, noncommercial 

    speech,” said Dan Tokaji, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California.

  

<p>"This is especially true when the city not only tolerates but welcomes both 

    commercial and noncommercial artworks of comparable size on other buildings,” 

    he added, citing the many lively paintings on buildings lining Sunset Blvd., 

    paintings of classical musicians next to the 110 freeway downtown, and giant-sized 

    paintings of Shaquille O'Neill and Wilt Chamberlain on a hotel near the Staples 

    Center. 

  

<p>“If there is anything that we should learn from our history,” said Tokaji, 

    “it is that the values that people are talking about these days - freedom 

    and democracy - are most in jeopardy in times of crisis. Now is a time when 

    we should be most vigilant to protect those freedoms that make this country 

    great and that unite us as Americans.”
