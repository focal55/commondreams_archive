- May 23 - The National Abortion 

Federation announced today that it will soon begin running the 

first national public service ad campaign about mifepristone, 

the FDA-approved early abortion option. &quot;Our campaign is aimed 

at ensuring that women facing an unintended pregnancy have the 

information they need to make the choice that's best for them,&quot; 

said Vicki Saporta, Executive Director of the National Abortion 

Federation (NAF). &quot;As the organization whose members have 

provided safe abortion care to women for more than 20 years, we 

are pleased to be able to educate women about this new, safe early abortion option. Our campaign will provide important 

information about mifepristone to millions of women and direct 

them to our toll-free hotline if they have questions or need a referral to a quality abortion provider.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NAF ads are scheduled to begin in July in Self and People 

magazine, and will appear in 11 additional national magazines 

through the end of the year. The $2 million campaign will reach 

more than 70 percent of women ages 18-49. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've spoken with thousands of women over the last few 

months on our toll-free hotline and know that they have a lot of 

questions about mifepristone,&quot; said Saporta. &quot;Our ad lets women 

know that mifepristone has been approved by the FDA, is safe and 

effective for early abortion, and provides them with another 

safe abortion choice. Because women want to know more about this 

option, we've also provided our toll-free hotline number 

(1-800-772-9100) and the address for our web site specifically dedicated to medical abortion (<a href="http://www.earlyoptions.org">www.earlyoptions.org</a>).&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In anticipation of an increase in calls as a result of the 

campaign, the NAF Hotline will be expanding its hours on June 

25. The hotline will operate from 8 am to 10 pm on weekdays, and 

9 am to 5 pm on both Saturday and Sunday. </font></p>
