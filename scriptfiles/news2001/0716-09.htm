- July 16 - <P><LI>ROBERT WEIL,<A HREF="mailto:RobWeil@aol.com">

RobWeil@aol.com</A> <BR>

Author of <I>Red Cat, White Cat: China and the Contradictions of "Market Socialism,"</I> Weil said today: "The new Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty signed today, though

largely economic in focus, is also a response to the strategic goals of the

Bush administration, and especially its anti-missile program. Despite its

supposed 'rogue nation' rationale, the effort to erect a shield against

intercontinental ballistic missiles is clearly directed against Russia and in

particular China, in an effort to maintain U.S. global dominance, give it a

free hand in its military actions, and attempt once again to force these two

'unfriendly' nuclear powers to bankrupt themselves trying to protect their

defensive capabilities."

Author of the just-released <I>Weapons in Space</I>, Grossman said today: "By

signaling that it will be violating the ABM treaty in a matter of months, the

Bush administration is about to shatter an array of arms control agreements and

bring the world to a time of instability and nuclear danger. The Russians have

already responded that they will put multiple warheads on their missiles. This

weekend's ABM test is an opening salvo in the U.S. move to militarize space in

violation of the intent of the Outer Space Treaty, which sets space aside for

peaceful purposes."

<P><LI>MERESO AGINA, <A HREF="mailto:kcal@africaonline.co.uk">

kcal@africaonline.co.uk</A>, <A HREF="http://www.iansa.org">www.iansa.org</A><BR>

Agina is national secretary of the Kenyan women's association Maendeleo Ya Wanawawake. She is in New York until Friday, participating in the UN Conference on the Illicit Trade

in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Agina said today: "In

the Horn of Africa, guns that pour in from neighboring countries are purchased

by paramilitary groups and criminals. These weapons are used to threaten, maim

and kill thousands of innocents each year.... The UN has the opportunity to

make a real difference in preventing these injustices but, unfortunately, the

U.S. government and a few other key governments do not appear ready to take

reasonable steps to help stop this."

<P><LI>CONMANY WESSEH, <A HREF="mailto:cede94@aol.com">

cede94@aol.com</A> <BR>

Wesseh, also participating in the UN conference, is director of the Liberian Center for

Democratic Empowerment. He said today: "Gun-running sustains bloody combat

and repression the world over, but the proliferation of small arms has been

particularly devastating in Africa. Thousands of people are being killed in

West Africa, in a senseless cycle of violence, by small arms made principally

in the U.S., China, Russia and Eastern Europe. Gun-producing countries know a

large slice of their sales are going into criminal hands."

<P><LI>LORA LUMPE, <A HREF="mailto:llumpe@mindspring.com">

llumpe@mindspring.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.nisat.org">www.nisat.org</A><BR>

Editor of <I>Running Guns: The Global Black Market in Small Arms</I>, Lumpe is

working with Amnesty International to organize a protest rally against the

small arms trade tomorrow. She said today: "By asserting the need to

protect the right of U.S. citizens to bear grenade launchers and assault

weapons -- despite the legal ban on civilian possession of such weapons -- the

U.S. 'negotiating' team is helping to ensure that butchers like the RUF in

Sierra Leone are able to get such weapons as well. The U.S. has gutted the

outcome of this historic conference.... Rather than high global

standard-setting, the result will be a weak political document that will not

require states -- most of all the United States -- to do anything to stop

gun-running and save lives.
