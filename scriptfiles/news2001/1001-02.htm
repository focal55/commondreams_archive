<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 1 -  The International Labor 

Organization (ILO) has welcomed the agreement between two members 

of the U.S. Congress and representatives of the world chocolate 

industry to eliminate child slavery on West African cocoa 

plantations and end the worst forms of child labor in the global 

cocoa-chocolate sector. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is another step forward to eradicating everywhere the 

exploitation of children in the work place,&quot; said ILO 

Director-General Juan Somavma. &quot;The ILO -- through its 

International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) 

-- and all the others involved in this new initiative is delighted 

at the outcome.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Harkin-Engel Protocol&quot;, named after Sen. Tom Harkin 

(D-Iowa) and Rep. Elliott Engel (D-N.Y.) who spearheaded talks in 

Washington with the Chocolate Manufacturers Association and the 

World Cocoa Foundation, resulted in the agreement being signed this 

week to better identify and address abusive child labor practices 

in the cocoa-growing areas of West Africa. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ILO, the International Union of Food and Allied Workers 

(IUF), the anti-slavery group &quot;Free the Slaves&quot; and the National 

Consumers League (NCL) were initial members of an advisory group 

that participated in the agreement. These non-industry, private 

sector stakeholders, together with U.S. Government officials, will 

be partners in carrying out all aspects of the Harkin-Engel 

Protocol during the next four years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Protocol provides for the development of a credible, 

mutually acceptable system of industry-wide global standards, along 

with independent monitoring and reporting, to identify and 

eliminate any use of the worst forms of child labor in the growing 

and processing of cocoa beans. The agreement also provides for 

public certification that cocoa used in chocolate or related 

products has been grown and processed without forced child labor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IPEC is also working with the U.S. Department of Labor and local 

partners to conduct community surveys to assess the extent and 

nature of child labor in cocoa growing in the Ivory Coast, said 

Tony Freeman, director of the ILO Washington Branch Office. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The cocoa projects are a welcome addition to IPEC's 

cross-border child labor trafficking program, support by the 

Department of Labor, and mark a milestone in efforts by the 

countries of the region to rid themselves of egregious forms of 

child labor in all sectors,&quot; Freeman said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ILO-IPEC aims to progressively eliminate child labor worldwide, 

emphasizing the eradication of the worst forms of abuse as quickly 

as possible. To achieve this, it is active in more than 70 

countries with programs that encourage policy reform and put in 

place concrete measures to end child labor and through 

international and national campaigns to change social attitudes and 

promote ratification and effective implementation of ILO child 

labor conventions.
