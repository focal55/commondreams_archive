- January 22 - Only days after pledging in his inaugural address to be compassionate and

to promote the virtues of unity, President George W. Bush started the first

week of his presidency with a divisive and uncompassionate act --

reinstating the global gag rule on family planning.  Reinstating the global

gag rule is no way for President Bush to fulfill his promise to be a

compassionate leader and to unite a deeply divided country.  The

anti-democratic global gag rule is out of step with the vast majority of

Americans who support family planning and want to protect the global

environment.

<p>

The global gag rule bars international family planning organizations that

receive a single dollar of U.S. funds from using their own money to talk

about abortion with their patients, provide abortion services, or lobby to

change abortion laws in their countries.  Under this rule, overseas

organizations cannot use their own revenue for these purposes.  If they do,

they may be barred from receiving U.S. humanitarian aid that goes to help

maternal mortality and child survival programs.  In reality, U.S. law has

prevented U.S. taxpayer dollars from paying for abortions overseas since

1973.

<p>

Reinstating the global gag rule will hurt women and the environment.  This

policy will ultimately impact all efforts to protect the environment.

Because rapid population growth exaserbates every environmental problem, it

is intimately linked to all our efforts to protect the environment.  The

rate at which we are consuming natural resources is jeopardizing our

planet's health and threatening the availability of water, fisheries, and

forests for our children and future generations.  For example, today more

than 500 million people face water scarcity; the world's forests have

shrunk from one third to one fifth of their original size; and we are

increasing the level of green house gases in our atmosphere every day.

<p>

By limiting access to information and services that help families to decide

the timing and spacing of their children, President Bush is making it more

difficult to protect the natural resources that are under pressure from the

demands of rapidly increasing population.  The 630,000 members of the

Sierra Club know that population and consumption pressures are critical environmental issues.  To address the core causes of these problems

effectively, we must adopt the strategy agreed to at the 1994 UN Conference

on Population and Development -- to prioritize family planning, girls

education and women's empowerment programs that encourage smaller and

healthier families.

<p>

Healthy families are good for the environment.  The Sierra Club supports

women and families and their right to information and access to family

planning and reproductive health services.  President Bush's action hurts

women who are dying every minute of every day from complications of

pregnancy.  President Bush's action to reinstate the gag rule hurts

families who are working to create a better life for their children.  And

President Bush's action hurts the environment.  By damaging family planning

groups overseas, President Bush is placing more pressure on our fragile environment.  Family planning saves women, children and our planet.

President Bush's act may satisfy a small group of extremists at the right

wing of his party, but it does not represent the will and compassion of the

American people.
