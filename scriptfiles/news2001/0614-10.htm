- June 14 - &quot;It is outrageous that 

the U.S. government is once again using its trade and foreign 

policy machinery to advance the interests of the tobacco 

merchants of death,&quot; said Robert Weissman, co-director of 

Essential Action, a Ralph-Nader founded corporate accountability 

group that works on international tobacco control issues. &quot;When 

it comes to any matter relating to tobacco, the U.S. trade 

bureaucrats' position should be: hands off.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. Trade Representative is up to its bad, old tricks, 

working on behalf of Big Tobacco,&quot; said Weissman, commenting on 

news reports that the U.S. Trade Representative has pressured 

South Korea not to raise tariffs on imported cigarettes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the face of reported diplomatic pressure from the United 

States, South Korea has backed down from plans to impose a 40 

percent tariff on foreign cigarettes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The likely result of the U.S. action will be to raise 

smoking rates in Korea, especially among women and children, 

over what they would have been. In other words, the United 

States is spreading preventable death and disease.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Reagan and Bush I administrations used trade pressure to 

force open tobacco markets in East Asia to U.S. and other 

foreign tobacco companies. The Clinton administration ceased 

using direct, bilateral pressure to open markets. By informal 

policy and later required by law (an appropriations amendment 

introduced by Representative Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and a 

last-minute executive order), the Clinton administration did not 

challenge countries' nondiscriminatory tobacco control measures. 

By informal policy, it also did not challenge discriminatory 

measures. It did, however, require China to dramatically lower 

tariffs on cigarettes as part of the U.S.-China bilateral trade 

deal, a measure condemned by Essential Action and many other 

tobacco control groups. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Numerous World Bank and other studies have shown that lowered 

cigarette tariffs not only increases the market share of foreign 

cigarettes, but boosts overall smoking rates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration should recognize that it is playing 

not only with people's lives, but with political fire,&quot; Weissman 

said. &quot;If the administration is going to use trade policy to 

advance the interests of Big Tobacco, it is likely to find a new 

constituency -- tobacco control and public health groups -- 

aggressively mobilizing in the broad coalition against fast 

track.&quot; </font></p>
