- February 26 - Friends of the Earth

(FoE) sharply criticized the Senate Republicans' energy bill today

as a gigantic payday for fossil fuel and nuclear industries, citing

$400 million in subsidies the first year that would balloon to more

than $10 billion over 10 years. The bill, introduced by Sen. Frank

Murkowski of Alaska, also targets the sensitive Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) for drilling.

<p>"This is a pollution maximization bill," said FoE president

Brent Blackwelder. "Opening the Arctic Refuge to drilling is the

most prominent outrage, but the bill is also a gravy train for the

dirtiest industries, granting huge subsidies, tax breaks and

regulatory exemptions."

<p>"This is just another blank check to add to the $2.6 billion the

fossil fuel and nuclear energy industries get from American tax

payers every year," said Blackwelder. "Fifty years and more than

$100 billion of subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power have

led us to where we are now-energy companies with windfall profits

and consumers out in the cold."

<p>FoE notes that the tax code is already riddled with special

exemptions and loopholes, citing the percentage depletion allowance

of $600 million annually intangible drilling costs for a tidy

$480 million, and a "non-conventional fuels" production credit

for $1.4 billion a year. The group says that tax subsidies for

the oil and gas industry cost about $2.6 billion each year.

<p>"The answer to the current energy crisis is the same it has

always been -- reduce our use of energy through greater efficiency

and invest in clean, renewable energy sources," said Blackwelder.
