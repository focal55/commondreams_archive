- March 1 - "This nation faces a

fundamental choice," declared Robert Borosage, co-director of

the Campaign for America's Future (CAF), speaking on Wednesday,

Feb. 28, the morning after President George W. Bush outlined his

budget and tax plans to a joint session of Congress. Borosage

was opening a Conference on the Next Agenda, which brought

together progressive leaders and activists in Washington. He

said that for the participants, the choice is clear: "Will we

use the benefits of prosperity to invest in the future, or

squander it on tax breaks that largely benefit the few?"

<p>The agenda President Bush unveiled last night is "out of step

with the times and at odds with the emerging democratic majority

of the American people," said Borosage. "The majority of

Americans did not vote to spend much of the surplus on a tax

break that goes most to the wealthiest Americans. They do not

support privatizing Social Security. They want more investment

in education and affordable health care, while preserving Social

Security and Medicare. Progressives -- the activist base of the

Democratic Party -- will lead the fight for sensible priorities.

We will make the case for strengthening families, empowering

workers, and building democracy -- and challenge an

administration agenda that threatens to repeat the mistakes of

the past decades. Now is the time for progressives to lay out

a bold alternative and take their case to the American people."

<p>At the conference, Rep. Jan Schakowsky announced plans to

join with the Campaign for America's Future in taking this

argument across the country, enlisting national legislators,

state and local leaders and activists in a new progressive

leadership organization. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney

outlined the growing popularity of the working families agenda,

and pledged to challenge the gulf between "rhetoric and reality"

of the Bush administration. Hillary Shelton, Washington

Representative of the NAACP, and Sweeney announced support for

building a new movement on voting rights across the country, to

insure that every vote counts and every vote is counted

<p>The conference highlighted three themes: (1) There is an

emerging majority for progressive reform, demonstrated by the 52

percent center-left vote won by Gore and Nader in the last

election. (2) That majority is built around an agenda based on

the concerns that families struggle with everyday -- from

educating their children, to affordable health care, to

retirement security. (3) The dynamics of the society and

economy suggest that demand for that agenda is likely to grow,

not decline. Now, speakers argued, progressives have to be much

bolder in confronting the Bush agenda and putting forth a clear

alternative.

<p>As Senator Paul Wellstone said, "It is not enough to argue

against Bush's tax breaks, we must lay out what we want and

argue our case to the American people." Wellstone warned

against spending too much energy in inside-the-beltway politics,

saying progressives had to link with the grassroots energy that

was building across the country. Wellstone and Schakowsky

called for progressives to build the infrastructure needed to

detail the agenda, enlist new leaders, recruit candidates, run

effective campaigns and build a progressive majority in the

country and in the Congress. As a resource for this effort, the

Campaign released The Next Agenda, a "handbook for

progressives," outlining elements of a progressive agenda.

<p>At the conference, Gore pollster Stan Greenberg detailed the

center-left majority that emerged in the last election. Not

only did Gore-Nader outpoll Bush by over three million votes, he

said, but Gore's central message and his stance on issues were

much more popular than he was. Large majorities favored Gore's

positions on Social Security, on how to use the surplus, on

prescription drugs and health care.

<p>Rep. Hilda Solis argued that with the changing electorate,

this emerging majority is likely to grow, not decline. America

is rapidly becoming more diverse, with Democrats benefiting as

the party of diversity. Women are working in large numbers,

with Democrats benefiting as the party for choice, pay equity,

and health care. Unions are showing an increasing capacity to

educate their members and turn out their vote.

<p>The fundamental dynamics of the economy will increase the

need and demand for more activist government, argued Jeff Faux,

president of the Economic Policy Institute. Women now work,

noted Heidi Hartmann, President of the Institute for Women's

Policy Research, creating new demands for child care, preschool,

after school programs, paid family leave, restrictions on

mandatory overtime and much more.

<p>Rep. Dennis Kucinich, head of the 52 member Progressive

Caucus, laid out the Caucus' alternative to the Bush tax plan,

a prosperity dividend that would stimulate the economy more and

cost less. He argued that as people learned about the reality

of the Bush plan, it would be defeated soundly. Rep. Jesse

Jackson Jr. called for progressives to lay out basic principles

-- that every Americans had the right to affordable, high

quality health care, and affordable high quality education --

and mobilize people around a message of hope.

<p>Afternoon sessions featured discussion of how to make

affordable health care available to all, with Senator Paul

Wellstone, Ted Marmor of Yale, and SEIU President Andy Stern.

Rep. George Miller, whom Bush dubbed "Grande Jorge" when they

met earlier this month, and NEA President Bob Chase laid out

elements of a real education agenda. Other sessions featured

presentations on the living wage campaign and pay equity for

women.

<p>In evening remarks, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney detailed

the elements of the working family agenda that represent the new

center in American politics. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois

warned that the coming struggle over direction and priorities

would not be an easy one. Bush had the bully pulpit;

Republicans control all branches of government. But, he argued,

if Democrats stand up for working people, and the make the case

for the investments vital to our future -- this is an argument

that can be won.

<p>CAF released a new book, THE NEXT AGENDA: Blueprint for a New

Progressive Movement, edited by Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey

and published by Westview Press.
