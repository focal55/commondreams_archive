- July 16 - Thirty major agencies 

involved in the fight against global AIDS today appealed to 

President Bush to use the upcoming G7 Summit to mandate deeper and 

broader debt relief for impoverished nations. The agencies sent a 

letter to Bush outlining their concerns. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This letter is yet more proof that even though the year 2000 is 

past the debt cancellation movement is going strong and making new 

allies,&quot; stated David Bryden, spokesperson for the Global AIDS 

Alliance. &quot;We hope this sends a clear message to President Bush 

that discussing AIDS at Genoa without seriously addressing debt as 

well will be rejected by a wide range of AIDS advocacy groups.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signatories included a wide range of groups including 

national religious organizations, African American groups, and AIDS 

service organitions working in Africa. The African Services 

Committee, the National Association of People Living with AIDS and 

the American Public Health Association, and Rainbow PUSH Coalition 

were among the signers. Groups providing AIDS services in Africa , 

many of them faith-based, including from Nigeria, Mali, Uganda and 

Zambia, also signed the appeal. &quot;We are concerned that your 

Administration may not yet be fully taking into account the 

tremendous potential of deeper and broader debt relief and we are 

concerned that the U.S. delegation opposed the call for deeper debt 

relief at the U.N. Special Assembly on AIDS,&quot; the letter states. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter calls for U.S. support for full cancellation of that 

portion of the debt owed by impoverished countries to the IMF and 

the World Bank. &quot;Already, some of the funds released by debt 

cancellation are being used to fight HIV/AIDS -- for example in 

Uganda, Tanzania and Cameroon. A program of deeper cancellation 

would effectively build upon these successes.&quot; The letter also 

calls for an expansion of debt relief to include Nigeria, 

Bangladesh and Haiti. . </font></p>
