- November 13 -  Mary Ellen McNish, general secretary of the American

Friends Service Committee (AFSC), an international humanitarian and social

justice organization, has returned from a visit to the Democratic Peoples

Republic of Korea (DPRK) where she observed the impact of AFSC technical

assistance on the country's recurring drought and food shortages. The trip

was taken at the invitation of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the

World's People, a quasi-governmental agency, and included representatives

from the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) which supports the program

financially.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I was impressed by the hard work and dedication of the Korean farmers and

scientists whom I met,&quot; said McNish.  &quot;They have suffered severe economic

problems, but they are finding ways to cope and branching out in new

directions.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC has been working with North Korean farmers since 1997 to improve food

production.  Assistance is going to three large farms located in the western

coastal plains, one of the major rice growing regions which feeds the

country. The three cooperatives have a combined population of about 16,500

people and farm 14,000 acres. Fertilizer contributions and other inputs from

AFSC have helped the farms raise production by about 30% compared to their

1998 yields. Due to this assistance, the farms have maintained a reasonable

level of production even in the face of adverse weather this past year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the past five years we've developed good relationships with the farm

managers,&quot; stated McNish. &quot;It's very important that we in the U.S. learn

about the day-to-day lives of ordinary people in countries which we may tend

to regard as enemies.  This is where peace is made - working together on

practical problems at the grassroots level and improving people's

livelihoods.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC has also hosted six study delegations to US universities for DPRK

agricultural researchers since 1998, including two in 2001. The subject

matter of the delegations has ranged from rice and corn breeding to improved

efficiency in animal production.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

McNish explained,  &quot;Delegations promote a people-to-people relationship, and

offer an opportunity to reach across the barriers that have kept North

Koreans and Americans apart for many decades. It's important to keep

informal channels of communication open.  The situation is complex, but the

officials with whom we met in North Korea clearly expressed a desire for

improved relations with the U.S.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assistance to the three farms for the 2000-2001 cropping season included 800

tons of fertilizer, nearly a half million square meters of clear plastic for

rice, corn and vegetable cold beds, and smaller amounts of improved seed,

herbicides, and basic equipment. AFSC has been working on the Korean

Peninsula since the 1950s when the AFSC helped South Koreans rebuild houses

destroyed by war and worked in medical projects for war refugees.  The first

AFSC delegation visited North Korea in 1980.

 

Founded in 1917 to provide conscientious objectors with an opportunity to

aid civilian victims during World War I, AFSC is grounded in Quaker beliefs

respecting the dignity and worth of every person. AFSC has programs in the

United States, and in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that

focus on issues related to economic justice, peace-building and

demilitarization, social justice, and youth.  In 1947, the AFSC and the

British Friends Service Council received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of

the Religious Society of Friends, for humanitarian service, work for

reconciliation, and the spirit in which these were carried out.  Additional

information about the American Friends Service Committee can be found on the
