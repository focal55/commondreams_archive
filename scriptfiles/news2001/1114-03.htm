- November 14 - Reacting to the decision 

taken today at the fourth ministerial meeting of the World Trade 

Organization in Doha, Qatar, to open new negotiations on fishing 

subsidies, Kathryn Fuller, president of World Wildlife Fund-U.S., 

issued the following statement: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The decision to launch WTO negotiations aimed at eliminating 

subsidies that encourage overfishing is an important advance in the 

fight to promote the health of our planet's oceans. It is a move 

that promises real benefits not only for our marine ecosystems, but 

also for people around the world who depend on fish for their 

livelihoods and their food. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The majority of the world's most valuable fisheries today are 

either overfished or fished to the limit. Misdirected government 

subsidies are among the factors responsible for this crisis. WWF 

applauds the decision taken by nearly 150 governments to craft new 

WTO rules to reduce and reform harmful fishing subsidies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's success is owed in large measure to a handful of 

governments committed to addressing the problem of harmful fishing 

subsidies. The leadership of Iceland and the United States deserves 

special mention at the head of an energetic coalition that also 

included Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Peru, and the Philippines. 

The role of the United States was critical, for it alone among the 

world's major economic powers treated fishing subsidies as a top 

priority. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The opening of negotiations on fishing subsidies also marks a 

significant step towards a better balanced and environmentally 

sensitive WTO. WTO rules and practices today are still too often 

biased against the needs of the conservation and sustainable 

development, and WWF will continue to work towards their 

substantial reform. But for the first time ever, an element of a 

major international trade negotiation will now be directed towards 

helping conserve a vital natural resource. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While there is much work ahead -- both to achieve sustainable 

fisheries and to reform the WTO -- WWF views the opening of WTO 

negotiations on fishing subsidies as an important step in the right 

direction.&quot;
