- January 30 - The U.S. Senate's confirmation of Gale Norton as

Secretary of the Interior could lead to devastation of our nation's parks

and wildlands unless Congress and the American public keep close tabs on

Norton's actions, the Sierra Club warned today.  The group said the public

outcry at her nomination demonstrates that Americans reject the extremist

views Norton has advocated, and praised the 24 Senators who voted against

her confirmation.

<p>

"Unless Congress and the public hold her feet to the fire, Gale Norton as

Interior Secretary will be a natural disaster," said Sierra Club Executive

Director Carl Pope.  "Under the heat of Senators' inquiries, Norton ducked

many questions, but she made some commitments to enforcing laws that she

had previously advocated against as a lawyer and lobbyist.  However, two

days of hearings cannot negate the decades that Norton has worked to

dismantle laws protecting our public lands.  We applaud the Senators who

voted against Norton to protect America's wildlands for our families and

for our futures."

<p>

Under questioning, Norton said she would uphold federal law stipulating that protecting endangered species can require protecting their habitat.

During her legal career, however, Norton had argued this violated the

so-called takings clause of the U.S. Constitution.  The real-world

implication of her previous position would have prohibited people from

shooting bald eagles but allowed them to cut down trees housing bald eagle

nests.

<p>

On mining, Norton acknowledged the constitutionality of the Surface Mining

Act, but ducked more specific inquiries about how she would protect the environment from damaging mines.  Norton could easily reverse an Interior

Department solicitor's opinion written during the Clinton Administration

that limited toxic waste dumps from mines on public lands to 5 acres.

Without any Congressional approval, Norton could allow mines unlimited use

of public lands to dump their cyanide-laced waste, poisoning streams and

drinking water.

<p>

"We understand that deference is paid to a President's choices, but we felt

we had a responsibility to shed light on Norton's radical record and warn

that Americans would not stand for her extremist agenda," Pope said.

"Norton's nomination is a giant reward to the oil, gas and mining

industries that funded President Bush's campaign.  This election was no mandate to pillage our public lands.  If Norton pushes policies that profit

polluters at the expense of our clean water and spectacular lands,

Americans will howl in protest and Congress will stop her dead in her

tracks."

<p>

In comparison to the vote against Norton today, just 12 Senators voted

against the 1981 nomination of Norton's mentor, James Watt, who was later

ousted as Interior Secretary due to his extremist agenda.

<p>

Through local press conferences in over a dozen states, email campaigns,

phonebanks, volunteer mobilizing, radio and television advertising, and other grassroots actions, the Sierra Club educated Americans about Norton's

anti-environmental positions and raised questions about her qualifications

for Interior Secretary.
