- January 5 - President Clinton today

included Alaska's Tongass in the Forest Service's Roadless Protection

Plan. The plan offers substantial protection for 58.5 million acres

of roadless wilderness in national forests across the nation.

Alaska's Tongass contains the world's largest intact temperate

rainforest tracts. It had initially been exempted from the policy

that would have allowed continued road building and large-scale

commercial logging of its roadless, old growth, forest tracts.

<p>"By immediately protecting Alaska's Tongass Rainforest, President

Clinton has assured future generations the opportunity to experience

the grandeur of this magnificent forest," stated Marty Hayden of

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. "These wild areas protected by

President Clinton are a living legacy of ancient forests and their

wildlife that have been decimated elsewhere in the nation, if not the

world."

<p>Brian McNitt, of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign, praised Clinton's

action as a "bold initiative" that validated the most extensive

public comment process ever held by the Forest Service on a rule

making procedure. "Over a million people submitted comments in

support of the Tongass nationwide and over 62 percent of the Alaskans

testifying wanted the Tongass roadless areas protected," stated

McNitt.

<p>Pat Veesart, of the Sitka Conservation Society reports that in

Southeast Alaska, the heart of the Tongass, nearly 75 percent of

people who testified in the four largest cities supported its

inclusion. Veesart noted that this is an opportune time to extend

protection of the old growth forest, "...current low timber cut

levels in the Tongass mean that it can be included right now without

major economic dislocation."

<p>"We have long advocated for the permanent protection of important

roadless wildlands on the Tongass and this administrative decision

is

an excellent first step in that direction," said Katya Kirsch, of the

Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, a coalition of Southeast

Alaska conservation organizations.
