- June 6 -  In a press conference

today, Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law

and Policy (CRLP) announced that CRLP is suing President George W.

Bush for censoring the speech of Americans under the Global Gag

Rule. CRLP v. Bush is the first lawsuit focusing on the

limitations on free speech promoting abortion law reform under

President Bush's Global Gag Rule.

<p>"President Bush took away my right to speak because I support a

position with which he disagrees: that access to safe and legal

abortion is a human right of women worldwide," said Benshoof.

"The Global Gag Rule is global censorship that violates fairness,

freedom, and democracy."

<p>The Global Gag Rule bars foreign organizations that receive U.S.

aid from using their own money to speak freely about abortion law

reform. Without access to gagged foreign organizations and their

information, CRLP's lawyers cannot effectively communicate with

citizens and activists in other countries, influence governments,

or assist in abortion law reform.

<p>Groups like CRLP and its foreign partners that support abortion

rights are gagged, even in nations where abortion is legal, while

organizations working to criminalize abortion or to increase

restrictions on abortion access are not censored by the U.S.

government.

<p>Human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the

Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, have joined CRLP's lawsuit

against President Bush. Human rights leaders recognize that

without free speech, it is impossible for U.S.-based groups to open

the world's eyes to the horror of human rights abuses, whether

political torture, landmines, or unsafe abortion, which claims the

lives of 213 women every day worldwide.

<p>"Since founding CRLP nearly ten years ago, I have been at the

forefront of the global dialogue about women's right to equality

and women's rights to control their reproductive destinies. During

this time, only one nation has censored my speech: the U.S. Not the

Taliban. Not the Chinese. Only President Bush has censored my

speech," said Benshoof.

<p><i>CRLP is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting women's

equality worldwide by guaranteeing reproductive rights as human

rights. For more information about CRLP v. Bush or the Global Gag

Rule, visit <a href="http://www.crlp.org">www.crlp.org</a>.
