- September 24 - The members and staff of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), made up of 275 Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish institutional investors, share the deep sense of grief and pain of citizens throughout our nation and the world in the wake of the tragic loss of innocent lives caused by the brutal attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania. These were attacks on all people around the world who affirm the dignity and sanctity of human life.  We recognize again our own vulnerability and our interdependence in the human community. Our prayers enfold the victims and their families in this time of massive trauma.  We seek God's guidance, comfort and love to cope with the loss of life.  Each life is precious in God's sight. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are an organization devoted to corporate social responsibility.  Our ICCR members and staff have developed relationships with many persons working in companies that were housed in the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings.  We express our profound sympathy to the families of those who have died and offer our solidarity to the companies that are trying to re-establish their operations beyond the destruction.  We recognize that many other companies have been affected by this tragedy as well. The members and staff of ICCR offer our prayers, our support and our counsel as families and communities seek to come to terms with the devastating impact of the catastrophe. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe that we have all been diminished by this tragedy.  In the midst of our mourning, we urge a course of action built on justice, not vengeance.  War is not the answer to violence and terrorism.  The United States should act in cooperation with the international community to bring those responsible to justice under the rule of law.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the American people to resist ascribing guilt to any group or faith because of the actions of specific individuals.  We are especially concerned about our Muslim colleagues and our brothers and sisters in the Arab community.  Our faiths call us to identify with the victims, to support their families and to address the injustices upon which terrorism grows.  We affirm God's way of peace, justice and reconciliation in the days and months ahead. </font></p>
