<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>* Fast Track</b></font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SARAH ANDERSON, <a href="mailto:saraha@igc.org">saraha@igc.org</a>, <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org" target="_new">http://www.ips-dc.org</a><br>

Director of the Global Economy Project of the Institute for Policy Studies, 

Anderson said today: &quot;As they pressure Congress to vote as soon as possible 

on a controversial bill to renew trade promotion authority, also known as 

'fast track,' Bush administration officials are arguing that America needs 

more free trade to fight Bin Laden. Robert Zoellick, U.S. Trade 

Representative, argues that there is an 'inextricable link' between 

economic prosperity and global security. But fast track is not the right 

approach to achieving global prosperity. U.S. forcefulness in trade 

negotiations has resulted in trade deals that primarily benefit large 

corporations, and the current fast track proposal would virtually ensure 

more of the same. In Latin America alone, the Inter-American Development 

Bank reports that any gains in terms of economic growth were wiped out by 

rising inequality during the past decade, a period of rapid trade and 

investment liberalization.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREG PALAST, <a href="mailto:gregory.palast@guardian.co.uk">gregory.palast@guardian.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.GregoryPalast.com" target="_new">http://www.GregoryPalast.com</a>, <br>

An economist and author of the book &quot;Democratic Regulation,&quot; Palast 

recently wrote the article &quot;The WTO's Hidden Agenda.&quot; He said today: &quot;The 

WTO is not an instrument of free trade, it is the institutionalization of 

unfair and imbalanced trade. Former chief economist of the World Bank and 

Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz likens free trade by the rules of the WTO 

and World Bank to the Opium Wars. 'That too was about opening markets,' he 

said to me in a recent interview. As in the 19th century, Europeans and 

Americans today are kicking down the barriers to sales in Asia, Latin 

America, and Africa, while barricading our own markets against Third World 

agriculture and textile goods. In the Opium Wars, the West used military 

blockades to force open markets for unbalanced trade. Today, this is done 

through a financial blockade, which is just as effective and sometimes just 

as deadly.&quot;</font></p>

working to ensure that developing countries can produce generic AIDS drugs. 

Russell is in Doha, Qatar for the WTO summit.</font></p>

An independent labor analyst, Bacon is author of the recent article &quot;Fast 

Track Legislation Comes Back from the Dead.&quot; He said today: &quot;Labor 

standards don't even seem to be an issue in Doha.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DAVID WASKOW, <a href="mailto:dwaskow@foe.org">dwaskow@foe.org</a>, <a href="http://www.foei.org/campaigns/TES/WTO/doha.htm" target="_new">http://www.foei.org/campaigns/TES/WTO/doha.htm</a><br>

Trade and international policy coordinator for Friends of the Earth, Waskow 

said today: &quot;At the beginning of the meeting, WTO Director-General Mike 

Moore stated that 'We have learned a lot out of Seattle.' Unfortunately, we 

are once again witnessing misleading and exclusionary negotiating tactics. 

If the European Union, the U.S. and Japan have their way, a huge range of 

new sectors will come under WTO rules, meaning greater rights for 

Northern-based transnationals, but possibly little else for poorer 

countries and people, smaller companies and the environment. These policies 

lead to the continued marginalization of many developing countries. The WTO 

is failing to address the concerns raised by poor countries and civil 

society...&quot;</font></p>
