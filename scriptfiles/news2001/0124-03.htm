- January 24 -  The Sierra Club today expressed disappointment that the

U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted to confirm Gale

Norton as Secretary of the Interior, but praised Senators Charles Schumer

(D-NY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) for opposing her nomination.

<p>

Under tough questioning by Schumer, Wyden and other Senators, Norton

disavowed some of her extremist positions, but the Sierra Club continues to

believe Norton will not be an adequate steward of America's public lands

and urges the full Senate to reject her nomination.

<p>

"Two days of hearings cannot negate the decades Norton's worked to

undermine environmental protections," said Carl Pope, executive director of

the Sierra Club.

<p>

"After a career spent trying to dismantle laws protecting our National

Parks, streams and wildlife, we're skeptical about Norton's sudden u-turn

on these issues," Pope said.  "Senators extracted from Norton a pledge to

uphold the laws safeguarding our public lands, but we believe a lifetime of

actions speak louder than two days of words. Norton has worked for decades

as a lobbyist and lawyer for extractive and polluting industries."

<p>

Pope added: "We understand that deference is paid to a President's

nominations, but Senators also have a duty to withhold their consent when a

pick espouses views far from those held by mainstream Americans.  We

applaud Senators Schumer and Wyden for saying no to Norton's extremism."

<p>

Through local press conferences in over a dozen states, email campaigns,

phonebanks, volunteer mobilizing, radio and television advertising, and other grassroots actions, the Sierra Club has educated Americans about Gale

Norton's anti-environmental extremist positions and raised serious

questions about her qualifications for Interior Secretary.
