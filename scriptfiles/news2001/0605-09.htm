- June 5 - <i>&quot;Reports of the death of the estate tax have been greatly 

exaggerated. The decision to postpone its execution for nine years 

gives common sense plenty of time to prevail over the hazards of 

wholesale repeal, which would widen the already vast wealth gap.&quot;</i> 

-- Chuck Collins, co-founder of Responsible Wealth </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush won a primarily symbolic victory with the tax cut 

bill he will sign Thursday, according to opponents of estate tax 

repeal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill is so full of hidden costs, accounting tricks, delays 

and sunset provisions that it surely will not become permanent law 

in its entirety, according to Chuck Collins. The question remains 

which parts will be implemented, the much-needed breaks for working 

families or the irresponsible giveaways to the very wealthy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax repeal doesn't go into effect until 2010, and 

applies only to those who die in the year 2010. In 2011, a sunset 

provision returns the estate tax to current law, which specifies a 

$1 million exemption starting in 2006. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Gates, Sr., co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates 

Foundation and lead signer of Responsible Wealth's Call to Preserve 

the Estate Tax, says, &quot;This gradual reform of the estate tax over 

the next few years -- a $1 million exemption in 2002, $2 million in 

2006 -- is just what we have been advocating instead of complete 

repeal. We feel we won a partial victory in delaying full repeal.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hypocrisy with which repeal proponents used small businesses 

to hide their true agenda of more riches for the super-rich is now 

obvious, as the final bill eliminates in 2004 the higher exemption 

for family-owned business. Small business owner Martin Rothenberg 

says, &quot;This bait-and-switch tactic shows that we small business 

owners were nothing but a smokescreen. There are many ways the 

government can support family businesses, and estate tax repeal 

isn't one of them. I don't resent being asked to give back to the 

public coffers when I die.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gary Bass, Executive Director of OMB Watch and chair of the 

nonprofit coalition against estate tax repeal, says, &quot;The American 

people are catching on to all the tricks and booby traps in this 

bill. We are confident that nine years from now, the &quot;death tax&quot; 

myths will give way to responsible concern for federal and state 

revenue and charitable giving.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collins adds, &quot;In 4 short months, Responsible Wealth organized 

1,000 wealthy people to preserve the estate tax and, with OMB 

Watch, formed a coalition of hundreds of groups opposed to repeal. 

With a 10-year lead time, imagine how much opposition we could 

mount!&quot;
