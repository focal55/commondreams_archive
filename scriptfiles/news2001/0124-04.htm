- January 24 -   The first lawsuit against the city of Philadelphia over

arrests during the Republican National Convention (RNC) was filed earlier

this week in federal court.  Michael Graves, the owner of the warehouse

used to make puppets, signs, and banners, charges that he was wrongfully

arrested, detained and prosecuted, and his property was seized and

destroyed in violation of constitutional rights.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">R2K Lawyers Paul Messing and David Rudovsky filed suit Monday in U.S.

District Court for unspecified damages on behalf of Michael Graves and his

wife, Susan Ciccantelli.  The civil suit complaint outlines that the city

of Philadelphia subjected Graves to &#147;false arrest, lengthy pre-arraignment

detention and malicious prosecution . . .  to chill the exercise of

protected First Amendment activity and to detain suspected protesters for

the duration of the RNC.&#148;  Graves and Ciccantelli leased their West

Philadelphia space to activists in order to create messages of dissent to

be used during the RNC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philadelphia Mayor John Street, Police Commissioner John Timoney, and

Deputy Commissioner Robert Mitchell are all named as defendants in the

lawsuit.  Graves claims that the city engaged in &#147;preventive detention&#148; to

hold protesters in jail for the duration of the Convention, violating their

First Amendment rights.  In addition, Graves contends that the four-day

pre-arraignment detention and malicious prosecution were violations of his

Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Graves was originally arrested on August 1st, 2000 in the warehouse with

seventy-five others and charged with crimes of possessing instruments of

crime, recklessly endangering another person, obstructing justice,

conspiracy to obstruct justice, disorderly conduct and related offenses.

Nearly four months later, on November 29th, the District Attorney&#146;s office

withdrew all charges against Graves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Graves comments on his unlawful arrest and time in the holding facility

known as the &#147;roundhouse&#148; saying that &#147;when they figured it out, they

should have let me go immediately instead of keeping me down there.

[Instead] I had to spend thousands of dollars and had to go through all

this aggravation, and they finally dropped the charges.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit also states that, &#147;at no time did [Graves] commit any illegal

acts or engage in any conduct which justified the actions of the [city and

police].&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the over 300 cases already resolved, only thirteen cases have resulted

in convictions, highlighting the overreaction by the city of Philadelphia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although this is the first suit of its kind, the R2K Legal Collective

confirms that many more civil suits will be filed in the near future.  A

suit filed by volunteer medics, claiming harassment by law enforcement, is

the only other civil suit so far arising out of last year&#146;s Republican

Convention.</font></p>
