- March 7 -  Ralph Nader today urged

the Senate to defeat efforts to weaken consumer bankruptcy

protections and, instead turn its attention to ending "pernicious

credit practices that are taking billions of dollars annually from

working citizens"

<p>"At the same time that the banks and other credit card issuers

are sending lobbyists to Capitol Hill to gut consumer bankruptcy

protections, the issuers are sharply increasing their direct

marketing of cards and expanding credit lines to already

overextended consumers," Nader said. "These lenders have not come

to Congress with clean hands asking that the consumers they have

lured into excessive debt be blocked from access to bankruptcy

protections."

<p>Nader said Congress has long been aware of sleazy lending

practices and excessive fees by credit merchants. He said Congress

has looked the other way and "provided no barriers to the financial

institutions assault on consumers."

<p>"Now, the financial industry-having milked so many consumers dry

through high interest rates, fees and sleazy underhanded

tactics-wants Congress to squeeze their victims further through

punitive amendments to the Bankruptcy Code," Nader said. "Congress

should be ashamed to even take up such a bill, much less enact it

into law."
