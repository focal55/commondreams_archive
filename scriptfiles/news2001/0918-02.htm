- September 14 -  The Green Party of the United States urges President Bush and other U.S. leaders to continue condemning the harassment and blame of Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. or around the world in the wake of the terrible events of September 11. &quot;Our message is that, in our grief, we must not lash out at innocent people,&quot; said Anita Rios, a member of the party's national steering committee and an Ohio Green.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Arabs and Muslims are among the many thousands of people who have joined the heroic rescue, medical, and relief efforts,&quot; said Dean Myerson, of Colorado, political coordinator for the Green Party.  &quot;Almost certainly, some were among the victims of the attacks.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greens have sharply criticized Mayor Giuliani's policies in the past, but we thank him for speaking so early and forcefully against the harassment, which, unfortunately, seems to be increasing. President Bush and other elected officials must assert that it will not be tolerated.&quot; Greens also praised the strong warning delivered on Monday by FBI chief Robert S. Mueller against hate crimes leveled at Arabs and Muslims.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Violence begets violence and hate begets hate.  If we allow this hate crime to inspire others crimes of hate, the criminals who perpetrated the attacks will have won,&quot; stated Jane Hunter, Communications Chair of the Green Party of New Jersey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Groups like the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) and Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee have expressed condemnation of the attacks and sympathy for the victims. Greens join American Muslims and Arabs in condemning &quot;the irresponsible reporting that twists the realities and complexities of the Muslim world in order to project only anti-American sentiment&quot; and &quot;warning against opportunists who will exploit

the misery and hysteria of the public in order to promote a political agenda aimed at tarnishing the name of Islam and Muslims&quot; (MPAC briefing, Tuesday, September 11, 2001). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International Center of Bethlehem &lt;http://www.annadwa.org&gt; reminds us that, despite some recent media images, most Palestinians, including President Yasser Arafat, and Palestinian organizations have deplored the attacks and expressed sympathy for the victims and for Americans. Muslim commentators have

stressed that Islam is a religion of peace and that last Tuesday's attackers are a tiny minority of radicals who do not represent Muslims around the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are sickened at how Arabs and Muslims are being scapegoated and are targets for violent and hateful attacks&quot; said Starlene Rankin, Illinois Green Party Media Coordinator. &quot;We encourage Americans to participate in the many community forums being organized by Greens and other progressive groups around the country. We need to grieve and vent and discuss the real consequences of the use of violence to solve problems.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These were acts of terrorism,&quot; added Dean Myerson, &quot;but they should not be an occasion to mistreat people because of ethnicity, nationality, or religion, or for violations of international law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party, which proudly ran the first Arab-American candidate for President of the United States bears a special obligation to denounce this kind of prejudice.&quot; Ralph Nader is the child of Lebanese immigrants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, the Green Party of the United States notes that many Greens from the New York City metropolitan area may have lost loved ones, friends, and co-workers in the destruction of the World Trade Center, and expresses sympathy and condolence for them along with all others who have been affected by Tuesday's attacks. The party honors Greens and their supporters everywhere who have assisted the rescue and medical efforts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is personal,&quot; said one Green Party member who lives in New York.</font></p>
