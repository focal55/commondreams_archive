- July 11 - Just days before it launches another test of the snafu-plagued missile

defense system from California and the Marshall Islands, the Bush

Administration is making some devious missile defense moves in a totally

different direction: Alaska.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's latest plan, provided to the media and Congressional

staff in recent days, is to build a new missile defense test facility at

Fort Greely, Alaska that would be used to store interceptor missiles that

would be test-launched from Kodiak Island.  However, this testing facility

could easily be upgraded to a bare-bones missile defense system as early as

2004, and is in fact exactly the same site that the Pentagon has marked for

the initial deployment of a national anti-missile system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Administration's plan is too clever by half,&quot;  said John Isaacs of the

Council for a Livable World. &quot;This is a classic &quot;camel's nose under the

tent&quot; to start the money flowing without having to show that the system

will work. But they're not fooling anyone.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The move also allows the Administration to begin walking away from the 1972

ABM Treaty, which President Bush and other officials have ridiculed as a

&quot;relic.&quot; The treaty prohibits deploying a missile defense system anywhere

but at a single approved site &#151; North Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Administration is making a virtue out of obfuscation,&quot; said Chris

Madison, director of the missile defense campaign at the Council for a

Livable World Education Fund. &quot;Are they testing or deploying? Are they

violating the ABM Treaty or not? We simply don't know on either count, and

that's the way they seem to want it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration recently submitted to Congress a revised FY2002 Defense

Department budget that includes $8.3 billion in spending for missile

defense, a 57 % increase over 2001 levels. Much of the increase is for more

robust research and development on this proposed system, that still does

not work.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The whole question of missile defense is too important to be accomplished

through sleight of hand,&quot; said Isaacs. &quot;It is foolhardy to break the ABM

Treaty that has helped prevent nuclear war for a generation, particularly

with a system that has not been shown to work. That is still some years

away.&quot;  </font></p>
