- January 15 - The following was

released today by Friends of the Earth:

<br>

&nbsp;

<p>January 11, 2001

<p>The Honorable Jeff Bingaman

<br>Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources

<br>703 Hart Senate Office Building

<br>Washington, D.C. 20510

<p>Dear Senator Bingaman:

<p>On behalf of the thousands of members of Friends of the Earth,

I would like to formally express this organization's opposition to

the nomination of former Senator Spencer Abraham as Secretary of

the United States Department of Energy (DOE). As a United States

Senator for the state of Michigan, Spencer Abraham has a record of

defending polluting, resource extractive energy sources over

renewable energy.

<p>Growing bodies of evidence demonstrating the impacts of global

warming and current energy crises throughout the country emphasize

the importance of sound energy conservation strategies. The U.S.

is at a crossroads in terms of its national energy policy: will

there be a substantial move towards sustainable and renewable

energy sources, or will we continue to rely on fossil fuels at the

expense of our air, water, and natural resources? In light of his

record, Senator Abraham's nomination would be a step in the wrong

direction.

<p>Senator Abraham's abysmal record on energy issues includes:

<p>-- Voting to block consideration of an amendment that would have

increased spending on the DOE's Solar and Renewable Energy program

by $62 million, bringing it within range of the Administration's

FY00 budget request (Roll Call Vote No. 171, June 16, 1999).

This policy stance is in direct conflict with President-elect

Bush's own Comprehensive National Energy Policy, which states that

Bush "understands the promise of renewable energy and believes

strongly in encouraging alternative fuel sources such as wind,

biomass, and solar."

<p>-- Voting against a resolution calling for an end to the freeze

on Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards (Roll Call Vote

No. 275, September 15, 1999). Currently, emissions from U.S. cars

and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) contribute 20 percent of U.S.

global warming pollution in the form of carbon dioxide. Improving

the vehicle mileage per gallon of cars and SUVs by raising CAFE

standards would reduce the amount of fossil fuels burned, saving

gas and preventing further pollution.

<p>-- Consistently siding with the oil industry and voting to open

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to oil

drilling (most recently: Roll Call Vote No. 058, April 6, 2000).

ANWR is a 19 million-acre wildlife refuge of unequaled beauty and

importance to the arctic and subarctic ecosystems of that region.

It is home to hundreds of animal species and million of migratory

birds. It serves as a polar bear denning habitat and is the

primary calving grounds for the Porcupine caribou herd, long a

cultural treasure for the native Gwich'in people of Alaska and

Canada. To allow oil drilling in this area when alternative fuel

sources exist would be to senselessly destroy one of our nation's

priceless natural treasures.

<p>-- Protecting the mining industry from efforts to enact

environmental safeguards and bonding requirements for hardrock

mines on public lands (most recently: Roll Call Vote No. 224, July

20, 2000). In addition, Senator Abraham voted to legalize

unlimited mine waste dumping on public lands by eliminating the

"millsite claim" provision from the Mining Law of 1872 (Roll Call

Vote No. 223 July 27, 1999).

<p>-- Defending the coal industry by supporting efforts to exempt

hardrock mining operations from the Clean Water Act and the Surface

Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Roll Call Vote No. 370,

November 18, 1999).

<p>-- One of three cosponsors of a bill to abolish the Department

of Energy (see: S. 896, the Department of Energy Abolishment Act in

the 106th Congress).

<p>Given Senator Abraham's position on renewable energy and his

unfettered defense of resource extractive industries, ratifying his

nomination as Secretary of United States Department of Energy would

be a grave mistake for the direction of our nation's energy policy.

Friends of the Earth therefore urges you to oppose his nomination.

&nbsp;

<p>Sincerely,

<br>&nbsp;

<p>Brent Blackwelder

<br>President

<br>Friends of the Earth
