- December 19 - As stunned as we are by the horrific acts of September

11, in the midst of heartfelt grief, anger, and fear there are those among

us who believe that a call to war will do little to stop the tide of despair

and hopelessness from which terrorism feeds.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we turn to thoughts of peace on earth this holiday season, here are 10

things you can do to support a call for justice, not war, vengeance or

retaliation:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		1. CALL OR WRITE YOUR CONGRESSPERSON and tell them how you

feel.   Encourage them to support peace not war and encourage them to seek

diplomatic international solutions not vengeance or retaliation. Support US

political leaders -- such as Barbara Lee, US Representative from California

-- who are calling for nonmilitary alternatives war and violence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		2. VOICE YOUR OPINION. Write letters to the editor in your

local paper. You 

		can use the AFSC media guide (www.afsc.org) to send e-mail

to local or national 

		media. Call radio talk shows and attend public forums. If

you participate in 

		opinion polls, be sure to suggest diplomacy or peace as an

option, since this 

		category is usually not available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		3. Young children NEED AN OUTLET TOO. Youngsters can draw

pictures to express their feelings, if they are too small to write. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		4. ATTEND PUBLIC EVENTS.  Organize a vigil for peace with

faith-based or 

		other groups in your community. Visit www.peaceresponse.org

to learn about 

		events near you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		5.  LEARN ALL YOU CAN about the Islamic faith, particularly

Islam's positive 

		stand on peace and nonviolence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		6. WORK AGAINST VIOLENCE aimed at others because of race,

color, creed, ethnicity, religion, nation of origin, gender or sexual

orientation. Make a special point to reach out a hand of support to anyone

who is perceived as Muslim or Arab. Contact a local mosque or civic

organization to express your support and identify ways you can help.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		7. LEARN ABOUT THOSE COUNTRIES that the US government holds

accountable for terrorist acts. Knowing the history, the geography, the

accomplishments, and problems facing countries like Pakistan or Afghanistan

will help us let others see the peaceful majorities that live in these

countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		8. HOLD THE MEDIA ACCOUNTABLE for biased reporting. Don't

hesitate to call a local media outlet if you see evidence of unfair or

slanted reporting. Be sure to watch and read a variety of media sources and

include foreign press in your assortment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">		9.  INSIST ON MAINTAINING AND PROTECTING THE CIVIL LIBERTIES

that citizens in the United States have worked so hard to create; you have

the right to speak freely, to associate freely, to assemble in lawful groups

to express opinions, and, at the same time, you have the right to privacy.

Working in your communities to use and protect these rights in the weeks

ahead will guarantee that terrorism has not destroyed the fabric of liberty

or undercut our Constitution. True patriotism upholds the founding

principles of our country and embraces the Bill of Rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	10. EDUCATE YOURSELF ON ALTERNATIVES TO WAR. Order a copy of The

Little Book of Peace, by Patricia J. Chui, which contains anecdotes from

well-known promoters of peace including Buddha, Martin Luther King, Jr. and

Mahandas Gandhi, as well as quotes from individuals who may not be as well

recognized for their nonviolent insight, such as: Jimmy Carter, Eleanor

Roosevelt and Malcolm X. Also available: Speak Truth to Power, a study of

international conflict that represents a Quaker search for alternatives to

violence. Its message is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was

first published in 1955.  Both publications are available from the AFSC

Literature Resources Unit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFSC No More Victims campaign is designed to highlight peace and promote

peaceful solutions in aftermath of the September 11 tragedies, in an attempt

to break the cycle of violence and retribution. For more information or to

make a contribution, access the AFSC web site at <a href="http://www.afsc.org" target="_new">www.afsc.org</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1917 to provide conscientious objectors with an opportunity to

aid civilian victims during World War I, AFSC is grounded in Quaker beliefs

respecting the dignity and worth of every person. AFSC has programs in the

United States, and in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that

focus on issues related to economic justice, peace-building and

demilitarization, social justice, and youth.  In 1947, the AFSC and the

British Friends Service Council received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of

the Religious Society of Friends for humanitarian service and work for

reconciliation during World Wars I and II, and the spirit in which these

were carried out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) has published a new report

entitled After September 11: Standing on the Brink of a Brave New World that

explores the new challenges to basic principles of democracy and  civil

liberties in the aftermath of September 11.  To order an AFSC publication,

contact our Literature Resources Unit, at 1-888-588-2372, extension 2.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that

includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace

and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of

every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and

injustice.</i></font></p>
