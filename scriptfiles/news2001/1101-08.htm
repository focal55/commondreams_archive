<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 1 - The Sierra Club today welcomed Senator Tom Harkin's (D-IA)

proposal as a major improvement over the House version of the farm bill and

current law.  Senator Harkin's bill would provide more money to help

farmers safeguard clean water, protect wetlands, and prevent suburban

sprawl.  Senator Harkin's legislation would increase funding for

conservation programs that the House Farm Bill sorely neglected and would

hold corporate factory farms responsible for their pollution.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The House turned its back on family farms and clean water but we are

grateful that Senator Harkin is working to protect them,&quot;  said Ed Hopkins,

Director of the Sierra Club's Environmental Quality Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Harkin's bill would increase wetlands protected by the Wetlands

Reserve Program to 250,000 acres per year, 100,000 acres per year more than

the House-passed bill.  Wetlands act as a filter to clean polluted water,

protect against flooding and provide wildlife habitat.  Senator Harkin's

proposal would increase funding to protect farmland from suburban sprawl,

boosting it to $250 million annually by the end of the five-year period.

The House bill authorizes only $50 million per year.  In addition, the bill

incorporates a new provision, the Conservation Security Act, which rewards

farmers who protect water, air, soil and wildlife.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Harkin's bill also makes major improvements over the House's

provision concerning animal waste.  Manure runoff from fields and leaky

storage pits is a major source of water pollution. The House bill would

provide potentially billions of dollars in federal subsidies to large,

industrial-scale livestock operations controlled by major corporations.  In

contrast, Senator Harkin's bill dedicates this money to smaller,

family-sized livestock farmers, to help them stop pollution by building

manure management systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Taxpayers do not and should not pay auto factories, chemical manufacturers

and other businesses to comply with the Clean Water Act, and we should not

subsidize industrial livestock operations to obey the law either,&quot; Hopkins

said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shifting funds away from supporting overproduction of commodities and

toward meeting conservation needs would benefit the environment and improve

the health of the agricultural economy.  Although this bill makes

improvements over current law and the House Farm Bill, it continues to

subsidize overproduction of commodities, which limits conservation funding.

More money is still needed for conservation programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge the Senate to help farmers take fragile land out of production,

create buffer strips and take other steps to protect clean water and set

aside areas for wildlife habitat,&quot; continued Hopkins.  &quot;Many farmers want

to participate in voluntary conservation programs but simply can't afford

to do so.&quot;
