- August 22 - In what has become nearly a weekly experience, the Bush Administration has

again ignored international concerns and acted unilaterally on a foreign

policy issue.  This time, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, John

Bolton, has told the Russians that they have until November to agree to

radical changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) or else the U.S.

would give its six month notice for pulling out of the treaty.  Such a

statement, much less unilaterally pulling out of the ABM Treaty, is

dangerous to U.S. and world security.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bolton's statement reiterates the fact that the ABM Treaty is the

Administration's boogeyman, and they are hell-bent on killing it,

regardless of the circumstances,&quot; stated Chris Madison, the Council for a

Livable World Education Fund's National Missile Defense Campaign Director. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What makes Bolton's statement so absurd is that there is no need to rush

the demise of the ABM Treaty.  Anti-missile technology has not shown itself

to work, so there is no system ready to deploy.  Moreover, there is so much

testing of anti-missile technology left to do that it could be years before

the Pentagon really needed to conduct tests that would violate the ABM

Treaty.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philip Coyle, the Pentagon's previous Director of Operational Test and

Evaluation, has stated that &quot;the 1972 treaty is not holding back design and

development of the technology needed for National Missile Defense (NMD),

nor is the treaty slowing the testing of an NMD system.  Development of NMD

will take a decade or more for technical and budgetary reasons, but not due

to impediments caused by the ABM treaty...Until the U.S. government learns

whether the technical, budgetary, and operational problems that National

Missile Defense presents can be solved, the ABM treaty is the least of

President Bush's problems.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Bush Administration's goal is

the total destruction of all arms control agreements, and they mean to

achieve that by dismantling the ABM Treaty, whether or not Russia, China,

or our NATO allies like it.  However, ultimatums rarely work in diplomatic

circles, so, as every other country in the world wants to see the ABM

Treaty intact, the diplomatic and strategic fallout could be disastrous.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Administration claims they are &#145;consulting' with Russia regarding a

new strategic framework.  But giving the Russians the options of either

modifying the ABM Treaty in a way that virtually eviscerates it, or having

the U.S. unilaterally abrogate the treaty is no option at all.  These are

consultations in name only,&quot; claimed Luke Warren, the Council's head

analyst and media director.
