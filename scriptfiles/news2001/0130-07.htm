- January 30 -  Public Citizen today released <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/regs-/regsdelay.htm">a compilation</a> of crucial

consumer, worker and environmental protections that were recently approved by the Clinton

administration but delayed by the incoming Bush administration. The delay could be

detrimental to the environment, people&#146;s health and our natural resources, Public

Citizen has concluded. Further, the safety standards that are in limbo could be

dramatically altered before being allowed to take effect.

<p>President Bush&#146;s chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., issued a memo on Jan. 20,

2001, to federal agency heads in which he postponed for 60 days the effective date of any

new regulation that has been published in the Federal Register and has not yet taken

effect, so long as a deadline for the rule is not statutorily or judicially mandated. This

would affect scores of new safety standards approved by Clinton agency heads in recent

months, including at least 12 rules that would make major improvements in protecting the

public, workers and the environment, according to Public Citizen&#146;s report,

&quot;Public Safeguards at Risk!&quot;</p>



<p>The Card memo also requires agencies to withdraw new safety standards that had been

signed and sent to the Office of Federal Register for publication but had not been

published prior to the issuance of the memo. The report identifies at least three

standards affected by this requirement: Environmental Protection Agency rules to improve

air quality and eliminate haze, and require monitoring of the environmental and health

effects of genetically modified crops, and a proposed Agriculture Department rule

requiring packagers of hot dogs and ready-to-eat meats to test for the dangerous <i>Listeria</i>

pathogen.</p>



<p>&quot;No law gives Mr. Card the authority to stay rules that have been signed, sealed,

delivered and published,&quot; said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook.

&quot;It&#146;s urgent that these protections, which represent years of work by agency

experts, move forward. If industry groups object to any final standards they can petition

for reconsideration, not use their financial connections to the Bush administration to try

to rescind, delay, defang or derail these standards.&quot;</p>



<p>The Public Citizen report also documents 12 &quot;Safeguards to Watch,&quot;

regulations that are so named because they are key to public health and the environment

but are likely to be strongly opposed by industry groups, which are sure to use their

close connections to the Bush administration to try to derail them. </p>



<p>&quot;The Card memo is just the opening skirmish in what we expect to be a protracted

war between special interests and the public&#146;s interest under the Bush

administration,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen&#146;s Congress

Watch. &quot;We anticipate a return to the ways of the former Reagan and Bush I

administrations, when important safeguards proposed by the agencies were sent into an OMB

[Office of Management and Budget] &#145;black hole,&#146; where they were delayed for

years, eviscerated or buried under the guise of administration &#145;review.&#146; &quot; </p>



<p>The report identifies many of the uncertainties and legal issues raised by the Card

memo. For instance, Public Citizen questions whether there is legal authority for the

president, or his chief of staff, to order an across-the-board 60-day freeze of the

effective date of standards promulgated by agency heads.</p>
