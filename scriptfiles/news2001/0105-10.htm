- January 5 - The ice storm that left thousands of 

                          Arkansas residents without power over the holidays has 

                          also devastated the state'ss large population of chickens 

                          housed on factory farms, The Humane Society of the United 

                          States has found. Snow and ice storms that swept through 

                          Arkansas in mid- and late-December collapsed barns, 

                          injuring and killing thousands of chickens owned by 

                          Tyson Foods, Inc. and Foster Farms. Weeks after the 

                          disasters occurred, inadequate efforts had been made 

                          to either rescue the chickens or humanely euthanize 

                          the injured and dying birds.

<p>Representatives from The Humane Society of the United 

                          States (HSUS) who were on the scene after the storms 

                          have captured on video dead and dying chickens among 

                          the debris of collapsed chicken houses. HSUS came upon 

                          the disasters last weekend, when they found thousands 

                          of chickens, used as broiler-breeders (meat chickens), 

                          had died from building collapses or that were suffering 

                          and dying from exposure to intense cold weather conditions, 

                          starvation and thirst. The footage was shot at a Tyson 

                          farm in Logan County and a Foster Farm location in Hot 

                          Springs County. </p>

                        <p>The video footage can be seen on The HSUS Animal Channel 

                          at www.animalchannel.net. Additional information on 

                          the Arkansas disaster and factory farms can be found 

                          on The HSUS Web site at www.hsus.org. </p>

                        <p>Arkansas is the second largest producer of broiler 

                          chickens in the U.S. behind Georgia. Tyson Foods, Inc., 

                          ranks number one in broiler production while Foster 

                          Farms ranks eighth, according to the National Chicken 

                          Council. </p>

                        <p>At the Foster Farm location, chicken barns with an 

                          estimated 13,000 chickens, collapsed after the mid-December 

                          storms. Company representatives recently came to the 

                          farm and shot thousands of the surviving birds. The 

                          dead chickens, and many others still alive, were left 

                          at the scene. HSUS has learned that both companies rounded 

                          up and removed most of the remaining live chickens from 

                          the disaster areas earlier this week, but also left 

                          many behind. </p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, farmers are contracted to house and 

                          care for the chickens but do not actually own them. 

                          According to industry practices and the farmers themselves, 

                          farmers are prohibited from making any decisions to 

                          humanely euthanize the birds, as they are legally not 

                          their property. The farmers are under direction from 

                          the companies they work for on how to respond to such 

                          situations. </p>

                        <p>&quot;This was a recipe for disaster," said David Kuemmerle, 

                          HSUS program manager for Farm Animals and Sustainable 

                          Agriculture. &quot;Factory farms such as Tyson and Foster 

                          Farms house chickens in intensive confinement systems 

                          that are inherently inhumane. When thousands of chickens 

                          are kept under one roof it is virtually impossible to 

                          provide for safe evacuation, on site care of surviving 

                          birds, or even the humane euthanasia of birds that are 

                          too injured or inaccessible to human rescuers.&quot; 

                        </p>

                        <p>A year ago, the industry in Arkansas suffered a loss 

                          of more than $25 million in damages when ice storms 

                          collapsed more than 500 chicken houses. Despite that 

                          catastrophe, poultry companies have yet to implement 

                          responsible disaster plans for their facilities. As 

                          mere commodities, animals are insured against loss along 

                          with the buildings in which they are kept. </p>

                        <p>When disaster hits, animals suffer through their injuries, 

                          or die of starvation, thirst and exposure. &quot;The 

                          effects of such disasters on factory farms are not only 

                          detrimental to the animals, but can pose serious threats 

                          to human health and the surrounding environment as well,&quot; 

                          said Suzanne Millman, PhD, HSUS Director of Scientific 

                          Programs for Farm Animals and Sustainable Agriculture. 

                          &quot;The state of North Carolina has still not fully 

                          determined the long term effects to communities as a 

                          result of massive hog manure lagoons that broke or overflowed 

                          during flooding in 1999. We need to rethink the way 

                          we are raising farm animals and find alternatives to 

                          raising them in such large concentrations, where animals 

                          are treated inhumanely, and seriously threaten the health 

                          of consumers and the environment," Millman said. </p>
