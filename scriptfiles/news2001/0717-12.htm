- July 17 - Editorial writers across the United States have responded with indignation

to John Bolton's speech at the United Nations on July 9th, in which he

stated that the U.S. would not sign any document that infringes on U.S.

citizens' constitutional right to bear arms.  As the following excerpts

point out, the Bush administration, attempting to satisfy its conservative

base, is continuing to act unilaterally without regard to the impact its

policies are having on allies and enemies alike.  To the detriment of U.S.

national security, the administration's position will only impede the

progress that the conference hopes to make in preventing the countless

deaths caused by small arms proliferation.



<p>Baltimore Sun, July 12, 2001: "Bush administration grandstands on the wrong

side at U.N."<br>

"The Bush administration's posture is the most egregious of its

isolationist gestures in international affairs, some of which it later

clarified into reasonable positions.  The U.S. delegation can yet find that

its scruples about legitimate possession of personal weapons are not

compromised.  The goal should be to restrain the trade in weapons that are

most sought by terrorists, child armies and narco- trafficking gangsters.

Surely, the President cannot object to that."



<p>Minneapolis Star Tribune, July 13, 2001: "Stop the world's gun runners"<br>

"It's pretty hard to see a downside to slowing the flow of grenade

launchers and AK-47s to the world's civil wars.  Yet somehow Bush has

managed.  This must be because he's looking through NRA glasses, which can

make almost anything look like a threat to American gun owners."



<p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 15, 2001: "Curtail Traffic in Small Arms"<br>

"The U.S. cannot avoid its share of the responsibility for the

proliferation of these weapons, since it is the world's leading

exporter...The illegal commerce in weapons that kill a half-million people

every year is- or should be - a matter of concern to our country's top arms

control official.  It deserved more than the facile, reflexive and ignorant

scorn it received."



<p>New York Times, July 11, 2001: "An American Retreat on Small Arms"<br>

" ... by signaling its skepticism about small arms curbs, Washington may

have stalled what little momentum there was toward broader international

cooperation against the small-arms trade.  His speech affords political

cover for other major weapons producers like Russia and China that have

been recalcitrant about effective international curbs, not to mention the

cash-poor governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America that have been

their faithful customers."



<p>Rocky Mountain News, July 11, 2001: "Tackling the Armed Brigades"<br>

"[John Bolton] did not explain the relevance of the Second Amendment to the

U.S. Constitution to the people of Sierra Leone or Indonesia.  Somalia,

where everyone keeps, bears and uses assault weapons, has dissolved into

murderous anarchy, and the Somalis are spreading surplus weapons, and

bloodshed, into neighboring Kenya ... But armed brigands, with seemingly

unlimited access to modern weapons, are a world problem; if we don't like

this proposed solution ... we have an obligation to present an effective

proposal of our own in a cooperative spirit."



<p>St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 16,2001: "Exporting Bloodshed"<br>

"As it did in rejecting the Kyoto protocol on global warming, the

Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the formation of a permanent International

Criminal Court for war crimes at The Hague, the Bush administration again

has displayed arrogant apathy toward the rest of the world's problems and a

refusal to take a more productive role in resolving them."
