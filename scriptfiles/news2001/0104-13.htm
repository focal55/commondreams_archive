- January 4 - Last month, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force urged death penalty opponents to ask the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board to recommend clemency in the case of Wanda Jean Allen, who was sentenced to death for the shooting death of her lesbian lover. On Dec. 15, 2000, the board voted against granting clemency. (Details on the case are provided below.)

<P>

Without a favorable recommendation from the board, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating does not have the ability to grant clemency, but he does have the power to postpone the execution for 60 days. A stay in the case would give Allen’s attorneys valuable time to find other ways to halt her execution and may give the Oklahoma Legislature an opportunity to vote on HB 1013, legislation that would impose a one-year moratorium on executions in the state. Beginning on January 4, 2001, nine executions in 30 days are scheduled in the state.

<P>

Oklahoma residents and others opposed to the death penalty are urged to contact Gov. Keating and ask him to grant a stay in the Wanda Jean Allen case. His contact information appears below:

<B>Background on the Wanda Jean Allen Case</B>

<P>

After two years of being involved in a violent relationship, Allen, an African-American lesbian, admitted to shooting her partner, Gloria Leathers, on Dec. 1, 1989 just outside Oklahoma City. On Dec. 5, 2000, NGLTF along with several other GLBT organizations issued a statement calling upon the Pardon and Parole Board and Gov. Keating to grant clemency to Allen. The groups urged clemency in her case both because of opposition to the death penalty and because of questions that have been raised regarding whether Allen received a fair trial. If she had been granted clemency, Allen would have served a life sentence in the Oklahoma State prison system.

<P>

Allen’s attorney failed to investigate fully Allen’s background showing that she has an IQ of 80 and has neurological problems that cause her to lose control in stressful situations - factors that were not introduced into court.  In addition, according to a review of court records, prosecutors attempted to use Allen’s sexual orientation and her relationship with her partner to prejudice the jury against her.
