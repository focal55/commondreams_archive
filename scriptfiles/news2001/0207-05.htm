- February 7 - A coalition of student demonstrators in co-operation 

with Greenpeace protested in front of the do-it-yourself store 

WICKES in Bangor today, demanding that they immediately stop 

selling products from International Forest Products (Interfor). 

Interfor is a logging company which clear-cuts trees in the largest 

unprotected ancient temperate rainforest in the world.  Some 

students were perched atop tall wooden structures, blocking 

entrances to the store.

<p>

"WICKES knows the atrocities that Interfor commits in the ancient 

temperate rainforest in British Columbia, Canada and yet they still 

carry Interfor's products," said Mike Roselle, Forests Campaigner 

for Greenpeace. "Today's protest is part of a national grass roots 

uprising.  Concerned citizens are doing everything in their power to 

expose both Interfor's highly destructive practices and the stores 

that refuse to stop selling their products."  

</p>

<p>

Interfor's disregard for the environment is well known and 

documented.  From 1995 to 1997, Interfor and its subsidiaries have 

been charged and penalized 136 times for violating British Columbia 

legislation, including several infractions of the Forest Practices 

Code.  

</p>

<p>

"Companies who do business with Interfor need to answer to their 

customers for their own role in destroying our global treasures," said 

Rob Fish, a student demonstrator. "Customers have the right to 

know if the products they buy are fueling the destruction of our 

planet's last ancient forests." According to the World Resources 

Institute, temperate rainforests are the most endangered forest type 

on Earth.  

</p>

<p>

Greenpeace is calling for a logging moratorium on all intact valleys 

and key ecological areas within the Great Bear Rainforest until the 

completion and adoption of a meaningful conservation and 

ecosystem-based management plan for the coastal rainforest. If 

logging is determined to be appropriate, Greenpeace maintains that 

forest products must come from well-managed forests that have 

been certified to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards or 

better. Many retailers, including home furnishing giant IKEA, have 

already pledged to use only forest products that have been FSC-

certified.  

</p>

<p>

Although many forestry companies operating in the Great Bear 

Rainforest are working with environmental organizations in British 

Columbia to protect highly contentious areas within the rainforest, 

Interfor walked away from negotiations and has resumed its logging 

plans. Since then, environmentalists have exposed the company's 

plans to log 18 pristine valleys and critically important areas of the 

Great Bear Rainforest in the next five years.
