- May 2 -  President

                    George W. Bush is using tomorrow's National Day of Prayer to

                    help promote the Religious Right agenda and further cement

                    his ties with religious conservatives, Americans United for

                    Separation of Church and State has charged.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;George

                    W. Bush is president of all the people,&quot; said the Rev.

                    Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. &quot;He

                    should not use his office to promote a narrow religious

                    agenda. He holds the office of president, not national

                    pastor.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

                    1952 Congress passed a federal law requiring an annual

                    observance of a national day of prayer. In 1988, at the

                    behest of the Religious Right, the date of the event was

                    officially set by Congress as the first Thursday in May.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since

                    then, control of the observance, intended to be broadly

                    ecumenical, has been effectively taken over by the Religious

                    Right. The National Day of Prayer Task Force, a nonprofit

                    private group headed by Shirley Dobson, wife of Religious

                    Right broadcaster James Dobson, coordinates virtually all of

                    the prayer day events in Washington, D.C., and around the

                    country.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                    NDP Task Force operates from the headquarters of Dobson's

                    Focus on the Family in Colorado Springs, Colo. As expected,

                    the Task Force's events reflect a fundamentalist Christian

                    view of the world and advance the claim that America is a

                    Christian nation.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite

                    this narrow religious approach, President Bush is actively

                    assisting the Dobson crusade. According to a May 2 Focus on

                    the Family fax newsletter, White House liaison Tim Goeglin

                    says NDP events in Washington, D.C., will be hosted by Bush.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In

                    his April 30 NDP proclamation Bush adopted the Task Force

                    theme of &quot;One Nation Under God&quot; as his own. He

                    even quoted from a special prayer written for the Task Force

                    by evangelist Billy Graham.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The

                    Bush actions have won the president support from James

                    Dobson, an influential figure in the Religious Right whose

                    broadcasting empire has an annual budget of over $120

                    million and millions of followers.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According

                    to <i>World</i> magazine, an evangelical publication, Dobson

                    said he is &quot;very encouraged&quot; by the Bush

                    administration's early record, particularly the president's

                    assistance to Dobson's wife Shirley on the prayer day

                    activities.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans

                    United's Lynn said the situation is unfortunate.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Americans

                    don't need the president and Congress telling us when to

                    pray,&quot; he said. &quot;And we certainly don't need the

                    White House using its bully pulpit to advance the Religious

                    Right's radical gameplan.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn

                    noted that Dobson's religious veneer masks an extreme

                    political agenda. His ministry assails church-state

                    separation, public schools, feminists, gay people and even

                    the concept of tolerance. Focus on the Family has even

                    launched attacks on the Girl Scouts for alleged liberalism.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn

                    also pointed out that key Founders such as James Madison and

                    Thomas Jefferson thought presidential prayer day

                    proclamations were violations of the constitutional

                    separation of church and state.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Madison,

                    the &quot;Father of the Constitution,&quot; said such

                    proclamations are inappropriate. &quot;They seem to imply

                    and certainly nourish the erroneous idea of a <i>national</i>

                    religion,&quot; Madison wrote in a document referred to as

                    the &quot;Detached Memoranda.&quot;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jefferson,

                    a leading visionary on religious liberty, made a similar

                    argument, writing to the Rev. Samuel Miller in 1808,

                    &quot;Fasting and prayer are religious exercises; the

                    enjoining them an act of discipline. Every religious society

                    has a right to determine for itself the times for these

                    exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to

                    their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer

                    than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited

                    it.&quot;</font></p>
