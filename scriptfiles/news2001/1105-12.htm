<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - November 5 - Greenpeace activists in 17 countries, including the U.S., converged on Japanese embassies today to protest the imminent departure of Japan's whaling fleet. In Washington, protesters were adorned with giant eyeballs and held ribbon-like banners that read &quot;Don't Go Whaling.&quot; The protesters also delivered a letter to the Japanese ambassador, urging him to call off the upcoming hunt. The protests were accompanied by a worldwide cyberaction with thousands of virtual activists sending letters and e-mails via Greenpeace's website to Japan's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's not too late for the Prime Minister to save face and prevent the whaling fleet from departing,&quot; said Audrey Cardwell, Greenpeace Oceans Campaigner. &quot;Greenpeace will keep intense global pressure on Japan until it stops hunting whales.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan's whaling fleet is expected to depart the Southern port of Shimonoseki this week to hunt 440 minke whales in the Southern Ocean. The five-ship fleet is made up of a 300-foot factory processing ship, three catcher ships armed with grenade-tipped harpoons, and a spotting boat. Japan claims their hunts are for scientific research purposes, though the meat is sold as a delicacy. No other scientists see a need to kill whales for scientific research.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Japan needs to stop disrupting the balance of such a fragile ecosystem and stop defending their position with bogus science,&quot; asked Cardwell. &quot;If Japan continues to push for large-scale commercial whaling, there won't be any whales left that aren't endangered.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the diplomatic front, Japan has been taking steps to buy a majority of the votes at the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which is the body charged with protecting the world's whale population. Japan has admitted that it uses overseas aid to bribe developing countries for votes in the Caribbean and elsewhere. New countries that have no direct interest in whaling, such as Morocco, have also been recruited by Japan to join the IWC. As a result of these efforts, the world is now perilously close to a resumption of wide-scale commercial whale hunts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Japanese fleet hunts over 550 whales each year, ignoring a worldwide ban that has been in place since 1986. According to the IWC's Scientific Committee, the minke whale populations that Japan hunts in the Southern Ocean appear to be in &quot;precipitous&quot; decline, and the IWC has strongly urged Japan to halt its lethal takes of minke whales. </font></p>
