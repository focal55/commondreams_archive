- January 29 - Following a news report that the Web-filtering company N2H2 Inc. gathers

data on children as they surf the Web in school and sells it to

marketers and the Defense Department, Commercial Alert director Gary

Ruskin called N2H2 a &quot;corporate predator that snoops on schoolchildren

for monetary gain.&quot;  Commercial Alert urged parents, school board

members, principals and teachers to rid the schools of N2H2's

child-tracking software.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commercial Alert sent a letter today to Secretary of Defense Donald H.

Rumsfeld asking the Defense Department not to hire N2H2 to spy on the

Web-browsing of the nation's schoolchildren.  The letter said that

&quot;During the Clinton Administration, the Defense Department must have

grown confused about its mission.  It should spy on national security

threats, not our own schoolchildren.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On January 26th, The Wall Street Journal reported that N2H2's Bess

filtering system &quot;knows where the students go on the Web and how long

they spend there....Late last year, N2H2 began selling its data.  The

information, called Class Clicks, is aggregated, meaning it can't be

used to identify surfing habits of specific students, or even specific

schools....for $15,000 a year, marketers and Web-site operators can get

monthly reports that detail where kids are going on the Internet, along

with Roper Starch's aggregate estimates of the kids' ages and races.&quot;

The Journal noted that, so far, N2H2's only clients for the student

marketing data are BigChalk Inc. and the Defense Department.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">N2H2 is widely used in the nation's schools.  According to the Journal,

&quot;Just under half of all schools and libraries use some sort of filtering

software, and N2H2 has 20% of this market, according to International

Data Corp.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Schoolchildren should not be for sale, nor should they be pawns in any

corporation's marketing plans,&quot; Ruskin said.  &quot;N2H2 is trying to turn

the schools into little market research factories.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The use of N2H2 software is an abusive extension of government power to

enable marketers to spy on unsuspecting schoolchildren,&quot; Ruskin said. 

&quot;N2H2's data gathering and surveillance practices are creepy.  It is not

the proper role of the public schools to help corporations or the

Defense Department to obtain information from vulnerable

schoolchildren.  School board members, principals and teachers should

work together to rid the schools of N2H2's prying software.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following is today's letter from Commercial Alert to Secretary of

Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Secretary Rumsfeld:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Defense

Department is a client of N2H2 Inc., which uses child-tracking software

to snoop on the Web-browsing of our nation's schoolchildren, and then

sells the data to marketers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the Clinton Administration, the Defense Department must have

threats, not our own schoolchildren.  Please straighten this out, and

cut all Defense Department ties to N2H2 immediately.  Thank you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following is an article from the January 26 edition of the <i>Wall Street

Journa</i>l.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Web-Filter Data From Schools Is Put Up for Sale by Company</b>

<br>

by Jason Anders</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Few companies know more about what children do on the Internet at school

than N2H2 Inc. The company's Web-filtering software, called Bess, is

used by more than 12 million students in kindergarten through 12th

grade, and new federal rules are likely to push the number higher.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because it typically is installed as a school's gatekeeper to the

Internet, Bess knows where the students go on the Web and how long they

spend there. It also knows when students try to access a site that's on

N2H2's blacklist for being too violent or containing pornography.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question is whether marketers should get to know students' surfing

habits, too. Late last year, N2H2 began selling its data. The

information, called Class Clicks, is aggregated, meaning it can't be

used to identify surfing habits of specific students, or even specific

schools. But privacy advocates say the sale of children's usage data is

troubling, and they worry that marketers are encroaching on ground that

once was sacred.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Students just should not be contributing to marketing tools and

subjected to profiling based on how they are using the educational tools

of the Internet,&quot; says David Sobel, general counsel at the Electronic

Privacy Information Center in Washington.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">N2H2 spokesman Allen Goldblatt counters that schools and parents have no

reason to be concerned. &quot;This is a real nonissue for us,&quot; he says. &quot;This

information is so anonymous and vague.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just under half of all schools and libraries use some sort of filtering

software, and N2H2 has about 20% of this market, according to

International Data Corp., a research firm. The new Children's Internet

Protection Act makes the use of such software a requirement for schools

and libraries that want to obtain money from the federal E-rate program,

which helps schools get on the Internet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">N2H2 says it began tracking students' Internet activities in late 1999.

It figured the data would be useful to teachers and to operators of

educational Web sites. Then, in the summer of 2000, it began looking

into other uses of the data. It soon began talking with New York

marketing firm Roper Starch Worldwide about developing a marketing

product the two could sell.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, for $15,000 a year, marketers and Web-site operators can

get monthly reports that detail where kids are going on the Internet,

along with Roper Starch's aggregate estimates of the kids' ages and

races. At its most specific, N2H2 says, the reports group students into

one of nine U.S. census districts. The company says there is no way for

buyers of the data to figure out who the students are.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We would never do anything that compromises the trust of the students

or the schools.  To date, we haven't had a single school district that

has asked us to remove it from the sample,&quot; says Cory Finnell, director

of analytics for N2H2, which is based in Seattle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still, it is unclear how many of N2H2's school clients realize that

their students' Web activities are part of a marketing product. N2H2

says schools were specifically told that the company was collecting the

data in a December 1999 report that was sent to all of the company's

educational clients. But the report was written months before N2H2 first

met with Roper Starch and it doesn't mention any plans to sell the

school traffic data.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jeff Johnson, who oversees computer operations for the Greendale School

District, a former N2H2 client in Greendale, Wis., says he didn't know

information was being collected for a marketing program. &quot;That's

something I would have a big problem with,&quot; he says. &quot;It seems

inappropriate.&quot; His school stopped using N2H2's software last fall over

an unrelated issue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kent Guske, technology director for Worth County Schools in Sylvester,

Ga., also says he didn't know that N2H2 was selling data. But he

considers the marketing effort benign: &quot;I don't really see why it would

be a concern if it's just general usage data on where kids are going,&quot;

he says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress moved to protect children's online privacy with the Children's

Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, or Coppa, which took effect in

April 2000. The act was designed, in part, to protect young children

from marketing efforts. But privacy advocates argue that it doesn't go

far enough and note that it doesn't prohibit the kind of data collection

N2H2 is doing. The act, which applies to children younger than 13,

prohibits the collection of personal information that can be used to

identify someone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For its part, SurfControl PLC, another maker of filtering software and

one of N2H2's competitors, says it doesn't collect data on any of its

users' surfing habits and believes it would be inappropriate to do so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">N2H2 acknowledges the company's software, which often is configured to

act as a &quot;proxy server,&quot; collects a wide range of data, just as the

servers of any Internet service provider do. Proxy servers, which act as

gateways for Internet traffic, can log a user's Web activities --

including sites visited, pictures viewed and information submitted in

forms. N2H2 says it has built in safeguards to make sure that only

anonymous aggregate data become part of its marketing effort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deborah Pierce, an attorney who specializes in privacy matters for the

Electronic Frontier Foundation, says she is troubled by the amount of

data collected. &quot;The bottom line is to get this data they're selling

they're actually collecting a lot more data on their server logs,&quot; she

says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robert Belair, a privacy attorney with the Washington firm Mullenholz,

Brimsek &amp; Belair, says N2H2's data collection complies with Coppa. &quot;From

a legal standpoint, it sounds like they're fine. But I always tell my

clients that public relations is a different matter,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, very few people have seen the data N2H2 is selling. Despite

discounting the product to $10,000, Roper Starch has sold the product to

only two clients: New York-based education portal BigChalk Inc. and the

Defense Department. (N2H2, which went public in July 1999, has yet to

report a profit.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BigChalk purchased the data because it wanted a better idea of how it

was stacking up against competitors, says Nan Halperin, vice president

of sales and marketing. She says the company wasn't concerned about the

way the data were being collected. &quot;I don't think the data [are] being

used inappropriately, nor do I think that's a threat,&quot; she says.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Defense Department didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP</b><br>

Find out if your local public schools use N2H2 Web-filters.  If they do,

then work with your local school board, principal and teachers to get

their child-tracking software out of the schools.</font></p>
