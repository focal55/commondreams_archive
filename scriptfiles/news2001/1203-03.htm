-  December 3 - The UK government remained under pressure today not to begin operations at its controversial new Sellafield nuclear fuel plant after a ruling today by a United Nations Tribunal on a legal challenge by the Irish government which was based on concerns about radioactive pollution of the Irish Sea and dangers of terrorist attacks. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ireland had requested The United Nations International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, made up of 21 judges, to issue provisional measures (a form of injunction) against the UK government, including that the Sellafield MOX fuel plant (SMP)authorization should be withdrawn and that there be no nuclear transports into or out of Sellafield associated with the SMP. The Tribunal did not issue the measures requested by Ireland. However, in a move that will embarrass the UK government, the Tribunal did issue provisional measures that may have the same effect as those originally sought by Ireland: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- the judges unanimously rejected UK claims that the Law of the Sea Convention Tribunal did not have jurisdiction; - the judges called on the UK and Ireland to undertake no action &quot;which might aggravate the dispute&quot; &#150; for Greenpeace this means that BNFL should not proceed with MOX production, scheduled to begin around December 20th 2001; In terms of provisional measures, the Tribunal instructed: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both parties to &quot;cooperate&quot; and enter into consultation to exchange information with regard to possible consequences for the Irish Sea arising out of the commissioning of the MOX plant, to monitor risks or the effects of the operation of the MOX plant for the Irish Sea, and to devise as appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment which might arise from the operation of the plant. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The judges have recognized that the UK should not do anything that would aggravate the dispute between Ireland and the UK. The obvious point here is that turning on the MOX plant will certainly aggravate the dispute &#150; the UK should therefore abandon its plans for MOX production to start at the end of the month,&quot; said Duncan Currie, legal counsel for Greenpeace International. &quot;It also seems impossible to design appropriate measures to prevent pollution of the marine environment which might arise from the operation of the MOX plant once it is commissioned&#148;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The provisional measures agreed to by the Tribunal will remain in force until the conclusion of international arbitration to be held under the auspices of the International Convention on the Law of the Sea. Hearings are expected to begin in early 2002. The Tribunal also stated that further measures could be passed by the Tribunal if necessary. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace is also encouraged by the views of seven of the judges that &quot;the Tribunal has identified the duty to cooperate as a fundamental principle in the regime of the prevention of pollution of the marine environment under Part XII of the Convention and general international law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of nuclear transports, BNFL will not be able to make any MOX transports into or out of Sellafield while the ITLOS judgment is in force. Perhaps of most significance the planned return of rejected MOX fuel from Japan to Sellafield, due in 2002, will now be under threat. The fuel was originally shipped by BNFL in 1999, but after admitting that it contained falsified quality control data, it was agreed by Japan and the UK governments to ship it back to the UK. BNFL hopes that its return will help secure new large contracts for the SMP with Japanese utilities. Ireland in its evidence to the Tribunal held in November, made the case that there were major safety and security issues involved in nuclear transports which the UK have not adequately addressed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Tribunal has also established the right of states threatened by pollution from transports to be consulted &#150; this is a major step forward for the rights of en- route states opposed to the transport of nuclear material, including high level waste and plutonium MOX fuel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The UK government has to seriously reflect on today&#146;s judgment. A plutonium business that makes no economic sense, leads to widespread contamination of the environment, whilst presenting a major proliferation and terrorist threat, deserves no future. The Tribunal has issued an important judgment. today, the Irish government is right to be pleased by this judgment., and BNFL and the UK government know that this is a red not a green light to MOX production,&#148; said Shaun Burnie nuclear campaigner with Greenpeace International. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Greenpeace/Friends of the Earth UK expect to hear within days the result of their lawsuit against the UK government&#146;s decision to authorize the MOX plant. The Court of Appeal in London heard the case last week. </font></p>
