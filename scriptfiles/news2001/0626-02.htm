<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last 100 years, industrialized countries, with 20 percent of the world's population, were responsible for 60 percent of the net carbon emissions that are driving global warming, according to the report, &quot;The U.S., Developing Countries, and Climate Protection: Leadership or Stalemate?&quot; The United States topped the list of carbon emitters from fossil fuels, accounting for 30 percent of the total from 1900-99, while China contributed only 7 percent and India, 2 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite increasing amounts of carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries, the United States will continue to dominate the production of this heat-trapping gas 10 years from now, increasing its emission by about 300 million tons of carbon by 2010. In contrast, India and China's combined emissions will be only four-fifths those of the U.S. total by 2010, despite the fact that these two countries represent 40 percent of the world's population. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the report, a per-capita approach reveals the same pattern. In 1999, U.S. emissions averaged about 5.6 tons of carbon per person. This is about 20 times the amount of carbon emission per person in India and more than 10 times that of the average Chinese. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. should attend to curbing its own prodigious output of greenhouse gases before asking developing countries to do more,&quot; said Kevin Baumert, one of the study's authors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report was released today as government officials start their closed-door meetings to discuss the negotiating text of the Kyoto Protocol, prior to the formal negotiations in Bonn, Germany, July 16-27. U.S. President George W. Bush had earlier repudiated the Kyoto Protocol, insisting that developing countries should also limit their emissions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the long-term, most countries-including developing countries-will need to do more to rein in their greenhouse gas emissions,&quot; said Dr. Nancy Kete, co-author of the report and director of WRI's Climate, Energy and Pollution Program. &quot;To get the ball rolling in the near term, however, climate protection requires the leadership of a few countries that bear historical responsibility for the problem and that have considerable capability to act - that means first and foremost, the U.S.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study said that despite the lack of legal commitments from developing countries to curb their carbon emissions, they have taken action, unlike most developed countries, which promised but have not done so. China, for example, reduced its emissions by 17 percent from 1997 to 1999. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;China's achievement is unprecedented. Over the same period, China succeeded in substantially growing its economy while markedly reducing its emissions,&quot; said Dr. Kete. These reductions, achieved through sweeping energy pricing and policy reforms, as well as the promotion of energy efficiency, is equal to the 400 million tons of carbon that the U.S. transportation sector emitted last year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study suggests that the U.S. and other industrialized countries can promote international cooperation on climate protection by:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recognizing and building on climate-friendly policies already being undertaken in developing countries. Implementing voluntary measures that provide local benefits while curbing emissions is the most practical and realistic way for most developing countries to contribute to climate protection.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding technical cooperation programs to assist poor countries in adapting to climate change and reducing emissions. This is important since other non-climate priorities will continue to dominate the development agenda of poor countries.

<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Promoting climate protection in developing countries that is supportive of economic and social development. For example, the Kyoto Protocol's clean development mechanism, which has garnered strong support from both developing countries and the U.S. private sector, can provide such benefits.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A short-term focus on developing country commitments may be politically expedient for those who remain opposed to climate protection,&quot; said Dr. Kete. &quot;However, it is misguided, and it has precipitated an outcome where no one acts and everyone loses.&quot; </font></p>
