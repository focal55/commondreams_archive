- January 4 - Democrats.com, the largest

independent community of Democratic voters and activists, today

called on Congress to reject Florida's 25 electoral votes.

Congress will meet in a joint session at 1 p.m. Saturday to select

the next President by counting the Electoral votes. Under the

Constitution, Congress alone has the power to reject invalid

Electors.

<p>Democrats.com is organizing rallies at the district offices of

Senators and Representatives on Friday at 12 noon, including both

Democrats (Barbara Boxer, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Zell Miller,

Carrie Meek, and Robert Wexler) and Republicans (Rick Santorum).

Democrats.com is also sponsoring a rally outside Congress on

Saturday starting at noon. "We call upon all Americans who are

outraged by the election to call and visit the offices of their

representatives and tell them that Florida's Electors were stolen,

not won, and should therefore be rejected by Congress on Saturday,"

said Democrats.com co-founder Bob Fertik.

<p>"Our investigations and those of independent news organizations

have revealed significant evidence of voter intimidation,

deliberate fraud, and a conspiracy to suppress voter turnout by

illegal methods," said Democrats.com co-founder David Lytel. Under

constitutional procedures established more than 100 years ago, the

electoral votes of any state may be challenged by any member of the

House of Representatives in conjunction with any member of the

Senate. The challenge requires that each house debate for two

hours and decide by majority vote.

<p>The more than 15,000 members and subscribers of Democrats.com

contributed more than $30,000 to enable the organization to hire

lawyers and investigators to uncover evidence of official

misconduct in Florida's presidential election. The complete

catalogue of crimes against democracy in Florida is presented at

<a href="http://www.trustthepeople.com">http://www.trustthepeople.com</a>

<p>"With all due respect to Vice President Gore, we believe that it

is the duty of the American people assembled in Congress to

determine how much election fraud we as a nation are prepared to

accept," said Fertik. "The continued tabulation of votes in Florida

-- blocked for so long by Republicans -- is making it clear beyond

a doubt that Al Gore won Florida by several thousand votes. The

evidence shows that Republicans went to extraordinary lengths to

disenfranchise Democrats in general and African American Democrats

in particular," he added. "History is watching, and Congress must

take a stand for the sake of our Democracy," he concluded.
