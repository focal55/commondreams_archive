<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK   

- November 1 - A diverse coalition of 48 humanitarian, religious, human rights and civil liberties organizations today released a set of recommendations for responding to the September 11th attacks. The groups stressed the importance of abiding by human rights and humanitarian law in acting to bring the perpetrators to justice and preventing future attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&nbsp;The groups urged the United States to take &quot;every reasonable step to ensure security for everyone in the United States,&quot; and called on the government to investigate and prosecute hate crimes and to uphold democratic freedoms.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Looking abroad, the groups said that &quot;security and justice are mutually reinforcing goals that ultimately depend upon the  promotion of all human rights for all people&quot; and called on the United States to promote fundamental rights around the world  and to ensure that other countries do not use the fight against terrorism as a pretext to justify repression.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

As the war in Afghanistan continues, the groups advocated for &quot;exceptional attention to protecting civilians and civilian objects from harm,&quot; and &quot;safe access to humanitarian aid and security for humanitarian workers in order to provide the urgent  assistance required by the millions of men, women and children inside Afghanistan.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Groups making the recommendations include: the  Alliance for Justice, Amnesty International USA, CARE, Center for Reproductive Law and Policy,  Doctors of the World-USA, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Muslim Public Affairs Council, National Council of Churches, Open Society Institute, Oxfam America, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees International, Save the Children/US, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and the US Committee for Refugees.  The full statement and a complete list of signers is  attached.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES</b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Following the appalling attacks of September 11, the United States and the international community face an historic challenge: to mount a collective effort to achieve security in a world scarred by atrocities and conflict. To meet this challenge we must recognize that security and justice are mutually reinforcing goals that ultimately depend upon the promotion of all human rights for all people. The principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights demand accountability for those who violate its fundamental principles.  More than that, they offer a universal blueprint for just societies based on the values of liberty, equality, democracy, development, and justice. These principles are not the province of one civilization or culture but the shared birthright of all human beings.  </font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

We therefore propose ten core principles that should guide the response to these attacks, and to those responsible for them.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Condemn the Attacks</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

1.	We condemn the horrendous attacks of September 11. We urge all governments and all people to stand against these and other indiscriminate attacks directed at innocent civilians. </font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Mourn the Victims</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

2.	We mourn the loss of innocent lives and express our solidarity with the victims and their families. </font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Bring the Perpetrators to Justice and Prevent New Attacks</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

3.	We urge all governments to unite to investigate these crimes, to bring to justice those who are responsible, and to prevent future attacks.  </font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Safeguard Liberty while Protecting Security </i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

4.	In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks the U.S. government has the authority and the duty to take every reasonable step to ensure security for everyone in the United States.  Such steps can and must uphold the democratic freedoms cherished by citizens and non-citizens alike.  We are confident that we can reconcile the requirements of security with the blessings of liberty.  </font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Reject Scapegoating</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

5.	We commend public officials and civic and religious leaders who have called on the public not to blame whole communities for the deeds of a few. These leaders and the public at large should continue to work to prevent attacks, harassment, and persecution of people based on their race, religion, national origin, ethnic background, or appearance.  Hate crimes must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.  </font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Promote and Respect Human Rights Worldwide</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

6.	The United States and its allies should not allow the current campaign to prevent them from vigorously and consistently challenging violations of fundamental rights by all governments. They must ensure that governments do not use the fight against terrorism as a pretext to justify repression or the curtailment of rights. And of course they themselves must avoid support for or complicity in abuses.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Respect the Laws of War</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

7.  	The military responses that have been or may be undertaken must pay exceptional attention to protecting civilians and civilian objects from harm as required by international humanitarian law such as the Geneva Conventions. Perpetrators and their accomplices must be distinguished from the civilian population at large and from those who may simply share their religion, ethnicity or national origin. Efforts should also be undertaken to minimize displacement of civilians.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Ensure Humanitarian Access and Protect Those Seeking Refuge</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

8. Governments and other parties must ensure safe access to humanitarian aid and security for humanitarian workers in order to provide the urgent assistance required by the millions of men, women and children inside Afghanistan. Refugees and others in need of international protection must be allowed to leave Afghanistan or other countries to seek safety.  Governments should work together to ensure that countries receiving refugees have the necessary resources to screen the arriving population and to provide them with the required standards of protection, food, water, shelter and other basic needs.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Promote Human Development</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

9.  	Freedom from fear must go hand in hand with freedom from want. A key to security lies in safeguarding and promoting just and equitable societies where people's basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are respected. Today, more than ever, our search for security must include an affirmative commitment to advance this broader rights agenda.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Promote and Defend Open Societies</i></b></font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

10.   	Global security is enhanced by the success of open societies that foster respect for the rule of law and promote tolerance and guarantee people's rights of free expression and peaceful dissent.  We applaud political leaders, in the U.S. and elsewhere, who champion human rights and democratic government.</font></P>
