- February 13 - President George W. Bush, speaking today in Norfolk, VA

focused on the importance of US relations with NATO allies claiming

"nothing must ever divide us." He also discussed the importance of national

missile defenses that could "protect us all."



<p>"President Bush has contradicted himself," said John Isaacs, President of

the arms control advocacy organization Council for a Livable World, "He

wants to deploy unproven missile defenses to protect the US and our allies.

 He failed to realize that our allies don't want it.  If President Bush

continues to push for deployment, missile defense will certainly ‘divide

us,'" added Isaacs.  



<p>French President Jacques Chirac has warned that missile defense could

"relaunch the arms race in the world."  German Defense Minister Rudolf

Scharping also argued that "The technical feasibility and the financing of

a strategic missile defense are not at all manageable yet."  Even Canadian

Prime Minister Jean Chretien signed a statement calling the 1972

Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which Bush has promised to abandon if

necessary for deployment, "a cornerstone of strategic stability."  Jonathan

Motzfeldt, Prime Minister of Greenland, may have summarized European

reaction when he said, "NATO has not greeted the NMD plans with cheers."



<p>Additionally, President Bush addressed the issue of defense spending today.

 In response to criticism that his $14 billion defense spending boost is

insufficient, President Bush ordered a immediate review of all Pentagon

programs last week, which is expected to be completed before he submits his

fiscal 2002 defense budget.



<p>In his speech President Bush may have provided some insight into what he

hopes will come out of the review.  While his critics argue there is not

enough money to pay for all of the weapons the Pentagon wants, Bush

countered by promising to buy weapons "judiciously" and "selectively."  He

spoke about the importance of precision guided weapons, unmanned systems,

and mobile forces.



<p>"The Pentagon is trapped in the Cold War," claimed Isaacs, "While the

Commander-in-Chief correctly talks of light forces and unmanned aircraft,

they plan to spend billions on 90-ton mobile howitzer cannons and three

different types of piloted fighter jets."
