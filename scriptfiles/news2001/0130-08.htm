- January 30 - Employing the new tools of cyber-activism, Defenders of Wildlife

today kicked off an innovative, Internet-based campaign featuring

a computer animation to raise public awareness about new threats

to the nation's last arctic wilderness refuge.

<p>"The animation -- starring a polar bear, her cub and an oil

driller -- illustrates the danger posed by oil exploration to the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the crown jewels

of America's natural treasures," Defenders of Wildlife President

Rodger Schlickeisen said.

<p>Narrated by actor Ed Asner, the video is displayed on the

Defenders' new Web site --<a href="http://www.SaveArcticRefuge.org">

www.SaveArcticRefuge.org </a>-- along with

a petition urging President Bush and Congress not to allow oil

drilling in the refuge. The animation was developed by

RealImpact(tm), which is a division of RealNetworks(r) that

provides high quality technical and creative services in Strategic

Consulting, Streaming Media, Web Site Design, to progressive

organizations. RealImpact can be found on the World Wide Web at

<a href="http://www.realimpact.net">www.realimpact.net.</a>

<p>"RealImpact(tm) is dedicated to helping progressive

organizations use the Internet as an advocacy tool. We have been

very pleased to partner with Defenders on this critical campaign to

keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge safe from drilling," said

RealImpact(tm) General Manager Eileen Quigley.

<p>With a click of a mouse, computer users can watch the animation,

which presents the story of a polar bear sleeping peacefully by her

cub when they are awakened by an oil man. The oil man eventually

drives the animals from their home by exploring for oil and then

drilling a well. At the end, the silhouette of a monstrous oil rig

is pounding away, and an oily set of polar bear tracks leads away

from the frozen landscape.

<p>The video concludes by urging viewers to sign the Defenders'

petition against oil drilling in the refuge. "Oil and wildlife

don't mix," Asner says on the video.

<p>Schlickeisen said Defenders of Wildlife hopes viewers will enjoy

the video and e-mail the Web link for it to their friends to spread

the word about the threat to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

<p>"We hope that, through this animation, we can send a very

serious message to President Bush and Congress," Schlickeisen said.

"Oil drilling would spoil the refuge, and we would lose our last

sanctuary for Arctic wildlife-all for a six-month supply of oil

that wouldn't be available for 10 years or more."

<p>"Big Oil is lobbying Congress to drill in the coastal plain of

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is America's

greatest wildlife sanctuary. Called America's Serengeti, it's home

to polar bears, muskoxen, wolves, millions of migratory birds,

caribou and hundreds of other species. The industrial disturbance

from oil drilling would be immense and spills are inevitable,"

Schlickeisen said. "Our petition is a way for citizens to make

their voices heard on this important issue."

<p>Defenders of Wildlife is known for its high-tech innovations.

The organization's Defenders Electronic Network (DEN) is an online

environmental advocacy tool that includes a free e-mail newsletter

called DENlines, plus email alerts when urgent action is needed.

Readers can subscribe to DENlines at<a href="http://www.defenders.org">

www.defenders.org</a>. On

behalf of a coalition of leading environmental groups, Defenders

sponsored the Web site <a href="http://www.SayNoToNorton.org">"SayNoToNorton.org,"

</a>which

generated

more than 100,000 e-mails and faxes to senators in opposition to

the nomination of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior.

<p><i>Defenders of Wildlife is a leading non-profit conservation

organization recognized as one of the nation's most progressive

advocates for wildlife and its habitat. With more than 750,000

members and supporters, Defenders of Wildlife is an effective

leader on endangered species and biodiversity issues.</i>
