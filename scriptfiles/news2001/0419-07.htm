- April 19 - Some of the biggest names in the environmental, labor and social justice movement are combining forces to organize the first annual conference to teach organizers and community groups how to take on big corporations. Scheduled for May 27-30 in Dallas, Texas, &quot;Empowering Democracy: Challenging Corporate Power and Demanding Accountability,&quot; will feature training workshops and plenaries, as well as keynote speakers Jim Hightower, Kevin Danaher of Global Exchange, Bob Massie of CERES and others.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prompted by the growing movement for corporate accountability to achieve political, social and environmental goals, the conference is being established to create a powerful training ground for organizations and to bring people engaged in corporate campaigns together on a regular basis. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;People all over the US and world are fighting against corporate power in its many forms, with little outside help. This conference is intended to help people take on corporate power in their communities and around the world by teaching the basic skills, strategies and tactics that work,&quot; said Molly Rooke, Conference Organizer. &quot;This is the only conference of its kind in the United States &shy;and the only one that exists where people can learn the day-to-day skills needed to fight corporate power.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Empowering Democracy will teach organizers how to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of their corporate targets, develop campaign strategies that will work, and train people in the many tactics and skills that a successful corporate campaign may draw upon. Participants will also put their new skills to work by joining in an action aimed at ExxonMobil, which has scheduled its annual meeting for May 30 in Dallas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A $125 registration fee covers meals and conference expenses for the three day event. Travel and lodging scholarships are available for those with limited resources. Registration and additional information is posted at www.empoweringdemocracy.org. The conference is being organized by the Corporate Campaign Working Group, assembled for the purpose of initiating an infrastructure to support and train corporate campaigners.</font></p>
