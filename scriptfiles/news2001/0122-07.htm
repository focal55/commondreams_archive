- January 22 - As the world's leading

climate change scientists envision a potentially more devastating

global warming in this century, the World Resources Institute (WRI)

urged President George W. Bush to rapidly move for the ratification

of the Kyoto Protocol and to resume the stalled talks to implement

the international climate protection treaty.

<p>The latest scientific report, Third Assessment Report of the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), was approved

today by climate change scientists from more than 100 countries in

Shanghai, China. It presents new and stronger evidence that most of

the global warming in the last 50 years was caused by human

activities. Global warming temperatures are also projected to

increase by 2.52 degrees F - 10.44 degrees F (1.4 degrees C

-- 5.8 degrees C) from 1990 to 2100, which is higher than the

estimates in the last IPCC assessment in 1995.

<p>"As the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, the U.S. has an

historic opportunity and a moral responsibility to jump-start the

stalled negotiations for the Kyoto Protocol," said Jonathan Lash,

WRI president. "Scientists have presented compelling evidence and

politicians must move boldly to mitigate the impacts of climate

change before it is too late."

<p>The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC also reveals:

<p>-- In the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s were the warmest

decade. 1998 was the warmest year since 1861.

<p>-- Snow cover has decreased by 10 percent since the 1960s in the

mid- and high altitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In the recent

decades, the thickness of the ice in the Arctic Sea has declined by

as much as 40 percent.

<p>-- Warm episodes of El Nino phenomena have been more frequent,

persistent, and intense since the 1970s.

<p>-- In parts of Asia and Africa, the frequency and intensity of

droughts have increased.

<p>-- Sea levels are expected to rise by 0.88 meters by 2100.

<p>"The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC is another warning

bell." said Dr. Anthony C. Janetos, senior vice president of WRI

and co-chair of a separate report, Climate Change Impacts on the

United States, released by the U.S. government late last year. "You

just need to look around the country to see what the rest of the

world is already experiencing in terms of climate change."

<p>The U.S. report warns climate change and the resulting rise in

sea level are likely to worsen threats to buildings, roads, and

powerlines in low-lying coastlines and the permafrost regions of

Alaska.

<p>It also says that certain ecosystems, like the alpine meadows

and some barrier islands, are likely to disappear. Other

ecosystems, like the forests of the Southeast, may break up or

their composition will change. "The goods and services lost through

the disappearance or fragmentation of certain ecosystems are likely

costly or impossible to replace," said Dr. Janetos.

<p>Dr. Nancy Kete, director of WRI's climate, energy and pollution

program, says that globally, climate change will have the greatest

impact on those with the least resources to adapt, especially

developing countries. For citizens of island nations and low-lying

countries like Bangladesh, there may simply be no place to retreat

as sea level rises.

<p>"One could argue that the U.S. and other industrialized

countries have imposed potentially catastrophic environmental

changes in the developing world," said Dr. Kete. "Although this

problem was created inadvertently, its consequences are now quite

clear. The responsibility to reduce carbon emissions -- either

through energy conservation or new, low-carbon energy sources --

lies with industrialized countries."

<p>While industrialized countries account for as much as 80 percent

of the build-up of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon

dioxide, none of them have ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

Negotiations in The Hague last November collapsed as the U.S. and

the European Union could not agree on how they can reduce their

emissions of greenhouse gases.

<p>"The political impasse in the climate negotiations over

relatively insignificant differences was like Nero fiddling while

Rome burned," Dr. Kete said. She hopes that the Third Assessment

Report of the IPCC will motivate the U.S. and leading industrial

countries to go back to the negotiating table and finish what they

started in Kyoto, Japan in 1997.
