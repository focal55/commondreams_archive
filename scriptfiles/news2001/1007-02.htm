<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 7 -  Following is a statement

by Peace Action and the Peace Action Education Fund on today's

military strikes by the United States against Afghanistan:

<p>Peace Action and the Peace Action Education Fund regret today's

U.S. military strikes against Afghanistan. We urge the president

to cease air strikes and refrain from an invasion by ground troops,

and instead to seek an end to terrorism through international legal

cooperation.

<p>Treating the heinous acts of September 11 as an act of war, and

waging war in response, will only escalate the violence and loss of

life. The terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, DC, and

Pennsylvania were criminal acts. The perpetrators of the crimes

should be brought to justice through the international legal

system.

<p>"We fear U.S. military attacks will lead to the deaths of more

innocent people, in Afghanistan, the U.S. and elsewhere.

Ultimately, Americans will be less, rather than more, secure as a

result of U.S. military attacks that began today," said Kevin

Martin, Executive Director of Peace Action and the Peace Action

Education Fund.

<p>"Peace Action and the Peace Action Education Fund mourn the loss

of those killed in the horrific September 11 attacks, and want to

see the perpetrators brought to justice through the international

legal system," noted Martin.

<p>Many family members of victims of the September 11 attacks,

including Jennifer Rice of our staff in California, have spoken out

against any retaliatory attacks by the U.S. We should be guided by

their lead in seeking justice, not vengeance.

<p>If we reflect for a moment, we know that violence will only

beget more violence. As Gandhi said, "There is no way to peace.

Peace is the way." Terrorism will only be defeated by a long-term

commitment to building democracy, respect for human rights, and

economic and social development in impoverished areas of the world.

<p>A remarkable movement calling for "Justice not War" and for

protecting the civil liberties of Arab-Americans and

Muslim-Americans has sprung up all over the country in the

aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Hundreds of rallies and

vigils have been held across the nation. Students on hundreds of

campuses have organized anti-war teach-ins.

<p>Today, October 7, thousands will participate in a previously

scheduled peace march in New York City, and supporting events have

been organized in cities around the country including Chicago,

Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Madison,

Wisconsin and dozens more.

<p>In addition to today's events, local Peace Action affiliates and

other peace groups will be organizing emergency anti-war

demonstrations within the next 24 hours all around the country.

<p><i>Peace Action is the country's largest peace and disarmament

organization with over 85,000 members. Peace Action and the Peace

Action Education Fund advocate peace, disarmament, social justice

and non-violent means of resolving conflict.</i></p>
