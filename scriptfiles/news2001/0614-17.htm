- June 14 - Tens of thousands of 

immigrants across the U.S. began a one-day fast today to draw 

attention to the need for immigration reform that gives hard-working 

immigrants who pay taxes and contribute to our economy an opportunity 

to earn U.S. citizenship. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Real immigration reform must provide legal status to 

hard-working, taxpaying immigrants in this country,&quot; said Andrew L. 

Stern, president of SEIU, the largest union in the AFL-CIO and the 

largest union representing immigrant workers. &quot;We don't need a new 

&quot;guest worker&quot; program; we need a &quot;legalized worker&quot; program for 

those who are already here.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stern and other U.S. union leaders recently met with Jorge 

Castaneda, foreign minister in Mexican President Vicente Fox's 

Cabinet, to discuss the need for immigration reform that makes it 

easier for hard-working immigrants to receive legal status. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), and U.S. 

Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), Bob Filner (D-San Diego), Diana 

DeGette (D-Denver) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Chicago) today attended a 

kick-off for the National Fast for Justice in front of the U.S. 

Capitol. Immigrants from more than a dozen nations are taking part 

in the 24-hour fast and vigil at the Reflecting Pool in front of the 

Capitol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fast is part of Justice for Janitors Day, which marks the 11th 

anniversary of the Century City police riot, in which striking office 

building janitors and supporters were brutally beaten by Los Angeles 

police. The incident marked a turning point in the nationwide Justice 

for Janitors movement. Since then, hundreds of thousands of mostly 

immigrant janitors have united for better wages and affordable health 

insurance by joining SEIU. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This summer, 20,000 janitors along the east coast, including the 

northern New Jersey suburbs of New York, the Philadelphia suburbs, 

Baltimore and Montgomery County, Md., are uniting in the Justice for 

Janitors 2001 campaign. Many of them are paid as little as $5.50 an 

hour without health benefits, and are threatened with deportation if 

they speak out for fair treatment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 1.4 million members, SEIU is the largest and fastest growing 

union in the AFL-CIO, and the largest union of immigrant workers.
