<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  

- November 9 - While the Bush 

administration pushes Congress to approve &quot;fast track&quot; trade 

negotiation authority, environmental and public interest groups 

filed suit today in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., 

against U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick for stonewalling 

public access to the U.S. negotiating position on the U.S.-Chile 

Free Trade Agreement. Zoellick was required, by July 25, 2001, to 

respond to a request for documents relating to the administration's 

plans to accept new international trade rules. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit was filed by Earthjustice on behalf of the Center 

for International Environmental Law, Friends of the Earth and 

Public Citizen. These groups are concerned that the new 

international trade rules could weaken U.S. and Chilean 

environmental and health standards. When they are released, the 

American groups plan to use the documents to provide input to U.S. 

negotiators regarding the agreement's environmental impacts, and 

will share them with sister public interest organizations in Chile 

also seeking democratic openness in trade rule making. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Time is of the essence here,&quot; said Stephen Porter, senior 

attorney with CIEL. &quot;The Administration is rushing to conclude 

negotiations by year's end, but is doing so behind a cloak of 

secrecy. If these trade deal are so important and will deliver the 

benefits their supporters claim, then why aren't they conducted in 

a public manner?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using the Freedom of Information Act, the groups asked USTR to 

disclose documents it provided to Chilean negotiators during 

meetings over the last two years to discuss provisions of the 

proposed trade agreement, including rules that would limit the 

ability of U.S. local and national governments to protect their own 

health standards and environmental protection laws. Similar 

investment protection provisions in the NAFTA have been the basis 

for a $1 billion dollar challenge to a California plan to phase out 

the use of the harmful gasoline additive MTBE and a $16 million 

dollar award to the U.S.-based Metalclad corporation after local 

Mexican government officials refused to authorize the company to 

build a hazardous waste facility that could have contaminated 

drinking water. Extending these rules in an agreement with Chile 

could further weaken the ability of the United States and Chile to 

protect the environment and human health. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Shrouding the negotiations in secrecy hardly gives the public 

confidence that U.S. trade negotiators have the interests of 

working American families at heart,&quot; said Mary Bottari, director, 

Harmonization Project of Public Citizen. &quot;One can only suspect that 

our trade negotiators are busily spreading NAFTA's problems to the 

rest of the hemisphere.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;USTR appears to be on the verge of replicating NAFTA's failed 

and discredited investment rules in new trade agreements, including 

the one with Chile,&quot; said David Waskow, trade and investment policy 

coordinator for Friends of the Earth. &quot;The public should be able to 

find out whether negotiators intend to give even more foreign 

investors the right to challenge environmental and public interest 

protections.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Transparency and public participation are hallmarks of 

democracy,&quot; said Martin Wagner, director of international programs 

for Earthjustice. &quot;If citizens are kept in the dark until 

negotiations are completed, they will never be able to provide 

useful advice concerning rules that would directly affect their 

lives and health. The important decisions happen early in the 

process. We are only left to wonder what they're trying to hide. 

Are U.S. trade officials giving foreign investors the power to 

overturn our health and environmental laws? The Bush administration 

won't say. We are suing for openness.&quot; </font></p>
