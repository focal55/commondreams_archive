- May 7 -  World Wildlife Fund is

leading a team of animal, plant and insect researchers into the

heart of the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in the Central African

Republic. Follow the scientists in the field from the WWF

website at <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/expeditions">http://www.worldwildlife.org/expeditions</a>

as they

plunge through the rainforests of the CAR to take a census of

animals from ants to elephants.

<p>All month long, the team will perform a biological inventory

of the reserve's wildlife and plant life, trudging through the

mud and fending off mosquitoes to analyze the threats and

opportunities facing one of the world's most important and

remote forest regions. Daily dispatches from the field will

give a feel of what it's like to actually be a part of the

scientific team.

<p>The Dzanga-Sangha Reserve is a jewel in the crown of the

Northwestern Congolian Lowland Forest Ecoregion, a WWF Global

200 site that spans parts of Gabon, The Congo Republic,

Cameroon, CAR and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The reserve

is one of the last remaining undisturbed lowland tropical

forests in Africa and home to one of the continent's largest

intact forest elephant populations. Also present are western

lowland gorillas, giant forest hogs, bush pigs, bongos, African

forest buffaloes and six species of duiker. Sixteen of CAR's 20

primate species exist here, ranging from dwarf galagos to huge

gorillas. It is also home to the BaAka pygmies, indigenous

hunter-gatherers who rarely grow taller than five feet. In

helping establish and protect the reserve, WWF works closely

with the BaAka on conservation, health and education programs.

<p>The expedition team consists of experts in mammals, primates,

birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and plants, as well as

local biologists and students who are being trained in

biological inventory techniques.

<p>The team will use a variety of assessment techniques

including mist netting, ultraviolet light trapping, Winkler bag

extraction of leaf litter, and recording of amphibian and

primate noises. The team will also use classic journalistic

"gumshoe" methods of questioning local people about the presence

of primates and other species in the area.
