- January 30 - Controversial Interior Secretary-nominee Gale A. Norton was confirmed by the Senate today on a vote of 75 to 24, but not before dramatically distancing herself from a public record that environmentalists declared antagonistic and incompatible with her obligations as interior secretary.   After waging a campaign to expose Norton&#146;s anti-environment beliefs and actions, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) today said that the environmental community&#146;s efforts succeeded in prompting Norton to moderate her views during the congressional testimony and to commit to making natural resource conservation her primary objective, a pledge to which environmentalists and Congress can now hold her accountable.

	 <p>&#147;Although we are disappointed that Gale Norton was confirmed as interior secretary, we are encouraged that 24 senators courageously opposed her nomination, twice the number that opposed the controversial nomination of James Watt to the same post in 1981,&#148; said LCV President Deb Callahan.  &#147;We had two objectives in this battle - first, to raise public awareness about her 20-year anti-environment record and second, to put her on notice that she will be under great scrutiny during her tenure as interior secretary.  Her record cannot simply be erased, or credibly disavowed, by six hours of moderate testimony.  Even some senators who voted for her made statements for the record indicating that her past anti-environmental actions clouded the prospects of her committing to her current responsibilities as interior secretary.&#148;</p>

	 <p>Under intense public pressure, Norton pledged during her confirmation hearing to uphold the nation&#146;s major environmental laws as written and currently interpreted - a major shift from her previous position that certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act and Surface Mining Act were unconstitutional.  She also dedicated herself to making conservation of America&#146;s resources her &#147;top priority.&#148;  Norton did however reiterate her support for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, a position strongly opposed by environmentalists and two-thirds of the American public.</p>

	 <p>According to LCV, the 24 senators who voted against Norton&#146;s confirmation deserve praise for making conservation and environmental protection their primary priority, which is exactly what the interior secretary, by the nature of the position, should be expected to do.  Disappointed by those senators who supported Norton&#146;s confirmation, LCV said those senators now bear much of the responsibility for holding Norton accountable to the commitments she made in the confirmation hearings.  The group challenged them to work with her when possible to promote conservation goals and oppose her efforts when necessary to protect natural resources and the environment.</p>

	 <p>&#147;Gale Norton now faces a test of whether her actions as interior secretary will reflect her words as a nominee,&#148; Callahan said.  &#147;We welcome working alongside her to make progress on our common priorities, such as full funding for conservation programs.  We will hold her accountable to the commitment to enforce our nation&#146;s most important environmental laws as written and currently interpreted.   Also, we will fight every effort by Norton or the Bush administration to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development, or to falsely link that oil development to the current California energy crisis.&#148; </p>

	 

<p><i>LCV is the political voice of the national environmental and conservation community and the only national organization working full-time to hold Congress, the president and administration officials accountable for their environmental actions. Through paid advertising campaign and grassroots mobilization, LCV informed congressional leaders and the public about Norton&#146;s anti-environment record.
