- May 17 - While energy consumers are subjected to rolling

blackouts in California, all Americans are subjected

to a permanent blackout when it comes to the closed-door

activities of the National Energy Policy Development

Group headed by Vice President Cheney.  According to

press reports, not even Congress has full knowledge

of who is serving on this task force, or a full

accounting of this secretive body&#146;s activities.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The task force&#146;s modus operandus does not inspire

confidence and many of the task force&#146;s recommendations

&#150; like easing environmental protections to benefit the

oil and gas industry &#150; are what you would expect.  Big

time donors get major league payback, non-donors get

higher energy bills and a dirtier environment.

  

The President and Members of Congress have been very

successful at drilling for political contributions

from the energy sector.  In the 2000 election cycle,

the oil and gas sector contributed $15.4 million in

soft money contributions to the national political

party committees; electric utilities contributed $10.1

million more.  One company alone, Enron, gave more

than $1.4 million in the last cycle and recently

sponsored a major party fundraiser.  It certainly

raises questions about Vice President Cheney&#146;s contention

that conservation is &#147;not a basis for a sound,

comprehensive energy policy.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And these big donors must have been really pleased by

President Bush&#146;s dubious claim that the best way to meet

the energy crisis is to cut taxes, so that Americans

will be better able to pay their higher energy bills!

The much-vaunted tax cut is, after all, just a revenue

shift to the energy sector with the taxpayer playing

the role of middle-man.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taxpayers or anyone else who may feel left out of this

secretive process may have another chance, however:

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will be holding a

private, closed-door briefing on energy policy next

Thursday.  This being Washington, all you need is a big

check made out to the National Republican Senatorial

Committee to attend.</font></p>
