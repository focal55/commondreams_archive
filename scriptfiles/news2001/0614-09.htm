- June 14 - The final conclusion on climate change, leaked to Greenpeace, of the EU/US summit shows that George W Bush has failed the American people and walked away from the USA's commitment to save the climate by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace believes that the Bush administration's isolationist policy will ultimately fail, both domestically and internationally. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the first international environment agreement that the US has walked away from, and a very profound domino to fall,&quot; said Michel Raquet, Greenpeace International climate spokesperson. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We ask again that the EU here at this meeting declare publicly and strongly that it will ratify the Kyoto Protocol without the US, now that Bush has abandoned his country's responsibilities to the international climate agreement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The EU must respect public opinion and prove that they are listening to the people who voted them into power and ratify the Protocol with or without the USA by the end of the year,&quot; said Raquet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>EU-U.S. Joint Statement <br>

G&ouml;teborg, Sweden </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">14 June 2001 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">23. We had an interesting and open dialogue here in G&ouml;teborg on climate change, which will continue. We recognise that climate change is a pressing issue that requires a global solution. The EU and the US are both committed to providing strong leadership on climate change and agree on the importance of intensifying co-operation on climate-related science and research. Prompt, effective and sustainable action is needed, consistent with the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">24. We are determined to meet our national commitments and our obligations under the UNFCCC through a variety of flexible means, drawing on the power of markets and technology. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">25. We disagree on the Kyoto Protocol and its ratification, but we are determined to work together in all relevant fora to address climate change and will participate constructively in the resumed COP 6 in Bonn. </font></p>
