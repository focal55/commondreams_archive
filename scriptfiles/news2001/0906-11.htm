<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 6 - After more than three years of investigations, litigation and

intensive lobbying, the Justice Department today announced it

would no longer seek a break-up of the computer giant Microsoft,

ending one aspect of a landmark case that sent the company's

campaign contributions soaring and formally introduced the

computer industry to Washington politics.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision by the Bush administration to vacate the lawsuit

that was first initiated in 1998 by the Clinton Justice

Department is considered a major victory for Microsoft, which

nearly tripled its campaign contributions and more than doubled

its lobbying expenditures during its fight against the antitrust

case.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 1999-2000 election cycle, Microsoft contributed more

than $4.7 million in soft money, PAC and individual

contributions to federal candidates and parties--almost three

times what the company contributed during the previous three

election cycles combined. More than two-thirds of that money

went to Republicans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush campaign reported $61,250 in contributions from

Microsoft employees during 1999-2000. Attorney General John

Ashcroft, a former U.S. Senator from Missouri, reported just

$9,250 in contributions from Microsoft during the last

elections, though the company did contribute $10,000 to the

Ashcroft Victory Committee, a soft money account run jointly by

the Ashcroft campaign and the National Republican Senatorial

Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But that's not all the money that Microsoft has thrown around

Washington in recent years. During the calendar year 2000 alone,

Microsoft spent almost $6.4 million to lobby Congress and the

Clinton administration, according to reports filed with the U.S.

Senate. That's a significant increase over the $4.9 million in

lobbying expenditures the company reported in 1999. And

Microsoft also was a major contributor to the Bush-Cheney

Inaugural Fund, donating $100,000 to the gala last January.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just months into the 2001-02 election cycle, Microsoft already

ranks as a significant contributor, giving just over $700,000 to

federal parties and candidates, split almost evenly between the

two major parties. (This includes contributions reported through

the end of July.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the lawsuit's most significant impact on campaign

finance extends beyond Microsoft itself. The antitrust lawsuit

proved to be a major turning point in the tech industry's

involvement in Washington politics. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shortly after the Justice Department launched its lawsuit,

Microsoft became one of the first computer companies to open

lobbying offices in Washington and was one of the first to

contribute major soft money dollars to the political parties. By

the year 2000, computers and Internet companies ranked No. 7 on

the list of the biggest industry givers on the federal level,

contributing more than $39.7 million. Since 1997, Microsoft has

been the industry's biggest contributor.</font></p>
