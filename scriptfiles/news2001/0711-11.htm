- July 11 - Commercial Alert warned parents today about a new corporate predator,

NetworkNext, which uses high schools to gather market research from

teenagers, and pitch products to them, without parental consent.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The company boasts to advertisers of an &quot;audience of one million teens

in 1,000 schools,&quot; and the ability to &quot;test the impact of changes in

online interactive marketing variables&quot; on high school students which

&quot;puts business and marketing decision information at your fingertips.&quot;

With its mobile computer and projection equipment that it provides to

schools, the company says it displays banner ads in classrooms

&quot;continuously...for the entire class to view.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NetworkNext wants to turn the schools into billboards, shopping malls

and market research extractors,&quot; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of

Commercial Alert, a group that opposes commercialism. &quot;This company

shows how corporate America will stoop to anything to shake loose a few

more dollars from the nation's kids.  Schools are for learning, not

commercial bombardment or corporate spying.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The company, which says it is &quot;in the e-commerce and Internet

advertising business,&quot; tells advertisers that they can receive &quot;Total

online purchase behavior of teens,&quot; including the ability to &quot;track the

dynamics of online consumer purchasing&quot; by students.  It boasts of a

&quot;unique viewing environment&quot; &#150; the schools &#150; &quot;that helps sponsors

increase awareness, usage and purchase intent.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These invasive advertising and market research practices have no place

in schools,&quot; Ruskin said. &quot;We urge parents to swiftly eject this company

from the schools.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The company features, among other things, an iCanCharge.com debit card. 

&quot;It is not the proper role of the schools to promote charge cards and

materialism to impressionable teenagers,&quot; Ruskin said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to an article in today's Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the company

plans its &quot;national rollout&quot; in September.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NetworkNext is following a string of failed high-tech strategies for

commercial exploitation of schoolchildren.  Commercial Alert, Obligation

Inc. and Junkbusters ran a campaign that helped lead to the demise of

the ZapMe! Corp., a similar company that advertised and gathered market

research from schoolchildren.  Similar public outrage forced another

company, N2H2 Inc., to announce that it would stop gathering market

research from schoolchildren.  A third company, HiFusion, stopped

collecting market research from schoolchildren and was purchased by

Mindsurf.

 

On June 14th, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the &quot;Student Privacy

Protection Act,&quot; sponsored by Senators Richard Shelby (R-AL) and

Christopher Dodd (D-CT), that would require parental consent before a

company could extract market research from a child in school.  The

measure is pending in a House-Senate conference committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NetworkNext says it has &quot;participating schools&quot; in Atlanta, Baltimore,

Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston,

Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia,

Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, St.

Louis, Tampa, and Washington DC.</font></p>
