- June 25 - With the Associated Press reporting Monday afternoon that "the United States has withdrawn a complaint with the World Trade Organization over a law used by Brazil to ensure

cheap drugs to fight AIDS," public health advocates are assessing the implications. The following policy analysts are available for interviews:

<P><LI>MARIA LUISA MENDONCA, <A HREF="mailto:maisa@globalexchange.org">maisa@globalexchange.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.global.org.br/english">www.global.org.br/english</A><BR>

Director of the Global Justice Center in Brazil, Mendonca said today: "As we saw in the

U.S. case against South Africa, the U.S. and the drug companies didn't have a

case. Brazil was being challenged by the U.S. at WTO, but Brazil was actually

following even the unfairly pro-patent WTO rules. Pressure from civil society

seems to have helped compel the U.S. to back off this political case."

Mendonca, who two months ago appeared as a guest on the PBS "NewsHour with

Jim Lehrer" to discuss trade issues, can be interviewed in English.

<P><LI>JAMIE LOVE, <A HREF="mailto:love@cptech.org">

love@cptech.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cptech.org">www.cptech.org</A><BR>

Director of the Consumer Project on Technology, Love said today: "The U.S. government

should not insist on supervising a nation's day-to-day administration of its

patent laws.... We have to respect national sovereignty, and, in the case of

Brazil, let Brazil continue its difficult and costly efforts to treat poor AIDS

patients."

<P><LI>PAUL ZEITZ, M.D., <A HREF="mailto:pzeitz@earthlink.net">

pzeitz@earthlink.net</A>, <A HREF="http://www.un.org/ga/aids">www.un.org/ga/aids</A><BR>

Co-director of the Global AIDS Alliance, Dr. Zeitz has worked for 10 years in Africa as a public health specialist. He said today: "The government of Brazil implemented a

program to deliver anti-viral drugs to its population using generically

manufactured drugs. This had a major effect in reducing AIDS." Dr. Zeitz

is at the current UN conference on AIDS

<P><LI>ARTUR KALICHMAN, M.D., <A HREF="mailto:artur@crt.saude.sp.gov.br">artur@crt.saude.sp.gov.br</A><BR>

Dr. Kalichman is the coordinator of the Sao Paulo AIDS Program. In a statement to the Institute for Public Accuracy on Monday afternoon, responding to the U.S. government's

decision to drop its complaint, he said: "It's very good news. Brazil

wants to guarantee that our population will get the medicine. Our primary goal

is not to fight against the United States or the pharmaceutical industry, but

to guarantee the access of the population of the patients who need the drugs to

get retroviral therapy at an affordable price.... When the prices of the

medicines go down, Brazil will buy the medicines." Dr. Kalichman, who has

a master's degree in public health, can be interviewed in English.

<P><LI>ROBERT WEISSMAN, <A HREF="mailto:rob@essential.org">

rob@essential.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.essential.org">www.essential.org</A><BR>

Co-director of Essential Action and author of the article "Who Will Control the AIDS

Fund?" in the current issue of <I>The Nation</I>, Weissman said today:

"Whatever its motivations, the U.S. complaint against Brazil sent an

outrageous message to the rest of the world: Authorizing compulsory licensing

-- even if never actually issuing a compulsory license -- will get you in a

legal tangle with the United States. The dismissal of the case that never

should have been filed is therefore an enormous step forward. But only time,

and the example of a country proceeding to issue a compulsory license without

U.S. interference, will fully repair the damage."
