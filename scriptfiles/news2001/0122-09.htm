- January 22 - The following was

released today by the National Abortion Federation:

<p>-- Bush Marks Roe vs. Wade By Reinstating Global Gag Rule

Limiting Vital Reproductive Health Care Services

<p>-- Association of Abortion Providers Criticizes Bush

Administration for Playing Politics with Women's Lives

<p>President Bush's move to impose restrictions on international

family planning will deny countless women and families worldwide

access to vital reproductive health care services, according to

the National Abortion Federation. "Today, Bush has sent another

clear message to the American people that he is willing to

sacrifice women's health to score political points with the

religious right," said Vicki Saporta, executive director of the

National Abortion Federation (NAF). "The vast majority of

Americans support international family planning. In fact, the

majority of Americans who voted for President in the past

election voted for a pro-choice candidate. Today's action is

out of step with the wishes of mainstream America."

<p>For many years, international family planning funds have not

been used to provide abortion services. They are instead used

to provide a variety of reproductive health care services to

women and families. Shortly after he took office in 1992,

President Clinton rescinded a gag rule imposed under previous

Republican administrations that prohibited organizations

receiving the funding from providing abortion services or

counseling about abortion with their own funds. President

Bush's action today reinstates that gag order.

<p>"We know that worldwide almost 80,000 women die each year

from illegal, unsafe abortion. It is deeply troubling that on

this day when we celebrate the Roe v. Wade decision that has

saved the lives and health of countless women in America,

President Bush has decided to take a step that jeopardizes the

lives and health of women around the world."

<p>Saporta also criticized recent statements by the Bush

administration, including Secretary of Health and Human Services

nominee Tommy Thompson, indicating a willingness to impose

restrictions on the use of mifepristone, or RU-486, for early

abortion. "The safety and efficacy of mifepristone has already

been established by the FDA. Politics prevented women from

accessing mifepristone before it was finally approved this fall,

and now it seems that politics could once again deny women's

ability to access this safe early abortion option."

<p>Saporta stated, "All Americans should be deeply concerned

that President Bush's extremist actions in the last few days in

no way match his moderate rhetoric from the campaign."

<p><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional

association of abortion providers in the US and Canada dedicated

to ensuring that abortion remains safe, legal and accessible. </i>
