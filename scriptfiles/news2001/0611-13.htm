- June 11 -  <P><LI>RICHARD MORAN, <A HREF="mailto:rmoran@mtholyoke.edu">

rmoran@mtholyoke.edu</A> <BR>

Professor of sociology and criminology at Mount Holyoke College, Moran is currently working

on a book about the death penalty. He has testified at dozens of death penalty

sentencing hearings. Moran said today: "McVeigh was unapologetic because,

like many murderers, he viewed his killing as evening the score. The death

penalty is generally not a deterrent, but in the case of a McVeigh, it's almost

an encouragement; it has enhanced his status as a martyr. Most murderers

believe in an eye for an eye, which is the mindset we adopt when we invoke the

death penalty.... With the talk of the need for 'closure,' vengeance has become

a legitimate goal of punishment and revenge a central focus of the debate on capital

punishment. This is not just about McVeigh, or about the victims, it's about

our values as a society. People were shocked when McVeigh called children he

killed in the Oklahoma City bombing 'collateral damage' -- but he got that term

from the Gulf War, in which he fought. We trained him to kill."

A lawyer for the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project, which monitors all federal

death penalty cases, Bruck has specialized in capital cases since 1980. He has

successfully argued against the death penalty in four cases before the United

States Supreme Court. Bruck helped obtain a life sentence for Susan Smith after

she was convicted of drowning her two small children.

<P><LI>ROSE BRAZ, <A HREF="mailto:rosebraz@aol.com">rosebraz@aol.com</A>,

<A HREF="http://criticalresistance.org">www.criticalresistance.org</A><BR>

Director of Critical Resistance, a national organization opposing the expansion of the

prison-industrial complex, Braz said today: "It is ironic that when you

have so many people questioning the death penalty -- with innocent people who

have spent years on death row being found not guilty, with revelations of

inadequate legal representation, with the Republican governor of Illinois

placing a moratorium on executions -- the federal government has moved to have its

first execution in nearly 40 years. While states usually restrict the death

penalty to murder cases, the federal death penalty is very expansive -- it can

be used for drug charges and treason."
