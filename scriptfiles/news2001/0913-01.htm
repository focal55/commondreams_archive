- September 13 - <P><LI>FRANCIS BOYLE, <A HREF="mailto:fboyle@law.uiuc.edu">

Professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, Boyle said

today: "According to the facts in the public record so far, this was not

an act of war and NATO Article 5 does not apply. President Bush has

automatically escalated this national tragedy into something it is not in order

to justify a massive military attack abroad and an apparent crackdown on civil

liberties at home. We see shades of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which the

Johnson administration used to provide dubious legal cover for massive

escalation of the Vietnam War."

Editor of <I>The Progressive</I> magazine, Rothschild said today: "President Bush said that

America was targeted 'because we embrace freedom.' Not knowing with any

certainty who the attackers were, it's hard to speculate on their motives. But

many groups in the Third World have grievances that are more specific than the

ones Bush mentioned.... The Pearl Harbor analogy has frightening connotations.

Two months after Japan's surprise attack, the U.S. government rounded up

Japanese Americans into internment camps. Now it seems highly improbable that

Arab Americans or Muslim Americans will be rounded up, but what does seem quite

possible is that the media's obsessive focus on a non-differentiated Islamic

fundamentalism -- mixed in with nativist sentiment that is always on the shelf

-- will create a cocktail of hate crimes."

A national board member of Peace Action, Masri said today: "In Raleigh, N.C. -- where I

live -- the local mosque received two bomb threats the day of the attack. The

Islamic School in Raleigh had to close -- due to fear for its students' safety.

People driving by the mosque have been spewing racist statements -- such as

'sand niggers go home' and 'death to you all.' Several Arab women wearing Hijab

had stones thrown at them from passing cars, and have been spat on at the main

university campus. In pockets across the U.S. and Canada, the verbal threats

have become direct physical assaults."

Professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, Cole said today: "In the past we

have responded to acts of terrorism by clamping down on basic civil liberties,

by anti-immigrant actions, and by engaging in unjustified and widespread guilt

by association.

Director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, Birns said today: "The Senate is ducking

its responsibility in today's pro forma confirmation hearings on John

Negroponte as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. No public witnesses

are being heard. While the Bush administration has professedly become an

apostle of democracy, it has selected one of the most tainted figures of the

Central American wars of the 1980s to be its ambassador to the UN."
