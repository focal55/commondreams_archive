- June 14 - <a href="http://www.womenonwaves.org/" target="new">Women on Waves</a> arrives 

today in Dublin, Ireland, where abortion is illegal, to provide 

abortion and reproductive health services to women on a specially 

equipped ship. The Feminist Majority Foundation's (FMF) National 

Clinic Access Project staff is currently providing technical 

expertise in contemporary threat management and is assisting in the 

development and implementation of security protocols for the 

vessel. FMF is assisting the Dutch ship, led by Dr. Rebecca 

Gomperts, and donating time, staff and resources to ensure the 

safety of the staff, crew, and women patients aboard the sailing 

clinic. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are concerned about the threats and violence of 

anti-abortion extremists, especially Americans who we know have 

traveled to Ireland,&quot; said FMF President Eleanor Smeal. &quot;Charles 

Kopp, the alleged assassin of Dr. Barnett Slepian, was in Ireland 

shortly before he was arrested in France,&quot; added Smeal. &quot;We not 

only hope to protect the ship, its staff, crew, and the women 

aboard who seek reproductive health services, but we think this 

will open up an important dialogue about illegal abortions and the 

impact they have on women's lives around the world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Irish Family Planning Association, more than 

6,000 Irish women traveled to Britain to obtain abortions last 

year. It is unknown how many others attempt at-home abortions or 

seek unsafe, illegal abortions. The United Nations estimates that 

80,000 women and girls worldwide die annually from complications 

resulting from botched, illegal abortions. Women's health and 

feminist organizations estimate the number to be greater than 

200,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Margaret M. Moore, FMF director of law enforcement operations, 

has been working with community volunteers and professional hired 

security in Ireland for several weeks, training them to assess 

threats of violence and implement specialized security plans. She 

has also served as a liaison with local Irish law enforcement in an 

effort to curb any potential violence and ensure safety around and 

aboard the ship. Moore will be in Ireland assisting security 

operations this week and will be available for interviews. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Feminist Majority Foundation runs the National Clinic Access 

Project, the nation's largest and oldest clinic defense project, 

providing emergency clinic security, assistance, and community 

organizing support, monitoring anti-abortion extremists, and 

working with law enforcement to improve responsiveness to clinic 

violence. The Anti-Abortion Violence Watch is published monthly 

and sent to law enforcement and media to inform and educate them 

about the threats posed by anti-abortion extremists. The project 

has conducted the most comprehensive annual nationwide social 

science survey of anti-abortion violence at women's health clinics 

for the past eight years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="http://www.womenonwaves.org/" target="new">Women on Waves</a> is a non-profit organization concerned with 

women's human rights. Its mission is to prevent unwanted pregnancy 

and unsafe abortions throughout the world. The Dutch vessel will 

provide non-surgical abortions, contraception, counseling, and 

other services. Working in close cooperation with local 

organizations, Women on Waves wants to respond to an urgent medical 

need, empower women to exercise their human right to reproductive 

health, and draw public attention to the consequences of unwanted 

pregnancy and illegal abortion. </font></p>
