- April 9 - Few Americans feel they understand, let alone have any sayover, the intricate forces that determine whether their lights go on. In

today's energy system, we  have become utterly dependent on distant

power plants,  long-haul transmission lines, and unaccountable

decision-makers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To regain reliability and peace of mind, according to a new book

published by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance  (ILSR), citizens

must take charge of their electrons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Seeing the Light: Regaining Control of our Electricity System, author

and national energy expert David Morris describes the changing

technological and political context of the debate over energy policy,

and offers actual rules and  strategies that will shift both generating

capacity and  decision-making authority to the local level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For those who want to know what is wrong with our electricity system

and how to fix it, Seeing the Light is a must read,&quot; says U.S. Senator

Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Morris outlines the steps necessary to develop a flexible network of

small-scale power plants, including microturbines, fuel cells, and

renewable generators. Indeed, consumers and communities have already

begun to move in this direction. Seeing the Light points out how many

cities and states, in the wake of California's energy crisis, are

redefining their electric futures in ways that achieve not only

reliability and low cost, but social and environmental goals as well.

Texas is rewriting its rules to encourage a new generation of on-site,

small-scale power plants. Ohio has enacted legislation that encourages

cities to become electricity buyers for their residents. Sacramento and

Los Angeles have embraced a decentralized power approach focused on

rooftop solar cells.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the power plants of the 21st century will not flourish until cities

and states adopt new rules that reject both the top-down regulated

utility model of the past and the out-of-control deregulation of today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seeing the Light also describes how citizens are taking back control

over their distribution and transmission grids. Customer-owned utilities

are increasingly seen as a means of avoiding the risks of deregulation

while still capturing its promises: lower costs, better service, and

genuine customer choice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Policy makers and customers are looking to regain control over their

electricity system, bringing power, both literally and figuratively, to

the people,&quot; writes Morris.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Seeing the Light can be ordered for $15 directly from the ILSR's New

Rules Project web site at <a href="http://www.newrules.org/">http://www.newrules.org/</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Institute for Local Self-Reliance is a 26-year-old nonprofit

research and educational organization supporting environmentally and

economically sound local communities. As a companion to the book, ILSR

has created a section of the New Rules Project web site at

<a href="http://www.newrules.org/electricity/">http://www.newrules.org/electricity/</a> that gives users the tools to

become active participants in designing a new electricity system.<br>
