- June 7 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sunday, June 10, a 2 p.m. rally in Lafayette Park across from 

the White House will register widespread public opposition to 

the Bush administration's push for a national missile defense 

(NMD). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGO leaders, journalists, activists, political humorists and 

members of Congress opposing NMD will speak, missile placards, 

banners and other visuals protesting the new NMD arms race will 

be displayed in front of the White House. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally kicks off three days of citizen activism in 

Washington against NMD, sponsored by a broad- based coalition of 

national citizens' groups with combined membership of over 

100,000. The groups include Women's Actions for New Directions, 

Physicians for Social Responsibility , Peace Links, Global 

Security Institute, Peace Action, and The Nation Institute. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent days some 40,000 e-mails, 6,000 signatures and over 

10,000 snail-mailed messages opposing NMD have poured into 

Washington, and mail continues to arrive at the rate of over 

1000 a day. Hundreds of constituents from 30 states are also 

traveling to Washington to urge their representatives against 

NMD on June 11 &amp; 12. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They argue that the Bush administration's missile defense 

plan is costly, unworkable, destabilizing, will trigger a new 

arms race, weaponize space and enrich defense contractors while 

endangering Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;You can't make lemonade out of this lemon,&quot; says WAND 

director Susan Shaer. &quot;Missile defense, no matter what President 

Bush calls it, will waste billions of dollars and still not make 

us safer from terrorists.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Polls show the more Americans learn about NMD, its costs and 

strategic consequences, the more strongly they oppose it. 

Defense Secretary Rumsfeld is in Brussels now, where he is 

expected to reveal more details of NMD architecture to an unreceptive meeting of NATO defense ministers, while new polls 

at home show President Bush's disapproval rating creeping up to 

58 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rally and the other &quot;Stop the New Arms Race&quot; events take 

place leading up to President Bush's June 12 departure for the 

EU and Moscow summits, where for the first time he will face 

European and Russian opposition to NMD first hand, but where he 

cannot legitimately argue a majority of Americans solidly 

support his NMD proposal, organizers say. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers at the June 10 rally will include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TBA <br>

-- Tracy Moavero, Peace Action <br>

-- Rev. John Dear, formerly of Fellowship of Reconciliation <br>

-- Barry Crimmins, political satirist/humorist <br>

Educators for Social Responsibility <br>

-- Bruce Gagnon, Global Network against Weapons and Nuclear

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 12 at 12:30pm in the House side press triangle behind 

the Capitol building, a dozen members of Congress will join &quot;Stop the Arms Race&quot; organizers and Frank von Hippel, Federation 

of American Scientists Chairman and former Assistant Director 

for National Security of the White House Office of Science and 

Technology, for a press conference showing their opposition to 

the Bush NMD agenda. Control of key Senate committees which will 

make decisions on NMD funding and deployment went to Senate 

Democrats this week in the wake of Senator Jeffords' party 

switch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">June 12 is the day President Bush leaves for Europe and 

Russia to press his NMD proposals, with this send-off from NMD 

opponents at home. June 12 is also the anniversary of the 

largest demonstration in American history, a 1982 rally in New 

York's Central Park where a million demonstrators protested the 

nuclear arms race and galvanized a national movement against 

Ronald Reagan's Star Wars initiative. In a May 22 article &quot;Bush 

Plan for Missile Shield Reviving Anti-Nuclear Movement&quot; Cox Newspapers reported on the June 10-12 &quot;Stop the Arms Race&quot; 

events and other signs that a broad-based groundswell of citizen 

opposition to the Bush NMD initiative is emerging today. </font></p>
