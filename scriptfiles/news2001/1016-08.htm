- October 16 -   The Violence Policy 

Center (VPC) today applauded the decision of the U.S. Court of 

Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Emerson. In 

reversing a lower district court ruling, the judges rejected the 

argument that the Second Amendment guarantees domestic abusers an 

individual right to keep and bear arms and that the plaintiff, 

Timothy Joe Emerson, was denied due process when arrested for 

possessing firearms under 1994's federal Protective Order Gun Ban. 

The VPC is a national non-profit organization working to stop gun 

death and injury in America. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mathew Nosanchuk, VPC litigation director and legislative 

counsel states, &quot;Today the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected 

the sweeping arguments of the gun lobby that the Second Amendment 

guarantees domestic abusers an individual right to possess a gun. 

Final score: public safety, one; gun lobby and domestic abusers, 

zero.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Timothy Joe Emerson, a Texas resident, had been charged with 

violating 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8), which prohibits possession of a 

firearm by persons under a domestic violence restraining order. 

Emerson's wife obtained such an order from a judge in 1998, after 

Emerson had acknowledged his mental instability. Two months later 

Emerson's wife and daughter went to his office, where Emerson 

pulled his Beretta pistol from his desk drawer during an argument. 

Emerson was subsequently indicted for illegally possessing two 9mm 

pistols, a semi-auto SKS assault rifle with bayonet, a semi-auto 

M-14 assault rifle, and an M1 carbine and tried in District Court. 

Emerson contended that his case should be dismissed on the grounds 

that the federal ban on gun possession by those under a protective 

order for domestic violence violated the Second Amendment. The 

district judge sided with Emerson and dismissed the charges. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Justice Department prosecutors then appealed the trial court's 

decision, stating that it directly conflicted with long-established 

legal precedent regarding the Second Amendment laid down by the 

U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Miller (307 U.S. 174 (1939)) 

as well as the language of the Second Amendment itself, which 

speaks in terms of a limited right to keep and bear arms in 

connection with service in a state militia. </font></p>
