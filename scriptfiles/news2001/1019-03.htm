- October 19 - The Sierra Club today applauded a new General Accounting

Office (GAO) report exposing the U.S. Forest Service's financial

mismanagement of America's National Forests.  The GAO attempted to

investigate how much money taxpayers lost by subsidizing logging on our

National Forests, but was stymied by what it called the Forest Service's

&quot;totally unreliable&quot; accounting practices.&quot;

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Forest Service mismanages our National Forests so badly that

government investigators can't even figure out how much of our tax money

they're losing,&quot; said Sean Cosgrove, Sierra Club's forest policy

specialist.  &quot;The billions of tax dollars lost on timber industry logging

would be much better spent restoring our damaged National Forests.  Reading

this report on the Forest Service's gross mismanagement, the only sensible

conclusion is to end commercial logging in America's National Forests.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March 2000, Representatives Cynthia McKinney (D-Georgia) and George

Miller (D-California) requested that the GAO investigate how much money the

U.S. Forest Service's Timber Sales Program lost in 1998 and 1999.  After a

year and a half of investigation, the GAO concluded: &quot;ultimately it was the

serious accounting and financial reporting deficiencies that existed at the

Forest Service during fiscal years 1998 and 1999 that precluded us from

making an accurate determination of the total federal costs. ... These

deficiencies rendered the Forest Service's cost information totally

unreliable.&quot;  (GAO-01-1101R Forest Service Timber Costs)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A previous GAO study of data from 1992-1997 found that the Forest Service

lost $2 billion in tax money subsidizing timber industry logging in our

National Forests.  As logging in our National Forests continues, taxpayers

continue to lose money.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans love to take their families hiking, hunting, fishing and

birdwatching in our National Forests, and these forests provide clean

drinking water to 60 million people,&quot; Cosgrove said.  &quot;But no one wants to

take their kids hiking through a clearcuts, and communities can't drink

water from a stream polluted by logging roads run-off.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's 155 National Forests draw 835 million visitors a year to their

4,400 campgrounds, 121,000 miles of trails and 96 wild-and-scenic rivers.

Some 10,000 different plants and 3,000 kinds of fish and wildlife --

including 230 endangered species -- rely on National Forests for habitat.

A study conducted last year by the independent economic analysis firm

ECONorthwest found that recreation in America's National Forests generates

25 times more income for the U.S. economy than does logging on those lands.

The Sierra Club's campaign to end commercial logging on our National

Forests is committed to protecting America's wild heritage for our families

and for our future.
