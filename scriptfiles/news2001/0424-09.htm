- April 24 - The Global AIDS Alliance

(GAA) joins today with partners who are calling for immediate

cancellation of outstanding debt by the World Bank (WB) and the

International Monetary Fund (IMF) in heavily indebted poor

countries who are affected by HIV/AIDS.

<p>"With thousands of Africans dying each day -- and over two

million Africans projected to die this year from HIV/AIDS, it is

the profound responsibility of President Bush to ensure that the

IMF and the WB act now to stop this holocaust. Debt cancellation by

the WB and IMF, using their own institutional resources, is an

essential step that will allow African countries to build the

public health and social infrastructure that is necessary to combat

HIV/AIDS," said GAA Co-Director, Dr. Paul Zeitz.

<p>"We strongly endorse the 'Debt Cancellation for HIV/AIDS

Response Act of 2001' that was introduced to the 107th Congress

this week by Congresswomen Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters. We hope

that there will be a strong bipartisan support for this critical

legislation. We are calling on President Bush to move beyond

rhetoric into bold action against the AIDS in Africa crisis," said

Zeitz.

<p>The GAA is calling for a three-pronged campaign to accelerate

action to reverse the global HIV/AIDS pandemic: First, the GAA is

calling on Bush to enact a $2.5 billion dollar emergency

supplemental appropriation to combat AIDS in Africa this year.

Second, the GAA is calling on Bush to invest in a global bulk

procurement system to provide lifesaving medications at the lowest

cost; Third, the GAA is calling on Bush to use the voting power of

the United States to instruct the WB and IMF to implement complete

multilateral debt cancellation in countries affected by HIV/AIDS

using their own resources.

Network, Constituency for Africa, Drop-the-Debt Campaign, Health
