- March 20 - More than a quarter of the

population in the Los Angeles area is uninsured. Indigent

populations in California, along with ethnic and racial

minorities, face more severe health problems than privileged

populations.

<p>California's health care infrastructure -- the safety net --

is stretched to the breaking point. At the same time, the

nation's medical schools are not admitting enough minorities to

create a diverse workforce for the future and fail to train

future physicians to be culturally sensitive to an ever-diverse

patient population.

<p>These issues and others will be addressed at the American

Medical Student Association (AMSA) 51st Annual National

Convention, set for March 28-April 1 at the Disneyland

Hotel in Anaheim, Calif. The theme of AMSA's convention is "Take

the Challenge! Student Action for Zero Health Disparities."

Nearly 2,000 premedical and medical students, international

medical students, residents and interns, physicians (including

AMSA alumni), and other activists from across the country will

gather for five days of innovative workshops, inspirational

keynote addresses and organizational policymaking.

<p>AMSA was founded in 1950 to provide medical students a chance

to participate in organized medicine. In the 1960s, the

association refocused its energies on the problems of the

medically underserved, inequities in our health-care system and

related issues in medical education. Since 1968, AMSA has been

a fully independent, student-led organization.

<p>AMSA continues to be an activist organization, with its

members providing more than 1 million person-hours of community

service every year. Over 300,000 physicians began their medical

careers by participating in AMSA programs, and many of those

activist students have moved on to become leaders within the

medical community. For more than 30 years, AMSA has been

dedicated to the principle that health care is a basic human

right.

<p>Keynote Addresses

<p>"Besides the very interesting and stimulating seminars and

workshops, we are thrilled to have a great slate of speakers,"

said Sindhu Srinivas, M.D., AMSA's national president

(2000-2001). Keynote speakers will include: Christopher Elias,

M.D., founder of Programs for Appropriate Technology in Health

(Wed., 3/28); Rear Admiral Kenneth P. Moritsugu, M.D., M.P.H.,

U.S. Deputy Surgeon General, (3/29); Neil Shulman, M.D., author

of 'Doc Hollywood,' which was made into a motion picture with

Michael J. Fox (Fri. 3/30); local Los Angeles U.S.

Representative Maxine Waters (Sat., 3/31); and America Bracho,

M.D., a Santa Ana physician and founder of Latino Health Access

(Sun., 4/1).

<p>"Eliminating Health Disparities: A Challenge for Us All."

<p>As part of AMSA's national convention, a series of plenary

sessions will be held debating and discussing various aspects of

the larger issues of universal health care and disparities in

health care. The four sessions will feature experts from various

fields to present informative and serious discussions with

convention attendees.

<p>-- Faces of Medicine: A Mirror for Medical Students: Medical

students representing a broad cross-section of the

underrepresented groups spectrum-women, disabled, ethnic and

racial minorities, and gay, lesbian and bisexual students --

will introduce and discuss different disparities, biases and

interactions that occur within medicine during the first plenary

session scheduled for March 30, at 11:00 a.m.

<p>-- Fair Practices: Patient Protections: Dr. Quentin Young,

one of the nation's foremost health reform activists, will

moderate a panel of patients from different local California

communities discussing their own experiences and interactions

with physicians and the health care system during the second

plenary session set for Friday, March 31, at 1 p.m. Dr.

Young will then lead an interactive discussion about the

importance of universal access to health care in the fight to

eliminate health disparities.

<p>-- Affirmative Action: Will it Stay or Fade Away? The issue of

recent drawbacks on affirmative action policies and the impact

on admissions to medical schools will be addressed during a

plenary session set for Saturday, March 31, at 11:30 a.m.

<p>-- Eliminating Health Disparities: Making it Happen: Dr.

Nathan Stinson, director of the Office of Minority Health at the

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will lead a

discussion about the emerging realities of health disparities in

our nation and the necessity for medical student activism during

the fourth and final plenary session set for Sat., March 31, at

2:30 p.m.

<p>Convention Programming

<p>The program also includes many other workshops and seminars

for those attending the convention. "With titles ranging from

'Finding Synergy Between Relationship-Centered Care and the

Striking Progress of Biomedical Science and Technology' and 'The

Black Biomedical Research Movement: An Effort to Develop a

Functional Relationship between Medical Professionals and their

Black Patients' to 'Update on the Tobacco Wars' and 'No Free

Lunch: The Physician-Pharmaceutical Company Relationship'"

Srinivas says, "there will be numerous panels, discussion

groups, focus groups, and clinical skills sessions during the

five days of this convention that will enlighten, inspire and

complement traditional medical education."

<p>AMSA's House of Delegates

<p>As AMSA's official policy-making body, the House of Delegates

is a delegation of AMSA members from each local medical chapter

who meet once a year at the Annual Convention to vote on AMSA's

policies and to elect national officers. The HOD is open to all

members of AMSA to speak and vote. Members debate the issues,

make amendments and cast votes that shape AMSA's policies. Most

importantly, any member of AMSA has the right to write and

submit resolutions to the House of Delegates. This year, AMSA's

HOD will debate policies on issues such as collective bargaining

and physician unionization, pass-fail grading at medical schools

and tuition concerns, and the use of non-violent direct action

as a strategy for activism.

<p>Exhibit Hall

<p>One of the highlights of AMSA's 51st Annual National

Convention is the 100-booth exhibit hall. Exhibitors include:

book publishers, specialty societies, residency training

programs, test preparation services, medical device companies

and advocacy organizations. There are no designated areas for

specific groups, so expect a good mix of product and service

exhibitors that medical student attendees can tap for many of

their needs.

<p>National Awards

<p>On March 20, at 9:30 a.m. (approx. preceding Dr.

Moritsugu's address), AMSA will recognize The University of

Southern California (USC) School of Medicine for their

commitment to admitting a diverse medical student population, in

response to the troubling crisis in America regarding health

disparities faced by racial and ethnic populations. At the same

time, the nation's medical schools are failing to admit enough

underrepresented minority students and incorporate cultural

competency training in order to best serve our ever-diversifying

population. In response to these twin dilemmas, AMSA created

this "model school recognition" to highlight and distinguish a

medical school that is exemplary in the area of admitting a

diverse medical school population to serve their community.

<p>On Friday, March 30, at 9 a.m., AMSA will honor Helen Davies,

Ph.D., assistant professor of medicine at the University of

Pennsylvania College of Medicine, with its 2001 National Golden

Apple for Teaching Excellence Award. AMSA established the local

Golden Apple Award many years ago to give AMSA chapters an

opportunity to honor excellence in medical teaching at their

schools. Because of its increasing popularity, AMSA established

a medical teaching excellence award on the national level. The

National Golden Apple Award recognizes a medical professor whose

exemplary teaching achievements advances the profession of

medicine and contributes to the educational welfare of medical

students. Nominations are made and reviewed entirely by medical

students.

<p>On Saturday, March 31, at approximately 10 a.m. (following

an address by Rep. Maxine Waters), AMSA will award the 2001 Paul

R. Wright Excellence in Medical Education Award to the

University of Florida College of Medicine for excellence in the

integration of end-of-life/palliative care education into the

medical education curriculum. This is AMSA's most prestigious

award, named after its current executive director. AMSA

established the PRW Award to annually recognize a medical

school, chosen by the nation's medical students, whose exemplary

achievements in medical education best foster the development of

socially responsive physicians. Each year, the area of

concentration reflects a different dimension of medical

education.

<p>On Sunday, April 1, at 11 a.m., AMSA, along with the Gay and

Lesbian Medical Association will present the 3rd Annual Lesbian,

Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgendered (LGBT) Health Achievement Award to

the Sexual Orientation Medical Awareness (SOMA) and Lesbian,

Gay, Bisexual People in Medicine (LGBPM) groups at the

University of Pennsylvania College of Medicine. AMSA and GLMA

established the LGBT Health Achievement Award to recognize a

medical school, student group or individual student for

exemplary achievement in promoting the inclusion of LGBT health

issues or concerns within medical school.
