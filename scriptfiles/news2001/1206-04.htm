- December 6 - The Alliance for Justice 

today joined members of Congress to denounce efforts by the gun 

lobby and gun manufacturers to use the events of September 11 to 

increase gun ownership in America. Alliance for Justice's 

student-led Gun Industry Watch will lead a campaign to counter 

these efforts. &quot;It's time the gun industry stop exploiting tragedy 

to sell guns,&quot; said Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron. 

&quot;Flooding our streets with deadly weapons will not honor the memory 

of the victims of September 11, it will only create new victims of 

senseless violence.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alliance for Justice's Gun Industry Watch kicked-off a billboard 

campaign in Los Angeles to counter similar advertisements run by 

the California Rifle and Pistol Association (NRA affiliate) urging 

people to arm themselves for safety. The billboard reads: &quot;Society 

is safer when criminals don't know who's armed.&quot; When questioned 

about the appropriateness and timing of the message, a spokesman 

said it was &quot;truer than ever&quot; and &quot;in light of what happened in New 

York City, people have stopped taking for granted their own 

security.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We condemn the efforts of the gun lobby and gun makers to 

exploit people's fears and prejudices to increase gun ownership,&quot; 

said Aron. &quot;It was this blatant attempt to exploit people's 

anxiety and fear that first convinced us to launch a 

counter-campaign educating the public as to the dangers of bringing 

a gun into the home.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gun Industry Watch research found that gun manufacturers are 

also using the events of September 11 to sell weapons. Three 

examples offered at today's press conference: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Beretta is selling the &quot;United We Stand&quot; pistol with a 

percentage of proceeds to go to victims of September 11. The 

company lists the NYPD and the Survivors Fund of the National 

Capital Region as the charities they will donate money to. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ithaca Gun is selling a &quot;Homeland Security&quot; model rifle. The 

company gives a patriotic sales pitch to consumers: &quot;In our 

current time of national need Ithaca Gun is ready to meet the 

challenge...In every respect, these new Homeland Security Model 

shotguns are up to the demanding tasks which lay before us as a 

nation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Finally, a gun manufacturer called Tromix is publicizing a 

soon-to-be-released 50 caliber rifle nicknamed the &quot;Turban Chaser&quot;. 

The announcement on the company's website is accompanied by an 

American flag design. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bigotry and exploitation are not American values,&quot; added Aron. 

&quot;And there's nothing patriotic about flooding our streets with 

lethal weapons.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gun Industry Watch's student network will also be educating the 

public about the dangers of guns in the home through letter writing 

campaigns, protests, op-eds, leafleting, and other activities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining Aron at today's press conference were Reps. Henry Waxman 

(D-Calif.) and Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.). </font></p>
