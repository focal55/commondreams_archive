- October 9 -  Political Research Associates (PRA) is celebrating its 20th year of providing information on the Right with an anniversary gathering to be held from 6pm - 8:30pm on Friday, November 9 at the Abiel Smith School in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood.  Margaret A. Burnham, partner in the law firm of Burnham &amp; Hines, and Dr. Loretta Williams, Director of the Gustavus Myers Program for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights will co-host the event.  </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Founded in 1981 as Midwest Research in Chicago, PRA has become a leader in research on the Right and right-wing groups.  &quot;What began as Midwest Research in Chicago with three staff has become a widely -respected leader in research and publications on right-wing efforts to limit justice and equality,&quot; said President Jean Hardisty, Ph.D., who established the organization. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our 20th anniversary is a great occasion to highlight PRA's history of alerting the progressive movement to dangerous right-wing initiatives,&quot; noted Director Kate Cloud. &quot;We're proud of our work as a national information resource for activists, journalists, educators, policy makers and the general public. It is needed now more than ever.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

The evening will feature brief remarks by Dr. Hardisty and an opportunity for supporters to meet with staff as well as view the exhibits of the school's museum.  Other celebrations to benefit the center's programs are planned for New York City, and Chicago, IL.</font></p>
