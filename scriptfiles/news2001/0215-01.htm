- February 15 -  Today Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and

Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) will introduce the Global Democracy Promotion

Act of 2001, legislation that would prevent the United States from

imposing undemocratic and dangerous restrictions on health

providers overseas. Representatives Nita Lowey (D-NY) and Nancy

Johnson (R-CT) will introduce matching legislation in the House

when it returns from recess. Both pieces of legislation are

co-sponsored by more than 40 members of the House and Senate from

both parties.

<p>Senator Boxer and Representative Lowey developed the legislation

in response to the "global gag rule," imposed by President George

W. Bush on Jan. 22, 2001 -- the 28th anniversary of the landmark

Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. The rule reinstates the

Reagan-era Mexico City policy, which denied U.S. funding to any

foreign non-governmental organizations that provides abortion

services, counseling or referrals, or lobbied to change abortion

laws.

<p>"We are supporting the Global Democracy Promotion Act because we

believe that providers and advocates understand better than anyone

the health needs of a community," said Gloria Feldt, president of

the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. "Restrictions like

this create a culture of fear among those best equipped to address

the health needs of women and their families around the world."

<p>By imposing the "global gag rule," President Bush interferes

with the doctor-patient relationship, and the sovereignty of other

nations. The rule requires foreign health care providers to

withhold critical medical information from their patients, as a

condition of receiving U.S. funding.

<p>"In this country, such a rule would be considered an intolerable

intrusion into the sacred relationship between health care provider

and patient," remarked Feldt.

<p>Beginning Feb. 15, Feldt will visit a number of cutting-edge

reproductive health and adolescent health programs in Kenya and

Uganda. Members of the media can learn more about the programs and

people that will be affected by the global gag rule by following

Feldt on her journey. Daily updates will be available on

<p><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the world's largest

and most trusted voluntary family planning organization. It

comprises 127 affiliates that operate 875 health centers

nationwide, which serve nearly five million Americans annually.
