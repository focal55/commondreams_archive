- February 7 -  The National Council of

Women's Organizations (NCWO), in partnership with seven of its

national member organizations, will convene a Summit on Women and

Social Security on Feb. 8 to launch a coordinated opposition to

Social Security privatization. More than three hundred leaders of

grassroots organizations representing all fifty states will

participate in the two days of meetings, training workshops, and

Congressional office visits. The attendees will deliver a unified

message to Capitol Hill: Individual Accounts carved-out of Social

Security will hurt women and families. The conference has been

called because national women's groups are concerned that

privatization would necessarily jeopardize the guarantee of

lifetime, inflation-adjusted benefits that Social Security now

provides.

<p>Speakers will include:

<p>-- Rep. Robert Matsui (D-CA), Ranking Member, Subcommittee on

Social Security of the Ways &amp; Means Committee, U.S. House of

Representatives

<br>-- Beth Kobliner, Financial Journalist and Commentator

<br>-- Heidi Hartmann, Ph.D. Chair, Women &amp; Social Security Task

Force, and President, Institute for Women's Policy Research

<br>-- Patricia Ireland, President, National Organization for Women

<br>-- Dean Baker, Ph.D., Co-Director, Center for Economic and

Policy Research

<br>-- Marilyn Moon, Ph.D., Senior Fellow, Urban Institute

<br>-- Martha Burk, Ph.D., Chair of the National Council of Women's

Organizations, and President of the Center for Advancement of

Public Policy

<br>-- Joan Entmacher, Vice President, National Women's Law Center

<br>-- Kilolo Kijakazi, Senior Policy Analyst, Center on Budget and

Policy Priorities

<br>-- Deborah Briceland-Betts, Executive Director, OWL

<br>-- Cindy Hounsell, Executive Director, Women's Institute for a

Secure Retirement

<p>"Most workers will face cuts in guaranteed benefits that are not

made up by income from an individual account," according to Heidi

Hartmann, Ph.D., President of the Institute for Women's Policy

Research and Chair of the NCWO Women and Social Security Project.

"If privatizers keep their promises to current retirees-younger

workers will get less when they retire."

<p>"The majority of the more than 100 organizations in NCWO are

extremely concerned about Social Security privatization," added

Martha Burk, Ph.D., Chair of NCWO. "The Women &amp; Social Security

Summit will mark an important milestone in the effort to preserve

the guaranteed benefits of Social Security that millions of

Americans-women in particular-depend on."

<p>The event will be cosponsored by Business and Professional

Women/USA, the American Association of University Women, OWL, the

voice of midlife and older women, the National Council of Negro

Women, the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement, the National

Organization for Women, and the Feminist Majority. The Summit

Advisory Committee includes the Institute for Women's Policy

Research, the Center for Advancement of Public Policy, the National

Women's Law Center, the National Committee on Pay Equity, and the

YWCA of the USA. The goal is to engage citizen activists in the

debate and to build support for addressing gender inequities in the

current system.<p>

<i>The National Council of Women's Organization's (NCWO) is a

non-partisan, non-profit coalition of more than 115 women's

organizations across the nation collectively representing over six

million women. For years, NCWO has convened the leadership of major

women's organizations dedicated to focusing on national issues and

public policy agendas affecting women. In 1998, NCWO formed the Women

&amp; Social Security Project and launched a national education campaign

to highlight Social Security's importance to women.
