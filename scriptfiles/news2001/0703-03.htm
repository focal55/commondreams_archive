- July 3 - While the military budget will increase by $33 billion next year, the

Bush administration wants to cut Defense Department Cooperative Threat

reduction Programs by $40 million— from $443 million to $403 million. Also

referred to as the Nunn-Lugar program, these programs assist the countries

of the former Soviet Union in dismantling their thousands of nuclear

warheads and strategic delivery systems left over from the Cold War. 



<p>When added to $100 million of already requested cuts to Department of

Energy non-proliferation programs, the administration plans to cut a total

of $140 million from this vital effort in fiscal 2002. 



<p>The cuts run contrary to the recommendations of a bipartisan task force led

by former Senator Howard Baker (R-TN) and former White House Counsel Lloyd

Cutler. In January 2001 the task force concluded that Russia's massive

stockpiles of nuclear weapons, plutonium and highly enriched uranium pose

the "most urgent unmet national security threat to the United States

today," and recommended investing $30 billion over eight to ten years to

eliminate the threat. 



<p>Nunn-Lugar has deactivated over 5,000 nuclear warheads and destroyed

hundreds of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), missile silos,

submarine-launched ballistic missiles, bombers, and nuclear test tunnels

since 1991. 



<p>"Nunn-Lugar has been one of the most cost-effective investments in U.S.

security since the end of the Cold War," said Steve LaMontagne, an expert

on non-proliferation at Council for a Livable World Education Fund. 



<p>On the other hand, missile defense programs will receive $8.3 billion in

2002, an increase of $3 billion over the amount that former President

Clinton had proposed. The increase comes despite the system's poor test

record and potentially destabilizing impact on global security. 



<p>"To reward a system that has failed two out of three tests with an extra $3

billion, while at the same time cutting funds for programs with bipartisan

support and a proven record of success, is illogical and dangerous,"

commented LaMontagne.



<p>"It looks like Nunn-Lugar has been sacrificed on the altar of the

administration's faith-based missile defense," added John Isaacs, President

of Council for a Livable World.
