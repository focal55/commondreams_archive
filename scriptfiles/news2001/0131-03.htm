- January 31 - George W. Bush's plan to set up a massive federal aid

                    program for &quot;faith-based&quot; charities is drawing

                    increasing fire from religious, civil rights, civil

                    liberties and labor groups.

                    <p>In

                    a Jan. 30 joint letter to Bush, 19 national organizations

                    warned that the proposal raises &quot;constitutional and

                    policy concerns&quot; and urged the president to forbid

                    religious discrimination at faith-based agencies that accept

                    federal funds.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Specifically,&quot;

                    the groups said, &quot;we seek your commitment that your

                    proposals will make clear that religious institutions that

                    receive public funding for the provision of social services

                    may not discriminate when employing people in taxpayer

                    funded positions based on an applicant's religion or the

                    religious beliefs of the employer.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Signers

                    of the letter included the NAACP, the Leadership Conference

                    on Civil Rights, Americans United for Separation of Church

                    and State, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National

                    Education Association, the American Counseling Association

                    and the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.</p>

                    <p>The

                    Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United

                    for Separation of Church and State, said concern about the

                    Bush &quot;faith-based&quot; plan is growing, even among the

                    religious leaders.</p>

                    <p>&quot;The

                    Bush proposal is sparking a firestorm of controversy,&quot;

                    said AU's Lynn. &quot;I don't think President Bush knew how

                    much opposition there would be from so many different kinds

                    of groups across the spectrum.&quot;</p>

                    <p>At

                    a press conference yesterday, leaders from the Catholic,

                    Protestant and Jewish communities criticized the president's

                    proposal. They warned that it violates church-state

                    separation and puts needy people at risk of religious

                    pressures when they seek government help.</p>

                    <p>Lynn

                    noted that Bush is now having to work hard to try to recruit

                    support for his plan. Today he met with representatives of

                    Catholic Charities. Many religious leaders, however, are

                    worried about the Bush concept.</p>

                    <p>&quot;Bush

                    is meeting strong resistance to his sales pitch on

                    this,&quot; said Lynn.&nbsp; &quot;Many religious leaders

                    are very uncomfortable with the idea that they should

                    compete with each other for a slice of the funding

                    pie.&quot;</p>
