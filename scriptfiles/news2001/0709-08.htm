- July 9 - The Bush Administration's decision to delay important managed care regulations is a blow to patients, and contradicts the President's stated support for meaningful patient protections. It is ironic that on the very same day the President is visiting a D.C. area hospital to promote patient protections, his subordinates are busy denying such protections by delaying this rule. If the Administration were serious about protecting patients, the President would stop talking about patient protections and start providing them. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This important rule lays out the terms by which plans must make benefit decisions and individuals can appeal those decisions. It ensures the right to a speedy and fair internal review by the health plan, including faster initial decisions and faster decisions on appeal. Under this rule, patients also have more time to appeal a health plan's decision, 180 days rather than the current 60 days. The rule also requires full disclosure of the plan's claim procedures, specific reasons for denials, and access to all documents, records and all other information needed to guarantee that the review is meaningful. This rule provides a very basic protection for patients in managed care - something the President himself claims to want. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protections in this rule are the result of a long and deliberate rulemaking process over more than four years. While we are hopeful that patients' rights legislation will pass this year, we also know from experience that this bill may take some time before it is enacted. Why delay this rule when the Administration can make these basic protections immediately available to millions of Americans? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration's decision to issue notice of this delay without providing for the usual public comment period further denies Americans their Constitutional right to participate in the rule-making process. This action shows once again that this Administration is more concerned about protecting the interests of big business than it is in protecting patients. </font></p>
