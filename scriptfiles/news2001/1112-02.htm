<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- November 12 - A letter was delivered to 

House and Senate leaders this morning, signed by 50 American Nobel 

laureates, urging Congress not to fund or build missile defense 

because it will squander resources needed to protect Americans 

against terrorism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As President Bush prepares to discuss with Russian President 

Putin a deal that would allow the U.S. to build missile defenses, 

and just as news broke of a commercial airliner crashing into 

Queens, New York, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg 

released the letter at a Washington press conference sponsored by 

the Federation of American Scientists. The letter argues missile 

defense fails to address the real threats facing Americans. 

Weinberg spearheaded the Nobel laureates' letter together with Hans 

Bethe. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The tragic events of September 11 eliminated any doubt that 

America faces security needs far more substantial than a 

technically improbable defense against a strategically improbable 

Third World ballistic missile attack,&quot; the letter states. &quot;Devoting 

massive effort and expense to countering the least probable and 

least effective threat would be unwise.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have real threats we have to defend against,&quot; Dr. Weinberg 

said today. &quot;We need to help the Russians get rid of their excess 

material that could make nuclear weapons. We need to radically 

improve our hospitals' ability to deal with biological attack, and 

so forth. To starve these programs of the funds they need, while at 

the same time spending huge amounts on a missile defense that wont 

defend us against any plausible threat, indicates a lack of 

seriousness about protecting our national security.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As today's plane crash in New York underscores, terrorist 

ballistic missiles are not the pressing threat to U.S. security,&quot; 

said Robert Sherman, director of the Strategic Security Project at 

the Federation of American Scientists. &quot;The attempt to build 

missile become irrelevant in the post-Cold War environment of 

terrorist threats and asymmetric warfare. We now need to put our 

resources where we are most vulnerable and our enemies are most 

capable.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Previous attempts at a national missile defense have collapsed 

as it became evident that performance was much lower and cost much 

higher than advertised,&quot; Nobelists warn in the letter to 

Congressional leaders. &quot;We see no evidence systems currently being 

put forward will meet or merit a different fate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Nobel laureates are also critical of the Administration's 

hostility towards the ABM Treaty and other important arms control 

agreements, which they say risks undermining vital 

non-proliferation efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out 

of terrorist hands. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the Nobel prize, Dr. Weinberg was awarded the 

National Medal of Honor by President Georger H. W. Bush. A former 

consultant to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and a member 

of the elite JASONS group which advises the US government on 

defense policy, Weinberg's bestselling book &quot;The First Three 

Minutes&quot; on the origin of the universe is published in 22 

languages. </font></p>
