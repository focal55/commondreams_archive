- July 13 -  On Wednesday, the Bush Administration announced that it would

pursue a multi-layered Star Wars missile defense system and they

would withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, in the words

of Defense Sec. Donald Rumsfeld, "within months, not years."

<p>Citing the Administration's announcement that it would push

forward with deploying Star Wars regardless of whether it passes

Saturday's test, Scott Lynch, communications director of Peace

Action said, "When it comes to rewarding his friends in big

business, Bush has proven that no one does it better. The

truth is Star Wars is huge business, the contractors are huge

political contributors, and Cheney, Hadley and Rumsfeld are working

the revolving door with the Star Wars industry. Is it any wonder

that Lockheed Martin, Boeing, TRW and Raytheon continue to get

billions of our tax dollars."

<p>Lynch continued, "Despite the fact that the various Star Wars

systems have swallowed over $80 billion and have failed,

spectacularly, for over twenty years, Bush now wants to throw even

more money at it. Just this week, Bush asked for a 40 percent

increase in funding (for a total of $8.3 billion) for this faulty,

dangerous boondoggle that could cost taxpayers up to a trillion

dollars. The line needs to be drawn on political patronage. The

Bush Administration is prepared to risk a nuclear arms race so that

their big campaign contributors can continue living off the

government handouts."

<p>Peace Action is calling on the Senate Majority Leadership to

hold hearings to investigate the Administration's plan to replace

the proven arms control treaties. These treaties have reduced the

nuclear danger for over 40 years. The administration admits that

Star Wars will be neither able to prevent nor able to stop a

nuclear attack in the foreseeable future.

<p>Lynch added, "It should be noted that at no point has Bush

called for abolition of nukes -- i.e., he does not believe his own

rhetoric about moving away from MAD. So let's say twenty-five years

from now, we have a multi-layered system that is 95 percent

effective against ICBMs in combat situations. The world that has

proliferated nukes to the point where virtually every country with

a couple of PHDs in physics has the bomb. Terrorists are sneaking

nukes into our country the same way that drugs flow into our

country. Are we safer? I don't think so."

<p>Lynch concluded by saying "Ultimately, the problem with Star

Wars is that it destroys the arms control framework that has been

making progress on nuclear threat reduction for over 40 years and

replaces it with nothing. The way forward is to continue

multilateral efforts towards the reduction and abolition of nuclear

weapons, control of fissile materials and control of missile

technologies."

<p>As part of Peace Action's Star Wars is a Lemon campaign,

chapters around the country will be sending 300,000 Star Wars is a

Lemon postcards to the Senate. These cards will ask the Senators

to oppose funding for deployment of Star Wars. The Lemon campaign

will also be using print and TV ads aimed at legislators.

<p><i>Peace Action, formerly Sane/Freeze, organizes for the abolition

of nuclear weapons, an end to the international arms trade and a

redirection of U.S. tax dollars from the Pentagon budget to

domestic investment. Peace Action is the nation's largest

grassroots peace and disarmament organization with 85,000 members

nationwide.
