- June  4 -  In the first lawsuit

challenging the Bush Administration's unlawful rollback of final

regulations issued by the Clinton Administration, the Violence

Policy Center (VPC) today filed suit in federal court in the

District of Columbia against Attorney General John Ashcroft. The

suit alleges that Ashcroft has illegally suspended a final Justice

Department regulation implementing the Brady Law's National Instant

Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearm purchases. The

regulation gives the FBI the ability to combat abuse of NICS by

conducting periodic security audits of electronic records in NICS.

These audits are essential to ensuring that NICS is not being

defrauded in ways that allow felons, fugitives, and other

prohibited persons to obtain firearms. Although the published

regulation was thoroughly considered and finalized during the

previous administration, Ashcroft has twice delayed and suspended

the Final Rule's implementation without affording an opportunity

for comment.

<p>In its complaint, the VPC asserts that Ashcroft -- relying on

the Bush Administration's policy of summarily delaying final

regulations from the previous administration -- violated the

Administrative Procedure Act, the principal federal law that gives

all interested parties the right to participate in the regulatory

process. Ashcroft stopped the Final Rule from going into effect

without allowing the public its right to notice and comment.

Rather, the Attorney General, who belongs to the NRA and opposes

gun control, appears to be doing the NRA's bidding by taking steps

intended to reverse longstanding Justice Department policy as

embodied in the NICS Final Rule. Recently, the NRA's top lobbyist

boasted that Ashcroft is conducting a "top-to-bottom" review of

NICS. The VPC's suit seeks to bring Ashcroft's policy shifts into

broad daylight with a court order requiring him to take immediate

steps to implement the NICS Final Rule.

<p>"Attorney General Ashcroft's decision to suspend the NICS Final

Rule confirms our worst fears about the fate of federal gun policy

in John Ashcroft's Justice Department," stated Mathew Nosanchuk,

VPC litigation director and legislative counsel. "Unfortunately,

the Attorney General's illegal action, combined with his letter to

the NRA endorsing a view of the Second Amendment that openly

conflicts with existing Justice Department policy, proves that the

fox is guarding the henhouse when it comes enforcing laws to keep

prohibited persons from getting guns. This delay shows that Mr.

Ashcroft's interests lie with the NRA, not with the safety of the

American people," Nosanchuk added.

<p>The Violence Policy Center is represented by Virginia A. Seitz

from the Washington, D.C. office of Sidley, Austin, Brown &amp; Wood.

Last month the VPC launched <a href="http://www.ashcroftgunwatch.org">www.ashcroftgunwatch.org</a>,

the leading

source of ongoing information on Ashcroft, his pro-gun activities

and gun lobby ties, as well as his enforcement of current gun laws.

<p><i>The Violence Policy Center is a national non-profit educational

organization working to stop gun death and injury in America. For
