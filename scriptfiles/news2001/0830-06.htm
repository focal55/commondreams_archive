<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 30 - The Sierra Club today launched a website called &quot;I want

my MPG&quot; which helps car owners to plug in their make and model and

determine their annual fuel costs and savings if the miles per gallon (MPG)

standards are raised. The website is at

<a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/iwantmympg/" target="_new">http://www.sierraclub.org/iwantmympg</a></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;MTV exploded onto our TVs 20 years ago when the MPG standards were set,&quot;

said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director. &quot;But fuel economy standards

haven't been updated since the days of Captain &amp; Tennille - even though the

technology exists to create cars that use less fuel, save money at the

pump, and produce less global warming and air pollution. Our website shows

that each car owner could save hundreds of dollars with higher miles per

gallon standards and we could save the planet too.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The website is similar to a blue book and has mpg information on almost

every make and model of car. A visitor can enter the cost of gas in their

neighborhood and find out how much money they could save if MPG standards

are raised. In addition to the mpg calculator, the website features

animation of a disgruntled car highlighting the fact that technology for

auto fuel economy has stagnated since the mid '70s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, if you own a 16.8 mpg Ford Explorer you spend $1600 on gas but

if the MPG was raised, the Explorer would get 33 mpg, saving you $790 each

year on gas</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House of Representatives voted down a bill this July that would have

raised the fuel economy standard of SUVs and light trucks to the same level

as cars over the next 6 years. Increasing the fuel economy of automobiles

not only saves consumers money but is the biggest single step the United

States can take to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and the threat of

global warming. Over 40 percent of the oil we use in this country goes into

cars and trucks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Getting more miles out of a gallon of gas means saving consumers money at

the gas pump, lessening our dangerous reliance on oil, lowering levels of

carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution, reducing pressure to drill in sensitive

environments, enhancing energy security. Raising the miles per gallon

standard would save more oil than can be derived from the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Everyone should make their voice heard,&quot; continued Pope. &quot;Auto makers

won't act unless Americans stand up and say &quot;I want my MPG!&quot;&quot;
