- October 24 - The following is a 

statement by Joe Theissen, executive director, Taxpayers For Common 

Sense on the economic stimulus package: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This $160 billion economic stimulus package is heavily skewed 

toward long-term tax breaks for those who least need them and will 

negatively impact the long-term fiscal health of our nation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill that passed the U.S. House 216-214 late this afternoon 

is thoroughly inconsistent with what experts consider effective 

federal policies to increase economic activity. The initial call 

for a highly targeted, short-term stimulus, and the bipartisan 

understanding reached among the Budget Committees leaders earlier 

this month was that any economic stimulus package should be 

temporary. With so much of the revenue loss in this legislation 

occurring in future years, budget surpluses -- and with them the 

future of the economy -- are put at increased risk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill passed today will do virtually nothing to stimulate the 

economy. The debate today is less about economics and more about 

payback for the big tax breaks that corporations did not get 

earlier this year with President Bush's tax cut. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An effective stimulus package needs to do one thing -- leverage 

and increase consumer spending and confidence. Unfortunately, this 

bill fails to address those needs. Instead, lawmakers have decided 

that it is more important to give some of the largest corporations 

billions in new tax breaks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS) is a non-partisan voice for 

American taxpayers. TCS is dedicated to cutting wasteful spending 

and subsidies in order to achieve a responsible and efficient 

government that lives within its means. </i></font></p>
