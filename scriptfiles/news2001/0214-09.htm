- February 14 - Congressman Tom Lantos (D-California), Ranking Democratic Member of the 

House International Relations Committee, today introduced the &quot;East Timor 

Transition to Independence Act.&quot; This legislation would support 

democracy-building efforts in East Timor and assist the East Timorese 

people prepare for independence through $30 million in financial support 

and through other assistance. The bill is co-sponsored by 24 Members of 

Congress, including Representatives Patrick Kennedy (D-Rhode Island), Chris 

Smith (R-New Jersey), and Mark Kirk (R-Illinois). Senator Edward Kennedy 

(D-Massachusetts) also plans to introduce similar legislation in the Senate 

soon.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Eighteen months ago, the people of East Timor lived in fear. Having voted 

overwhelming for independence, they suffered violent persecution at the 

hands of rampaging militias aided and abetted by the Indonesian military. 

Today, their fear has been replaced with hope, thanks in part to strong 

leadership by the United States, Australia, Portugal, the World Bank, and 

the United Nations. By playing an important role in the diplomatic effort 

to end the violence and by supporting international efforts to secure the 

peace, the United States and our international partners helped give 

democracy a chance in East Timor,&quot; said Congressman Lantos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Although Americans can be proud of our contribution to peace in East 

Timor, our work is far from done. U.S. leadership is again needed to 

complete the victory of democracy in East Timor. Institutions of 

self-government have yet to take root, economic prosperity has yet to 

materialize, and the perpetrators of past human rights abuses have yet to 

be brought to justice,&quot; continued Congressman Lantos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The legislation I am submitting today provides critical moral and material 

support to East Timor as its prepares for independence later this year. 

This bill outlines a trade, aid, and security agenda enabling the people of 

East Timor to fulfill their dream of democratic self-governance. Having 

helped deliver the people of East Timor from repressive rule, America has a 

responsibility - and a strong national interest - in finishing the job of 

building democracy,&quot; Congressman Lantos concluded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, the East Timor Transition to Independence Act authorizes $30 

million in bilateral U.S. assistance to promote civil society, independent 

media, job creation and economic development, reconciliation and conflict 

resolution, refugee resettlement, and voter education in East Timor. This 

legislation also responds to calls by the East Timor leadership to enhance 

our bilateral trade and investment relationship by mandating a series of 

steps to increase the involvement of U.S. trade and exports agencies in 

East Timor. It would also establish a Peace Corps program, launch a million 

dollar scholarship program, and urge the United Nations to apply for GSP 

(Generalized System of Preferences) status for East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Patrick Kennedy, a leading co-sponsor of the bill, echoed 

Congressman Lantos' sentiments. &quot;East Timor has made excellent strides over 

the past year with the start of their fledgling democracy. This legislation 

will clarify our role and assistance to them through a meaningful and 

specific trade, aid and security agenda with East Timor,&quot; he said.
