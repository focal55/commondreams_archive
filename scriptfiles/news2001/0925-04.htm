- September 25 - Greenpeace has warned that global security is being increasingly eroded by the signals being given by the US on the issue of nuclear testing and development programs. In an effort to secure cooperation with Pakistan, the US has agreed to remove economic sanctions against India and Pakistan imposed for their development and testing of nuclear weapons. The deal could lead to the funding of a renewed nuclear weapons program.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international environmental organization has also called on both India and Pakistan to give assurances that they will not use the aid for any nuclear development or programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What kind of signal is George Bush sending to the world about his vision of global security with this deal? The prize of a temporary alliance can not be at the cost of further nuclear proliferation in an already volatile region,&quot; warned Gerd Leipold , executive director of Greenpeace International. &quot;The US has the opportunity to reverse its current isolationist policies, not just on nuclear issues, and develop a truly global coalition, which could be an international force for wide-ranging political and humanitarian change, but instead the alliance is becoming a marketplace for bargaining over weapons of mass destruction.&quot; At a time of global insecurity the issue of nuclear weapons development and proliferation is becoming ever more urgent. &middot; The US has already outlined plans to upgrade its own nuclear weapons arsenal, cutting old stocks in favor of fewer, but more powerful weapons. &middot; The Administration has committed billions of dollars to the US Star Wars missile program., which will ignite a new nuclear arms race. &middot; The US has also signaled it will turn a blind eye to China's plans for nuclear testing and development in exchange for silence on the issue of Star Wars. &middot; India and Pakistan had sanctions imposed three years ago following tit-for-tat weapons testing programs., now those sanctions could be lifted. &middot; Israel, in common with the US, China, India and Pakistan, is a nuclear state that has so far failed to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on nuclear weapons. &middot; Although the UK, France and Russia have ratified the CTBT, they still hold a significant nuclear arsenal. Long-term security can never be assured while weapons of mass destruction are held and could be used by so many states. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace believes true global security is not only about military issues and is urging all nations to develop an international coalition based on resolving the root cause of conflict and instability. Global security is not won through weapons based alliances. It is won by securing and sustaining communities and environment, food supply and production. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only world-wide cooperation can address these fundamental issues. This coalition must use this opportunity to address what really brings instability and insecurity to the world. The development of weapons of mass destruction, the threat of chemical and biological warfare, combined with a blatant disregard in many countries for the need to take immediate action to halt the devastating effects of climate change and ancient forest destruction form the basis of conflict,&quot; said Leipold. &quot;By solving these fundamental issues through negotiation and cooperation true global security can be achieved. That should be the goal of this international alliance.&quot; </font></p>
