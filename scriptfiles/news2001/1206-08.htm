- December 6 - The National Abortion 

Federation (NAF) today commended Representative Louise Slaughter 

(D-NY), Co-Chair of the bipartisan Pro-Choice Caucus, for 

introducing in the House of Representatives a Resolution that 

condemns over 550 anthrax threat letters sent to women's 

reproductive health clinics in Oct. and Nov. The letters were 

signed by the Army of God, a domestic terrorist organization. &quot;We 

are delighted that Representative Slaughter has introduced this 

resolution condemning domestic terrorism directed at women's 

reproductive health clinics,&quot; said Vicki Saporta, Executive 

Director of NAF. &quot;We applaud her efforts to urge the 

administration, law enforcement and related government agencies to 

bring all those who commit acts of terrorism to justice.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Abortion Federation has been collecting statistics 

on violence and disruption against abortion providers for over 

twenty years. Since 1977 there have been 7 murders, 17 attempted 

murders, 41 bombings, 165 arsons, 82 attempted arsons and bombings, 

122 assaults, 343 death threats, 3 kidnappings, 315 trespasses, 438 

stalkings, 68 burglaries, 950 acts of vandalism, 100 butyric acid 

attacks and over 630 anthrax threats. &quot;Abortion providers have 

been the targets of anti-choice terrorism for over twenty-five 

years, but they refuse to be deterred from providing safe and legal 

reproductive health care services to women,&quot; said Saporta. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saporta extended her thanks to Representative Slaughter for 

introducing this important Resolution against domestic terrorism 

and in support of women's reproductive health care providers. She 

stated, &quot;We encourage other members of Congress to support ending 

domestic terrorism against women's reproductive health care 

providers by signing on to Representative Slaughter's Resolution.&quot; </font></p>
