<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SACRAMENTO, CA- July 17 - The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) 2001 National Petroleum Forum (Forum) united ranchers and environmentalists in their condemnation of the BLM's grievous miscarriage of the public trust. Excluding environmentalists, ranchers, and even BLM wildlife biologists, soil chemists or any non-oil representative, a panel of petroleum industry and BLM oil advocates outlined initiatives to speed drill permitting processes and to allow new drilling absent the completion of environmental analyses. Moreover, while BLM readily acknowledged that Resource Management Plans (RMP) were out of date and not in compliance with federal law, they asked industry what incentives BLM could provide to open more public lands to drilling. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It was unbelievable to hear BLM literally &quot;sell-out&quot; the American public to the highest bidder - the petroleum industry. What's scary is that the federal agency charged with impartial stewardship of America's public lands values public health, safety, ranchers' livelihoods, wildlife, and public opinion so little that those concerns were not even given a voice in the debate,&quot; said Katy Rexford of Bluewater Network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 100% of the issues panel and 97% of participants representing the interests of the petroleum industry, no meaningful inclusion of non-oil interests were reflected in the advisory notes to be submitted to BLM. Forum working groups devised oil industry wish lists masked as multi-stakeholder recommendations to accelerate drilling and pare down environmental protections on public lands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This meeting seemed like an extension of the industry-biased Cheney Energy Team,&quot; said Travis Stills of the Oil and Gas Accountability Project. BLM employees itemized a 17-point plan for implementing the Bush/Cheney Energy Policy that was released in May. Then, BLM openly solicited the oil and gas industry's further input before the 17-point plan is fully adopted by Secretary Norton. Stills continued, &quot;I am amazed to see that the administration intends to implement the energy policy without a series of public hearings. The BLM and Department of Energy's handling of this meeting is perhaps the most open and flagrant disregard of the public trust and the law that I have ever witnessed in government.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BLM's exclusive relationship with the petroleum industry is not only unfair to the American public, it may be illegal. Federal statutes prohibit unbalanced advisory groups to federal agencies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The petroleum interests repeatedly stated that they wanted the BLM to treat them as good customers. However, both the industry and the BLM forgot that the American people are the 'owners' of the public lands, and those owners were not consulted in this Forum,&quot; said Michael Painter of Californians for Western Wilderness. </font></p>
