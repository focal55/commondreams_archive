- August 23 - &quot;Millions of women will breathe a sigh of relief when Jesse Helms leaves the U.S. Senate,&quot; said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Kim Gandy. &quot;His rants against women's rights, his ignorant statements about lesbians and gays, and his opposition to civil rights and reproductive freedom have made him a darling of the radical right and a danger to women everywhere.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Until the Senate changed hands this year, Helms had blocked ratification of an important U.N. treaty, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW),&quot; Gandy said. &quot;He effectively prevented the Senate from even considering this treaty.&quot; More than 165 nations have ratified CEDAW -- the U.S. is one of the few nations that has yet to do so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Helms even went so far as to bully his colleagues who support the treaty,&quot; Gandy continued. &quot;In 1999, Helms ordered security to forcibly remove ten female members of the House of Representatives after they attempted to present him with a letter of support for CEDAW. Adding injury to insult, before ejecting the women he said, 'Please be a lady'. His lack of respect for women is just as deplorable as his opposition to women's rights.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW activists in North Carolina and around the country are gearing up to elect women's rights supporters to all levels of government in 2002,&quot; Gandy said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With support from our grassroots network, we will soon send our Senate allies reinforcements like North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall, who is expected to run for Helms' seat.&quot;</font></p>
