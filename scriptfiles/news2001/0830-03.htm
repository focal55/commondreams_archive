- August 30 - Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair of the 

Congressional Black Caucus, traveled to Durban, South Africa as part of the 

official U.S. delegation participating in the U.N. World Conference Against 

Racism, Xenophobia, and Related Forms of Intolerance (WCAR).



<p>"I would like to commend the U.N. for its efforts to eradicate the scourge of 

racial discrimination worldwide by holding this conference in Durban, South 

Africa," said Congresswoman Johnson.  "This conference presents a wonderful 

opportunity for the leaders of the world to come together all on

one accord to acknowledge the perils of racism and to plan its abolishment."



<p>After much deliberation, President Bush's administration decided to send a State 

Department delegation, which in addition to Congresswoman Johnson, includes 

Congressman Tom Lantos (D-CA) and is headed by Michael Southwick, a 

deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of International Organizations.



<p>"The United States role in the international community is that of leadership and 

we impart tremendous influence on a variety of issues," said Congresswoman 

Johnson.  "It is incumbent on the United States to use its power and resources 

to ensure that this World Conference and any forum that seeks to address the 

issue of racism achieves its objectives to end this egregious violation here and 

abroad."



<p>Congresswoman Johnson will join several of her Congressional Black Caucus 

colleagues who have also traveled to Durban to participate in WCAR.



<p>"Since its inception, the Congressional Black Caucus has championed equality 

for all through historic struggles for civil rights," said Congresswoman Johnson. 

 "And, in keeping with that tradition, we will remain steadfast in our charge to 

fearlessly step out and provide leadership in the fight to encourage racial 

understanding both in America and abroad."



<p>The conference will begin Friday, August 31, 2001 and will end Friday, 

September 7.  Other Congressional Black Caucus Members attending the 

conference include Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), 

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-CA), Rep.

Donna Christen-Christensen (D-VI), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) and Rep. 

DianeWatson (D-CA).
