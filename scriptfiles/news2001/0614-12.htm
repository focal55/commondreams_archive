- June 15 - In light of a landmark decision Tuesday, NOW is challenging President Bush to reinstate the contraception coverage requirement for federal employees and their families in his budget. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Lasnik ruled that employers unlawfully discriminate against women when they offer health coverage that pays for a full range of drugs for men but not birth control for women. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Other employers cannot discriminate against women in their prescription drug plans, and neither should our government,&quot; said NOW President Patricia Ireland.  &quot;If Bush still insists on cutting contraceptive coverage in complete disregard of the federal court ruling and the similar position of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that would make him a pretty lousy boss.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Bush's budget he proposes dropping the requirement that health programs insuring millions of  federal workers and their families cover multiple forms of birth control.  This despite the fact that a large majority of people in the U.S. support contraception coverage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision comes in the same week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released data showing that the U.S. teen pregnancy rate has been steadily declining, reaching a 20-year low.  The abortion rate among teens is down by an even greater degree. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we've seen in the CDC report, increased access and more effective birth control use is helping lower teen pregnancies and abortions,&quot; said Ireland.  &quot;Why does President Bush want to make it harder for women to get birth control?  Does he really want to take a step backward that could result in more unplanned pregnancies?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are counting on Congress to reverse Bush's decision and make our federal government a model employer,&quot; said Ireland. </font></p>
