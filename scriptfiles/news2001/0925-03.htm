- September 25 - Today the Supreme Court 

added several cases to its docket for the term that begins on 

Oct. 1. Many of the cases now before the Court involve fundamental 

constitutional principles and will significantly affect public 

policy on a range of issues, including affirmative action, free 

speech on the Internet, and publicly funded vouchers for religious 

schools. Several of the most important cases to be decided by the 

Court are in areas like affirmative action and church-state 

separation, where the justices are closely divided. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Constitutional liberties are coming up for some close votes,&quot; 

said People For the American Way Foundation (PFAWF) President Ralph 

G. Neas. &quot;These cases should remind Americans of the importance of 

the Supreme Court and of the powerful impact that will be made by 

future appointments.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will play a pivotal 

role, potentially determining not just the outcome of specific 

cases, such as school vouchers and affirmative action, but also in 

the interpretation of key constitutional principles and the 

legality of many other present and proposed government programs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Publicly Funded Vouchers for Religious Schools </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Simmons-Harris vs. Zelman, the Court will review a decision 

by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that the Cleveland school 

voucher program is unconstitutional because it violates 

church-state separation. The decision in this case could affect 

not only school vouchers, but also other efforts to funnel 

government dollars to pervasively religious institutions, such as 

the administration's faith-based initiative. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PFAWF, which is serving as co-counsel for the Ohio citizens who 

have challenged the voucher program, has just released a background 

report, &quot;Five Years and Counting: A Closer Look at the Cleveland 

Voucher Program.&quot; A copy of the report can be found at: 

<a href="http://www.pfaw.org/issues/education/cleveland-9-21.pdf%20" target="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/issues/education/cleveland-9-21.pdf </a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Religious school vouchers have been repeatedly rejected by 

voters, by Congress, and by federal courts,&quot; Neas said, &quot;and now 

the Supreme Court will decide their constitutionality.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that in 1973, the Supreme Court struck down a similar 

New York private school tuition reimbursement program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Affirmative Action </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Adarand Constructors, Inc. vs. Mineta, the Court will review 

a decision by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals that the 

Department of Transportation's affirmative action program for 

disadvantaged business enterprises is constitutional. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Court could well decide whether any form of affirmative 

action is constitutional,&quot; said Neas. PFAWF has filed an amicus 

curiae brief in support of the lower court's decision upholding the 

program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an earlier decision in the Adarand case, the Court directed 

that the program be reviewed under strict constitutional scrutiny 

to determine whether it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 

Fourteenth Amendment by improperly favoring minorities. Pursuant to 

the Clinton administration's &quot;mend it don't end it&quot; approach to 

affirmative action, the department revised the program, and the 

appeals court found that it was narrowly tailored to promote a 

compelling government interest in remedying and preventing 

discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other Issues </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the Court will decide at least a dozen other 

non-criminal cases with far-reaching impact on civil rights, free 

expression and other individual rights. These cases are briefly 

discussed in PFAWF's new Summary of Key Individual Rights Cases in 

the Supreme Court in 2001-02. A copy of this document can be found 

at:

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Examples of the cases discussed include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Ashcroft vs. ACLU, which concerns the constitutionality of a 

1998 federal law seeking to severely limit Internet communications 

by prohibiting posting of &quot;harmful to minors&quot; materials. PFAWF has 

filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the appellate court 

decision striking down the statute. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Correctional Services vs. Malesko, which concerns whether an 

individual can bring a federal constitutional claim against a 

private corporation performing a federal governmental function 

under color of federal law, such as private prison contractors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Prudential HMO vs. Moran, which concerns whether patients can 

sue HMOs under state law for refusing to consent to necessary 

medical treatment, or whether such claims are pre-empted by federal 

law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this year, People For the American Way Foundation 

released an update to last year's &quot;Courting Disaster&quot; report, which 

analyzed the consequences of a further rightward shift on the 

Supreme Court. The original report and the 2001 update can be
