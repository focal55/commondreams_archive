- January 5 - The final decision on the plan to 

            protect roadless areas in national forests that the Clinton Administration 

            will announce Friday afternoon is a conservation victory as grand 

            as the trees it will protect, according to Tiernan Sittenfeld, U.S. 

            PIRG Conservation Advocate.

<p align="left"> "We are pleased that President Clinton and the Forest 

            Service have listened to the American public and responded to the 

            overwhelming public mandate to protect our last pristine wild forests," 

            said Sittenfeld. "Our grandchildren will praise President Clinton 

            for protecting our wild heritage for future generations." </p>

          <p align="left">The new Roadless Area Conservation Rule will protect 

            58.5 million acres of America's last wild places from destructive 

            activities like road building and most commercial logging. "This conservation 

            plan is one of the most sweeping environmental initiatives in decades 

            and will ensure that our national forests continue to provide clean 

            water for communities across the country, recreational opportunities 

            for millions of people, and critical habitat for rare and endangered 

            species," said Sittenfeld.</p>

          <p align="left">Sittenfeld warned that special interests and their allies 

            in Congress have already threatened to roll back the new wild forest 

            protection plan in spite of the two million Americans who commented 

            in support of the policy. Sittenfeld cited recent statements by Shawn 

            Keough, executive director of Associated Logging Contractors, "To 

            allow a policy like this to go unchallenged would be a travesty". 

            In addition, Rep. John E. Peterson (R-PA) has stated, "When the roadless 

            policy comes before Congress for consideration, as is expected early 

            next year, I will do everything in my power to stop it".</p>

          <p align="left">"Given the overwhelming public support for protecting 

            our last wild places, it would be wrong for some members of Congress 

            to side with the special interests instead of their constituents. 

            We urge members of Congress to defend this new rule in order to save 

            our natural heritage for future generations," concluded Sittenfeld.
