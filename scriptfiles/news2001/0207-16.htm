- February 7 - Mexico&#146;s truck inspection system, instituted in response

to the United States&#146; concerns about dangerous rigs, is riddled with holes that allow

vehicles with major safety defects to stay on the road, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Press/truckregs.htm">a Public Citizen analysis</a> has found.

<p>Mexico&#146;s program is particularly critical in light of a ruling issued Tuesday

ordering the U.S. to permit Mexican trucks to have access to all U.S. roads. If the Bush

administration as expected complies with the panel&#146;s order &#151; rather than pay

trade sanctions &#151; U.S. highways may soon be flooded with trucks from Mexico.</p>



<p>Under Mexico&#146;s new program, which is voluntary for the first year, safety defects

that merely incur a fine and a request that the problem be fixed within 20 days would

cause a truck in the U.S. to be removed from the road. These defects include improperly

stored hazardous materials, missing fuses, worn or exposed wires, a lack of windshield

wipers, a shattered windshield, damaged tires, broken wheel rims, leaky fuel lines, worn

or cracked load securement chains, loose steering wheels, cracked brake drums and

inoperative brake linings. </p>



<p>&quot;We can&#146;t afford to invite trucks with balding tires, slipshod brakes, leaky

exhaust systems, and bad steering wheels to roam freely on our roads,&quot; said Joan

Claybrook, Public Citizen president and former administrator of the National Highway

Traffic Safety Administration. &quot;Mexico has made an effort to begin addressing these

issues, but it falls way short of the mark. Until the country has a stringent set of

standards that are enforced, we shouldn&#146;t allow these trucks to have unlimited access

to our highways.&quot;</p>



<p>On Tuesday, a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) tribunal found the U.S. has

been violating NAFTA because it has limited access of Mexican trucks to a narrow 20-mile

commercial zone along the border. NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, required the U.S. to

allow Mexican trucks access to all border-state roads starting in 1995, and to drive

anywhere in the country by January 2000. The Clinton administration recognized the danger

the trucks posed and for seven years refused to expand their access beyond a 20-mile

radius from the border.</p>



<p>According to the panel, the U.S. may enforce its own standards on any trucks traveling

in the U.S. But doing so effectively would require a legion of federal and state

inspectors, and the U.S. lacks personnel and facilities to check most Mexican trucks. In

fact, data show fewer than 1 percent of the four million Mexican trucks entering the U.S.

now are inspected (and 35 percent of those are taken out of service for safety failures).</p>



<p>In July, Mexico established a set of fledgling standards for commercial trucks, but

they are greatly lacking, Public Citizen has found. The rules provide for roadside

inspections only on Mexico&#146;s federal highways, which constitute only 10 percent of

Mexico&#146;s roads. Most rules for critical items such as tires, headlights and hazardous

materials are voluntary for the first year. Even once they become mandatory, the rules are

far from comprehensive. Public Citizen also found that:</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>Industries that will profit from the lack of adequate safety rules for trucks crossing

    the border had a heavy hand in crafting Mexico&#146;s safety regulations;</p>

  </blockquote>

<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    <p>Mexico&#146;s inspection rules set a maximum time limit of 30 minutes for an inspection

    of a general cargo carrier and limits inspection of a hazardous materials carrier to 20

    minutes &#151; not nearly enough time for a thorough inspection. In contrast, the U.S.

    sets no time limit for inspections; and,</p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>



<blockquote>

  <blockquote>

    <p>Mexico sets no limit on the hours a commercial driver may drive. Rather, the company

    sets the limit. The U.S., in contrast, has hours-of-service rules that play a critical

    role in reducing crashes caused by drowsy drivers (even though they should be shorter).</p>
