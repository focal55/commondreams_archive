- February 8 - As early as late February, Senator Frank Murkowski 

                      (R-AK) is expected to introduce an energy bill that will 

                      direct billions of dollars in subsidies to some of the most 

                      profitable companies in the nation, according to Taxpayers 

                      for Common Sense, a leading opponent of corporate welfare.</font>      

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This 

                      bill is 21st Century trickle-down economics - it gives billions 

                      of dollars to energy corporations, while taxpayers don't 

                      get anything,&quot; said Cena Swisher, Program Director 

                      at Taxpayers for Common Sense. &quot;It looks like the political 

                      contributions of these companies have greased the wheels 

                      of the corporate welfare machine.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 

                      example, in the last election cycle, the oil and gas industry 

                      gave more than $29 million In campaign contributions and 

                      is awarded generous tax breaks and subsidies in Murkowski's 

                      legislation, says the group.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

                      bill will focus on subsidies for oil, gas, coal and nuclear 

                      power industries. Some estimates put the total price tag 

                      at least $20 billion over the next 10 years. It also includes 

                      a provision for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 

                      Refuge (ANWR).</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While 

                      ANWR may be the big dog in this fight, collectively these 

                      subsidies and tax breaks will take a bigger bite out of 

                      taxpayers,&quot; continued Swisher.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

                      effectiveness of subsidies contained within the bill is 

                      questionable, according to TCS.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This 

                      bill simply will not reverse our current energy crisis,&quot; 

                      stated Swisher, &quot;These subsidies have proven to be 

                      expensive anachronisms, yet we continue to throw billions 

                      of dollars at them.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 

                      bill is being proposed at a time when the oil industry is 

                      seeing record profits. Last year, Exxon-Mobil reported profits 

                      of $17 billion - the most ever earned by the company. Chevron 

                      and Texaco have also reported sharp profit increases. </font></p>

<p align="left">

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Swisher 

                      concluded, &quot;Why allow these companies to take billions 

                      from the taxpayer pump, when they are seeing record profits?&quot;
