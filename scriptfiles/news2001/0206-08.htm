- February 6 - Noted human rights advocate Ethel Kennedy today

presented the Sierra Club's "Chico Mendes" award to imprisoned

environmentalist Rodolfo Montiel for his outstanding environmental heroism.

Montiel was recognized  for "extraordinary courage and leadership in

defending the old-growth forests of Mexico's Sierra de Petatlán at the cost

of personal freedom."

<p>

"I'm delighted to join the Sierra Club in honoring Rodolfo Montiel Flores

with the Chico Mendes Award, named for another hero who sacrificed his life

in his struggle to defend human rights and safeguard the environment," said

Ethel Kennedy.  "Rodolfo's quest to protect the forests of Guerrero

exemplifies Robert Kennedy's belief that 'those with the courage to enter

the moral conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of

the world.'"

<p>

"Rodolfo Montiel's bravery and dedication represent the highest qualities

in environmental protection," said Alejandro Queral, Sierra Club's Human

Rights and the Environment Program director. "The arrest, torture and

imprisonment of Montiel and Cabrera represent the worst actions of those in

power against people and the environment."

<p>

Montiel and his colleague, Teodoro Cabrera, are currently in prison for their efforts to halt the rampant logging in their farming community.

Montiel, one of the founding members of the Organización de Campesinos

Ecologistas de la Sierra de Petatlan y Coyuca de Catalan, A.C.

(Organization of Campesino Environmentalists of the Sierra de Petatlan and

Coyuca de Catalan), organized farmers to oppose the rampant, and possibly

illegal, logging in these mountains in Guerrero, Mexico.

<p>

"It is an honor for the Sierra Club to bestow this award to Rodolfo

Montiel. We are hopeful that soon the government of President Fox will put

an end to this sad event in the history of the environment in Mexico and

secure the freedom of these environmental activists," continued Queral. "We

hope that Presidents Bush and Fox discuss the human rights violations

against these environmentalists when they meet on February 16. Just as

environmental and human rights groups in both countries are working more

closely together, we hope our public officials will also each out to each

other to address these issues."

<p>

On May 2, 1999, Montiel and Cabrera were arrested by members of the 40th

Infantry Battalion of the Mexican Army, who beat them, threatened them at

gunpoint and allegedly tortured the two men, forcing them to confess to trumped-up charges of drug trafficking and illegal possession of weapons.

The Sierra Club and Amnesty International believe that these charges were

created to imprison Montiel and Cabrera for their environmental activism.

Last year, Amnesty International declared Montiel and Cabrera Prisoners of

Conscience.

<p>

In mid-July, the Mexico Commission on Human Rights released the findings of

their investigation in the case.  The Commission declared that Montiel and

Cabrera had, in fact, been tortured, that they have been improperly

detained and that they were not in possession of firearms when arrested, as

the Military had claimed.

<p>

The Sierra Club established the Chico Mendes Award 1989 to recognize

individuals or non-governmental organizations, outside the United States

who have exhibited extraordinary courage and leadership, at the grassroots

level, in the universal struggle to protect the environment.  Previous

recipients include the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People

(Nigeria), and Aleksandr Nikitin (Russia).

<p>

The Chico Mendes Award is named for the Brazilian rubber-tapper who was killed after speaking out for responsible logging practices in the

rainforest.

<p>

Edgar Cortez Moralez of the PRODH stated that PRODH (the human rights group

representing Montiel and Cabrera in court) will file an amparo (an appeal

filed when an individual's constitutional rights have been violated) tochallenge the court's decision to uphold the conviction.  Cortez stated that once the amparo is filed, "The Mexican government will have yet

another opportunity to recognize the human rights violations against the

environmentalists and see that justice is done in this case."



<p>

The award to Montiel reads:

<p>

For extraordinary courage and leadership in defending the old-growth

forests of Mexico's Sierra de Petatlán at the cost of personal freedom, and

for inspiring individuals and communities to unite in their opposition of

the destruction of the natural world.

<p>

Por su extraordinaria valentía y liderazgo demostrados al defender los

bosques de la Sierra de Petatlán, México, aún cuando el costo ha sido

perder la libertad; y por inspirar a individuos y comunidades para unirse

en su oposición a la destrucción de la naturaleza.
