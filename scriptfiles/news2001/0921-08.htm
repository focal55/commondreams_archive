Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and co-editor of &quot;Beyond the 

Storm: A Gulf Crisis Reader,&quot; Bennis said today: &quot;In Bush's speech we got 

no doctrine, no strategy, no evidence. What we did get was a lot of Wild 

West rhetoric -- dead or alive material. In Afghanistan, 25 percent of the 

people were already dependent solely on foreign-aid food, and all 

international workers have left because of the U.S. threats. Today, the 

process of starvation begins. Bush said he would use everything at the 

U.S.'s disposal, but apparently that doesn't include Washington's 

formidable arsenal of diplomacy -- instead he outright rejected 

negotiations or discussions. While condemning 'self-appointed rulers,' Bush 

rallied to the defense of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt -- all examples of 

absolute monarchies or self-perpetuating regimes.&quot;<br>

A Jesuit priest with the West Side Jesuit Community in New York City, Harak 

said today: &quot;If we in our turn plan on militarism, vengeance, and 

retaliation, if we steel our spirits against the suffering which such 

pursuits always cause to the innocent, in short, if we turn to the tools of 

death, then whatever hollow triumph we may trumpet, it will have been Death 

alone which has won.&quot; Harak has visited the Mideast many times, he added: &quot;When I've spoken to families in Iraq who have suffered from the economic 

sanctions and bombings; or with Palestinian fathers and sons tortured by an 

Israeli government which we back -- they asked me the same question people 

have been asking: 'Why does America hate us?'&quot;<br>

A junior at George Washington University, Braun said today: &quot;Thousands of 

students across the U.S. held vigils, teach-ins and rallies on Thursday as 

part of a national day of peace and solidarity. We are shocked and saddened 

by the events of last week -- and are dedicated to working towards policies 

that do not visit such tragedy upon others throughout the world via 

military action.&quot;<br>

Vice president of the Center for Constitutional Rights and an expert on war 

powers, Ratner said today: &quot;The United States should deal with the events 

of September 11 as criminal acts, investigate and prosecute those guilty 

and do so with the backing of the United Nations Security Council.&quot;<br>

Professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of 

Law, Boyle said today: &quot;The United States is under an absolute obligation 

to resolve this dispute with Afghanistan in a peaceful manner as required 

by UN Charter Article 2(3) and Article 33.... Accordingly, this dispute 

must be resolved by invoking the 1971 Montreal Sabotage Convention and the 

1997 UN International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. 

Furthermore, the United States should offer to submit this entire dispute 

with Afghanistan to the International Court of Justice in The Hague (the 

so-called World Court).&quot;<br>

Author of &quot;The Newest Explosions of Terrorism&quot; and professor of 

international relations at California State University in Chico, Grosscup 

said today: &quot;The Israeli model is not only ineffective in dealing with 

terrorism, as the track record of anti-Israeli violence shows, but is also 

bankrupt both politically and morally...&quot;
