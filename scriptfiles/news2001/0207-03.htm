- February 7 - Thousands of recent

corporate and manufacturing layoffs will likely increase the rolls

of Americans without health insurance, according to the American

Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's largest,

independent medical student organization.

<p>"It is unconscionable that there are more than 42 million

Americans without health insurance and those ranks will only

continue to swell until we take the bold, necessary step of

ensuring quality health care for all," said Sindhu Srinivas, MD,

AMSA (<a href="http://www.amsa.org">http://www.amsa.org</a>) national

president. "We continue to put

forward small piecemeal proposals for segments of our population

but no one deserves to be left out. It is time for true reform."

<p>This crisis could be tackled with a national movement to create

a single-payer health-care system where each and every American,

regardless of employment status, would have access to

comprehensive, quality health-care services.

<p>In this type of system, patient, physician and government

representatives determine the scope of coverage, under public

scrutiny, rather than behind the closed doors of a corporate

boardroom. This simplified model of health-care delivery

significantly reduces administrative waste and allows health-care

dollars to be spent on clinical services rather than profit and

excess administration. Medicare has proven this by spending less

than 3 percent on overhead while the private sector spends an

average of 12 percent-14 percent. Sen. Paul Wellstone's (D-MN)

Health Security for All Act and Rep. McDermott (D-WA) &amp; Conyer's

(D-MI) American Health Security Act are two legislative options

which deserve serious consideration, and either would be more

successful at true reform than distractions such as a 'patients

bill of rights.'

<p>A study conducted by The Lewin Group found the state of Maryland

could save over $300 million dollars a year under a single-payer

system, while covering every resident including the presently

uninsured. A similar study conducted by the Massachusetts Medical

Society found that state could save upwards of $1 billion dollars

if it enacted a single-payer system, again, while covering everyone

including the uninsured. The average American would likely see

lower out-of-pocket costs for services and employers would be able

to reduce health expenditures. These monetary savings could then

be used to improve the health-care infrastructure.

<p>As part of its ongoing public education campaign on this issue,

AMSA recently compiled a chart comparing congressional and interest

group proposals for addressing health reform, and that chart can be

found online at <a href="http://www.amsa.org/lad/uhcinitiative.html">http://www.amsa.org/lad/uhcinitiative.html</a>.
