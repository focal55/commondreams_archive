- February 14 - Following is a statement by

Gloria Feldt, president, Planned Parenthood Federation of America:

<p>More than a million-and-a-half unintended pregnancies a year could

be prevented, and the number of abortions in this country could be

reduced by about 800,000, if emergency contraception (EC) were used

widely. But the only way EC is likely to be used widely is if it is

made readily available. Women can't use EC if they can't get it

easily and conveniently, when and where they need it.

<p>EC has been used safely for 30 years. Making EC available over the

counter will further empower women in this country to be able to make

their own responsible choices about whether and when to have

children. This is a clear opportunity to use scientific knowledge in

our possession to better the health and lives of Americans. We

strongly urge the Food and Drug Administration to approve emergency

contraceptive pills for over-the-counter sales without a

prescription. We look forward to the day in the very near future

that we will celebrate this next milestone for women's health.

<p><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the world's largest

and most trusted voluntary family planning organization. It comprises

127 affiliates that operate 875 health centers nationwide, which

serve nearly five million Americans annually. For more information
