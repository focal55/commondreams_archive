<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NORFALK, VA - August 28  - In a closely watched case believed to be the longest running cyber-squabble in Internet history, a Federal Appeals Court has upheld an order by U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton that a hijacked Web address (<A HREF="http://www.peta.org" target="_new"><U>http://www.peta.org</U></A>) be turned over to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). PETA is celebrating by relaunching the site and adding lots of spice. (The hijacker had claimed that his use of the address for a site called &quot;People Eating Tasty Animals" was a parody, but the appeals court agreed with Hilton's ruling, noting "there is no suggestion of [such] a parody.")

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the controversy bringing hundreds of thousands of visitors to its home page, PETA has laced it with new, fun interactive features, including the "Throw Me at a Fur Wearer" game featuring Joan Rivers and other fur-wearing celebs. The site was nominated for a Webby award this year.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other favorite visitor stops on the site include the PETA Mall, where you can buy veggie caviar (yes, no fish eggs) and toys for dogs and cats; the campaigns section, where you can watch James Cromwell's arrest footage or listen to Charlize Theron talk about where pet shop puppies come from; and GoVeg.com, where you can download animal-friendly recipes . Brand new to PETA.org this week: </font></P>

"From who to write to get traveling polar bears out of a Puerto Rican circus to tips on traveling with a cat, from the dirty lowdown on health charities that still fund animal experiments to signing up for a Veggie Starter Kit, PETA.org offers facts<U><B> </B>and</U> fun." </font></P>
