- February 6 - The current clashes

between Israelis and Palestinians have refocused world attention

on a conflict many had hoped was nearing resolution. However,

most news reports of pitched battles and political proclamations

rarely address crucial points of international law. To understand

exactly which violations of international humanitarian law are

being committed in the region, the Crimes of War Project assigned

a former Newsweek correspondent in the Middle East to interview

legal experts from Israel, Palestine and the United States.

<p>Among the questions addressed are: Do the current clashes amount

to war? Is the Israeli military response justified in the face of

Palestinian actions? Are Israel's blockades of Palestinian areas a

form of collective punishment? Are armed Israeli settlers legal

combatants? Is the intermingling of Palestinian gunmen in amongst

stone-throwing youths tantamount to using human shields? The

answers to such questions can, we believe, help separate rhetoric

from fact by putting the behavior of the parties into the framework

of long-established, if often ignored, international legal

standards.

<p>Those consulted to help explain the relevance of these important

but often confusing laws include:

<p>-- Steven Ratner, University of Texas School of Law and author of

"Accountability for Human Rights Atrocities in International Law:

Beyond the Nuremberg Legacy" (Oxford U. Press, 1997).

<p>-- Charles Shamas, Palestinian lawyer and Senior Partner,

MATTIN Group

<p>-- Eyal Benvenisti, Israeli legal scholar and author of "The

International Law of Occupation" (Princeton University Press, 1993).

<p>-- Yaron Ezrahi, political science professor at Hebrew University

in Jerusalem and author of "Rubber Bullets: Power and Conscience

in Modern Israel" (Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux, 1997).

<p>-- Mustafa Barghouthi, physician and president of the Union of

Palestinian Medical Relief Committees.

<p>The interviews can be read on

<p>The views presented are those of the individuals and not those

of any institution or the Crimes of War Project.

<p><i>The <a href="http://www.crimesofwar.org/">Crimes of War Project</a> is an independent, non-profit

organization solely dedicated to raising awareness of international

humanitarian law among the media, policy makers, diplomats, the

human rights and humanitarian aid communities, and the general

public.</i>
