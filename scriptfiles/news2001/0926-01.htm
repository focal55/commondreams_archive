<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BRASILIA, Brazil - September 26 - New evidence of large-scale illegal mahogany logging deep in the Amazon rainforest was released by Greenpeace today. Images obtained through recent aerial reconnaissance by the international environmental organization expose logging operations in lands belonging to the Kayap&oacute; Indians, which is strictly prohibited by Brazilian law. The U.S. is the world's largest importer of Brazilian mahogany.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. market is fueling the illegal destruction of the Amazon,&quot; said Scott Paul, Greenpeace Forest Campaigner. &quot;These companies have been breaking Brazilian laws for years. Now we have undeniable proof. The Brazilian Government has no choice but to follow up and the U.S. marketplace must wake up.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Brazilian government records 24,828 square yards of mahogany were exported from the Brazilian port of Belem to the U.S. market between February 2000 and February 2001. Products sold as mahogany on the U.S. market often come from pristine areas of the Amazon, in spite of a moratorium on new mahogany operations that has been in place since 1996. The Brazilian Government estimates that 80 percent of all logging in the Amazon is illegal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Satellite images obtained by Greenpeace reveal details of the logging operations. This information is being delivered today to the Federal Prosecutor in Brasilia, along with Greenpeace's call for a full investigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For public relations reasons, most retail furniture companies in the U.S. claim that their mahogany does not come from the Amazon,&quot; continued Paul. &quot;This is often not true. Virtually all U.S. furniture manufacturers buy on the spot market, meaning they buy what's cheap at the time. Furniture makers typically do not have exclusive contracts with particular suppliers in a particular region.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Middle Land, on the edge of the Kayap&oacute; territory, where Greenpeace documented the illegal logging operation, is comprised of over 20.5 million acres of pristine Amazonian rainforest and is about the size of Austria. It is on the northern edge of the &quot;Mahogany Belt&quot; - a stretch of rainforest along the south side of the Amazon River, which has been heavily depleted by years of predatory logging. The largest remaining concentration of commercial stocks of mahogany in Brazil is in the Middle Lands and the indigenous lands that surround it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite numerous promises from the world's governments to protect our ancient forests, illegal and destructive logging is still the common reality for the Brazilian Amazon,&quot; said Greenpeace Amazon Campaign Coordinator Paulo Adario. &quot;Greenpeace is calling for an immediate moratorium on all industrial logging, both legal and illegal, in the Middle Land region of Par&aacute; State until a full assessment of the ecological values of this area can be completed and a credible land use plan developed and implemented.&quot;</font></p>
