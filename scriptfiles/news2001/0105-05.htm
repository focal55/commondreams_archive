- January 5 - The following is a

statement by William Meadows, president, The Wilderness Society:

<p>From Florida to Alaska Americans can celebrate one of the

nation's greatest environmental achievements as President Clinton

and the Forest Service today protected nearly 60 million acres of

the nation's wild forests from logging and other development. This

sweeping new protection is as important as the Clean Water Act, the

Clean Air Act, and other environmental landmarks.

<p>The Clinton Administration and the Forest Service provided

exceptional leadership in bringing about this new policy. Reaching

out to the American people in an unprecedented way, the Forest

Service held 600 public hearings and received comments from 1.7

million Americans speaking out in strong support for protecting the

nation's last remaining wild forests. That support was as broad as

it was deep. Republicans and Democrats, Easterners and Westerners,

and people from throughout our nation's cities, suburbs, and rural

communities all strongly back these new safeguards.

<p>Although some might try, this legacy of protection for our wild

forests -- with its widespread support -- should never and can

never be rolled back. The American people won't stand for it.

Founded in 1935, The Wilderness Society works to preserve

America's wilderness and to develop a nationwide network of

wildlands through public education, scientific analysis, and



advocacy. Its goal is to ensure that future generations will enjoy

the clean air and water, wildlife, natural beauty, and

opportunities for recreation and spiritual renewal provided by

protected forests, rivers, deserts, and mountains. </i>
