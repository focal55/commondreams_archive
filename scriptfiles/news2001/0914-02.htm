<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All strength to you, to the United States, and to all

the Americans; the Federation of Green Parties of the

Americas feels devastated for this National and

International Tragedy. Today, we begin the day with

this news of high impact, with this criminal and

coward terrorist act, which we completely reject. We

would like to express our solidarity, and support to

the Country, its victims and their relatives.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We want to reiterate that violence has never been and

never will be a form of coexistence among men. These

acts of barbarism deserve the reject of the

international community, because all acts of terrorism

affect all the nations of the world. No cause

justifies these criminal acts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of the Green party of Ukraine and its

&lt;<a href="http://www.gruene.de" target="_new">http://www.gruene.de</a>&gt; and Bundestag Group<br>

&lt;<a href="http://www.gruene-fraktion.de" target="_new">http://www.gruene-fraktion.de</a>&gt; regarding this week's<br>

tragic events<br>

Special Party Council, Alliance 90/The Greens<br>

September 13, 2001, Berlin</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Resolution</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The terrible attacks that were perpetrated against

the United States of America on September 11, 2001

were a cynical strike against the values of an open

civil society for which we stand.  These attacks have

evoked paralyzing horror, sadness, rage and great

concern, but they have also given rise to a strong

solidarity with the victims, their relations and the

entire American people.  Alliance 90/The Greens share

in this solidarity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. We support the United Nations Security Council's

demand that those responsible for the mass murder, the

organizers as well as the sponsors, be found out and

brought to justice.  We support the Security Council's

declaration that terrorist acts must be combated as a

threat to international peace.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The government of the United States has let it be

known that they will respond harshly to terrorist

aggression.  They have, for example, spoken of &quot;wiping

terrorism off the map&quot;.  This has fueled the concerns

of a broad part of German as well as European society

that an insufficiently circumspect reaction on the

part of the USA could in the end be what the

terrorists are counting on to build on the escalation

of violence.  Against this background we would

emphasize the legitimate right of the USA to

self-defense on the basis of the United Nations

Charter.  A democracy based on the rule of law is only

credible if in the detection and punishment of

evildoers, it does not violate its own principles. 

International law does not provide cover for

vengeance; we reject an escalation strategy tainted by

it.  Every possible course of action must be

accompanied by a political concept that stands the

test of time and contains the proposition for

effective handling of conflicts that feed on violence.

 We are calling for a fundamentally new orientation in

security policy, one in which first and foremost new

global threats can be countered by crisis prevention,

by  civil conflict resolution, by the creation of

global justice and the fair resolution of regional

conflicts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. After the national tragedy, the USA turned to the

NATO Council with an application that a

joint-defense-situation be established in accordance

with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  On September

12, 2001, The NATO Council unanimously found that the

facts of the terrorist attacks, that they were

directed from outside the USA, established the

applicability of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty.  In so

doing, for the first time, NATO has acceded to

formally assisting a member-state against an armed

attack, including military assistance, if necessary. 

The German Federal Government has acceded to this as

well.  This was a very difficult decision.  In the

face of terrorist attacks against US citizens,

however, we cannot oppose the employment of the

joint-defense-situation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. The acceptance of the joint-defense-situation does

not yet mean a decision in favor of participation in

the USA's military planning or actions.  The

acceptance of the joint-defense-situation does not

revoke the responsibility on the part of Germany to

decide for itself, in keeping with Constitutional

rules and especial Parliamentary provisos, what type

of assistance with what means it considers necessary

to reestablish and maintain security. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. The worldwide dismay produced by the terrorist

violence has made graphically clear to what extent the

world in which we live has grown together.  We

strongly object to all attempts to capitalize on this

dismay in order to pursue authoritarian policies using

strategies of insularity, national narrow-mindedness

and xenophobia.  Civil and open societies tolerate no

struggle between cultures.  They are founded on a

diversity of cultures and religions.  Every failure in

the dialog between cultures, especially the Islamic

culture, every failure to improve living conditions in

those countries that are breeding grounds for

terrorism catches up with us.  Insularity is a

backwards-looking illusion.  We continue to stand by

our vision of an international community of

cosmopolitan democracies.  That includes not only the

readiness to stand against terrorism in the defense of

a cosmopolitan democracy.  It also includes depriving

terrorism of its political basis through the promotion

of human rights, democracy, tolerance and

international justice.  Alliance 90/The Greens

champions these principles.</font></p>
