possibly as many as thirty-five, Afghan civilians died when U.S. bombs 

and gunfire hit their village, Chowkar-Karez, on the night of October 

22, Human Rights Watch said today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">None of the witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch knew of Taliban 

or Al-Qaida positions in the area of the attack. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch reiterated its call to the U.S.-led alliance to 

ensure that it is taking adequate precautions to avoid civilian 

casualties, and called for an immediate investigation into the bombing 

raid that hit Chowkar-Karez, located some forty kilometers north of the 

Taliban stronghold of Kandahar. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If there were military targets in the area, we'd like to know what they 

were,&quot; said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;This is 

the second instance in less than a week in which we've documented 

substantial civilian casualties from U.S. bombing raids. The Pentagon 

has got to do more to avoid these deaths.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch researchers located six wounded survivors of the 

October 22 bombing raid that hit Chowkar-Karez. The six are currently 

recovering in Quetta hospitals. Human Rights Watch also interviewed 

several additional persons who witnessed the attack but were not hurt. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among those wounded by the bombing are forty-year-old Sardar Bibi, who 

lost her husband and six children in the attack; five-year-old Shabir 

Ahmed, who received severe shrapnel wounds to his head and remains 

unconscious; Shabir Ahmed's seven-year-old brother, who was also 

wounded; and three adult sisters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the highly consistent accounts of the survivors, the bombs 

came from several aircraft that flew over the village of Chowkar-Karez, 

which is located in the Buri-Kala area of Kandahar province, some forty 

kilometers north of the city of Kandahar. The attack began at about 11 

p.m. on the night of Monday, October 22, 2001. Many of the people in the 

village then ran out of their homes, afraid that the bombs would fall on 

the homes. All witnesses stated that aircraft then returned to the area 

and began firing from guns. Many of the civilians were killed from the 

firing. The bombing and firing lasted for about one hour. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One family interviewed by Human Rights Watch provided the names of 

eighteen relatives killed in the incident, and another unrelated woman 

told Human Rights Watch that her husband and six children were killed, 

and that she had been told that as many as thirty-five people died in 

the raid. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of the witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch were adamant that 

there were no Taliban or Al-Qaida positions in the area of the attack, 

which is in a remote rural area of Afghanistan. In almost all other 

cases of civilian casualties caused by the U.S.-led bombing campaign 

investigated by Human Rights Watch, survivors and witnesses have been 

forthcoming in identifying Taliban or Al-Qaida military positions 

located nearby which could have been the target of the attack. It is 

impossible for Human Rights Watch to verify independently whether 

Taliban or Al-Qaida military targets existed in the area of 

Chowkar-Karez village, but the consistent statements of all witnesses 

and survivors that there were none is notable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mushfeqa, aged twenty, was interviewed by Human Rights Watch in a Quetta 

hospital where she and two sisters were recovering from shrapnel wounds. 

She explained that she and her extended family had fled from the city of 

Kandahar to their rural homes in Chowkar-Karez when the U.S.-led bombing 

campaign began. Referring to October 22, she told Human Rights Watch, 

&quot;It was at about 11 p.m. First, one plane came and dropped a bomb. We 

ran out of the home, because we were afraid to die there. Then, some 

went back inside. I was at the door, and some of the small children were 

outside. Then the plane came and it was firing. I saw my mother and my 

brother shot. My uncle ran to his car to turn off the lights. Then a 

bomb hit the car and he died. ... When the next bomb came, I was inside 

the room. I was injured from the shrapnel.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Belqais, aged forty, a relative of Mushfeqa, confirmed to Human Rights 

Watch the deaths of her two brothers and many of their relatives. She 

named among the dead her eldest brother Noor Ahmed, aged fifty, his wife 

Masooma, aged thirty-five, and their four children, as well as her 

second brother, Saleh Ahmed, aged thirty-five, his wife Zarmina, and one 

of their sons. The two surviving sons of Saleh Ahmed, aged five and 

seven, are currently hospitalized in Quetta and were visited by Human 

Rights Watch. Belkais stated that other family members had also died. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shafiqa, a sister of Mushfeqa who was also wounded in the attack, told 

Human Rights Watch that in total nineteen members of the extended family 

had died and provided a list of names which included the names provided 

by Belqais and Mushfeqa as well as others. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another unrelated victim of the attack, located independently by Human 

Rights Watch, provided additional and confirming information of the 

incident. Sardar Bibi, aged about forty, is currently recovering in 

another hospital in Quetta. She told Human Rights Watch, &quot;I was wounded 

five days ago. It was at night, at about 11:30 or so, I don't know the 

exact time as we were sleeping. Suddenly the bombardment started. We 

went out of the house because we were afraid they would bombard the 

house. Then, we were running with our neighbors. Another bomb fell down. 

...The plane was circling and also shooting. First, a plane came and 

dropped a bomb, but the other plane kept circling.&quot; Her husband, Daulat 

Khan, and all of her six children were killed during the attack. Her 

children included two one-and-one-half-year-old twins, Mohammed Yasin 

and Mohammed Yusof, fourteen-year-old Akhter Bibi, fifteen-year-old 

Najia, sixteen-year-old Maimana, and eighteen-year-old Mariam. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She confirmed that there had been many civilian casualties in the 

village, and gave a similar death toll from one family as that given by 

the family interviewed by Human Rights Watch (see above): &quot;Many people 

died and many were wounded. Eighteen people died from our neighborhood, 

and seventeen others died who were relatives.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The incident in Chowkar-Karez village happened a day after twenty-three 

civilians, the majority of them children, were killed when U.S. bombs 

hit the remote Afghan village of Thori located near a Taliban military 

base in Oruzgan province (see Human Rights Watch release, &quot;Afghanistan: 

U.S. Bombs Kill Twenty-three Civilians,&quot; October 26, 2001 at

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge the Pentagon to investigate immediately what went wrong on 

October 22 and to take all feasible steps to avoid repetition of such a 

tragedy,&quot; said Jones.
