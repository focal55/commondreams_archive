<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 23 - The Democratic and Republican parties are raising larger amounts 

and higher proportions of soft money than ever before, according 

to a new study of campaign finance figures by the non-partisan 

Center for Responsive Politics.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fund-raising figures for the first six months of 2001 show that 

both parties intensified their efforts to raise soft money - 

the unlimited, largely unregulated contributions that campaign 

finance proposals currently pending in Congress threaten to ban 

or limit. Republican Party committees raised $65.8 million in 

soft money between January and June, more than double the soft 

money they raised over the same period in 1999, which marked 

the start of the presidential election cycle. Democrats raised 

$38.1 million in soft money in the first half of this year, a 

40 percent jump over 1999.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures show that the trend toward heavier party reliance 

on soft money has not slowed down since the record-breaking 2000 

elections. Soft money accounts for 54 percent of the Democrats' 

total so far in 2001 and 46 percent of the money raised by the 

Republicans. At this point two years ago, the Democrats had collected 

49 percent of their funds in soft money; for the Republicans 

it was 38 percent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hard money fundraising - which must conform with contribution 

limits and prohibitions - was also up in 2001, but not by as 

much. Republicans collected $77.6 million in hard money, up 54 

percent from 1999; Democrats raised $31.9 million, an increase 

of just 14 percent from two years ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All told, Republicans took in more than twice as much as Democrats 

between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year, collecting $143.4 million 

to the Democrats' $70.0 million. The GOP total, undoubtedly boosted 

by having a Republican in the White House, was a 76 percent increase 

over their take during the first six months of 1999. Democratic 

fund-raising was also up - but to a lesser degree - by 27 percent 

over 1999.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The totals are based on fund-raising reports filed by the Democratic 

and Republican National Committees, as well as the parties' congressional 

fundraising arms in the House and Senate. The figures come from 

the Federal Election Commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A complete look at party fund-raising for the 2002 elections 

can be found on the Center's Web site at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/index.asp" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/index.asp</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>LAWMAKERS' CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS ILLUSTRATE THE ADVANTAGES 

OF INCUMBENCY</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's analysis also shows that beating incumbents - never 

an easy proposition - is going to be tougher than ever in next 

year's mid-term elections, as House and Senate incumbents have 

built up huge war chests more than a year before Election Day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average House incumbent already has nearly $375,000 in the 

bank. Senate incumbents up for election in 2002 have an average 

of just over $1.0 million in cash on hand. That total includes 

the relatively paltry war chest of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), 

who just announced he will not seek reelection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures show that Republican members of the House of Representatives 

out-raised their Democratic colleagues by an average of 18 percent 

in the first six months of this year. With the 2002 midterm elections 

fast approaching and control of the House likely up for grabs, 

Republicans raised an average of nearly $220,000 versus the Democrats' 

average of just over $186,000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures are based on analysis of fundraising reports filed 

by members of Congress on July 31. They cover financial activity 

between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2001. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Center's other findings include the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who Raised the Most</b> - The House's most prolific fund-raiser over 

the first six months of this year was Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), 

with $1.7 million. Graham is a candidate for the Senate seat 

of Strom Thurmond (R), who is retiring at the end of the 107th 

Congress. On the Senate side, Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) led all 

others with $2.5 million raised. In 1998 Schumer defeated incumbent 

Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R) in one of the most expensive races ever.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Most Cash on Hand</b> - Four of the five House members with the most 

money in the bank are Democrats: No. 1 Peter Deutsch of Florida 

($2.4 million), No. 3 Robert Menendez of New Jersey ($2.2 million), 

No. 4 Martin Meehan of Massachusetts ($2.1 million), and No. 

5 Lloyd Doggett of Texas ($1.8 million). They each have a leg 

up on any possible opponents in 2002.  Interestingly, none of 

the top five senators in terms of cash on hand are up for election 

next year: Charles Schumer of New York ($6.7 million), Richard 

Shelby of Alabama ($6.0 million), Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas 

($4.6 million), Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts ($3.8 million), 

and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania ($3.4 million).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who Spent the Most</b> - The list of top spenders so far this year 

is rife with freshmen lawmakers who undoubtedly want to position 

themselves early on as strong contenders for re-election. The 

top three House spenders are all freshmen who won special elections 

this year: Randy Forbes (R-Va.), with nearly $1 million; Diane 

Watson (D-Calif.), with close to $865,000; and Bill Schuster 

(R-Pa.) at nearly $511,000. Two of the top three spenders in 

the Senate are freshmen: No. 1 Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), with 

just over $651,000, and No. 3 Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.) at nearly 

$555,000. No. 2 Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), who spent close to 

$645,000, is up for re-election in 2002 and is battling an investigation 

into alleged fund-raising improprieties during his 1996 campaign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Top Self-Funders</b> - Several lawmakers upped their fund-raising 

totals by lending or contributing personal funds to their campaign 

coffers. Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), who spent more than $60 million 

of his own money to win his seat last November, led all members 

of Congress in the first half of this year by reserving $238,000 

of his personal fortune for his campaign account. Also topping 

the six-figure mark were Sens. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.), with 

nearly $157,000; Deborah Stabenow (D-Mich.), with close to $141,000; 

and Herb Kohl of (D-Wis.) at $100,000. Rep. Robin Hayes (R-N.C.) 

led all House members with $150,000 in personal funds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Totals were not included for members who have not yet filed their 

six-month reports with the FEC. The above figures and others 

are available on the Center's Web site at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/2002elect/storysofar/" target="_new">http://www.opensecrets.org/2002elect/storysofar/</a>.
