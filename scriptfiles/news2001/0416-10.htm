- April 16 - News Advisory:

<p>WHAT:

Denis Hayes, founder and national coordinator of the first Earth

Day and current chair of Earth Day Network, says the United States

can't have it both ways when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and

global warming. Climate change is the focus of Earth Day 2001 this

Sunday, April 22. Tomorrow, April 17, Hayes, together with

environmental experts who track global energy development, will

release statements at the National Press Club charging that the

United States is not only failing to help curtail global warming

while complaining about greenhouse gas emissions from developing

countries, but also has a vested interest in actually increasing

emissions from those countries. The Bush administration recently

scuttled implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, complaining loudly

that the developing world wouldn't do its fair share to curb

greenhouse gas emissions under the treaty. But meanwhile, the United

States is quietly investing massive sums in new fossil-fueled power

projects in those countries which would guarantee rapid increases in

their emissions, accelerating climate change.

<p>WHO: Among other speakers, featured presenters giving statements

and interviews tomorrow will include:

<p>-- Denis Hayes, founder and national coordinator of the first

Earth Day in 1970 and currently CEO of Earth Day Network, former head

of the federal Solar Energy Research Institute (now the National

Renewable Energy Laboratory) during the Carter administration. He has

been interviewed widely in the media, including the "Today Show,"

where he is scheduled to appear on April 20. Hayes was selected by

Look Magazine has one of the most influential Americans of the 20th

century, and as "Hero of the Planet," by Time magazine.

<p>-- Daphne Wysham, fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies and

coordinator of its sustainable energy and economy network (SEEN), a

project of IPS and the Transnational Institute, Amsterdam. SEEN

challenges the "inevitability" of global warming by exposing how

public policy and public funding for energy projects in the

developing world are creating a "self-fulfilling prophecy" of rapidly

rising greenhouse gas emissions.

<p>WHEN and WHERE:

Tuesday, April 17, 1:45 p.m.

National Press Club, First Amendment Room

529 14th Street, NW, 13th floor

Washington, D.C.

Light refreshments will be served.

For details, contact Stephen Kent at 845-424-8382.

<p>Background:

<p>The U.S. government is the principal shareholder in the World

Bank, other international financial institutions (IFI's) and export

credit agencies backing massive new coal-burning plants and other

fossil-fueled energy projects throughout the developing world.

Research by the Institute for Policy Studies and other groups

critiquing the pattern of these investments in oil, gas and coal

projects has prompted the World Bank to propose an internal

"strategic review" of its carbon-heavy energy portfolio. Critics say

the planned large-scale investments will accelerate global warming,

choke off investment in emission-free renewable energy, and

recklessly endanger and displace local people and environments.

Producers of renewable energy, including solar, wind and small-scale

hydroelectric power, are releasing a statement certifying their power

is a fully commercializable, competitive alternative to fossil fuels

which warrants investment, but they are still denied the preferential

financing the World Bank, OPIC, Ex-Im and other financial

institutions have provided for decades to the fossil fuel sector. The

budget blueprint released by the White House last week slashes

federal funds for renewables development 50 percent, prompting

environmentalists to call urgently for IFI investments in renewables.

Kent of Kent Communications at 845-424-8382.
