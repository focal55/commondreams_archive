- March 7 - Only a day after the U.S. hinted that it would resume a policy of

engagement with North Korea, President Bush has abruptly changed course and

decided that name calling rather than negotiations is the best policy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his meeting today with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Bush labeled

North Korea a threat and indicated that the U.S. was not ready to resume

negotiations on ending the country's development and export of ballistic

missiles and related technologies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the U.S. does view North Korea as a threat, all the more reason to

accelerate negotiations, not postpone them,&quot; said Steve LaMontagne,

Non-Proliferation Research Analyst at Council for a Livable World Education

Fund. The Council is a Washington DC-based arms control advocacy

organization. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration's overnight shift in rhetoric will only make it more

difficult to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs,&quot; continued

LaMontagne</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secretary of State Colin Powell echoed the President's remarks, &quot;It [North

Korea] is a threat. It's got a huge army poised on the border within

artillery and rocket distance of South Korea.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Powell's remarks stand in sharp contrast to comments he made yesterday.&quot;We

do plan to engage with North Korea to pick up where President Clinton and

his administration left off,&quot; Powell said at a news conference. &quot;Some

promising elements were left on the table, and we'll be examining those

elements.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's comments come at a crucial time. The 1994 Agreed Framework, under

which North Korea suspended its nuclear weapons program in exchange for two

light-water reactors from an international consortium led by the U.S., is

being heavily criticized. Last month North Korea stated that it may end its

moratorium on missile tests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush Administration remarks threaten to push North Korea back into

isolation and antagonize it into resuming its pursuit of ballistic missiles

and nuclear weapons,&quot; LaMontagne argued.  &quot;North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il

is already upset at what it perceives as a hard-line stance from the Bush

administration.&quot; he added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information on the Agreed Framework and missile talks with North

Korea, please call or email for an issue brief.</font></p>
