- June 5 - Organizations across the country are raising serious

questions about the effects of welfare reform. In an effort to

better assess the success or failure of the 1996 Personal Responsibility

and Work Opportunity Act (PRWORA), the American Friends Service

Committee has released a compilation of the findings from a wide

cross-section of faith-based organizations, women's and civic

groups, government, private research and public policy institutions

nationwide. The verdict is clear. Most major groups that have

looked deeply into the impact of Temporary Assistance to Needy

Families (TANF) have recommended serious changes to the existing

program. 

<P>

&quot;It is alarming to see that, across-the-board, findings have

not been positive,&quot; states Kathryn Kurtz, AFSC associate

director of the Community Relations Unit. &quot;That holds true

regardless of the social or political leanings of the organization

conducting the study -- whether liberal or moderate, faith-based

or government, grassroots or academic, overall the message is

that TANF has not been adequate.&quot;

<P>

As Congress now revisits PRWORA with its first series of hearings

on the reauthorization process, it is crucial to view the human

impact of welfare reform in assessing its success or failure.

The facts are startling. In 1999, the year from which data is

most comprehensive: 

<UL>

<LI>More than half of employed former welfare recipients were

unable to pay rent, buy food, afford medical care and/or pay for

phone and electric service.

<LI>According to one study, only former recipients with at least

a two-year post-secondary or vocational degree were likely to

escape poverty by earnings alone.

<LI>Compared to their white counterparts, black recipients were

more likely to be required to take a pre-employment test, less

likely to obtain employment regardless of educational background

and less likely to report receiving job or educational information

from caseworkers.

<LI>Women leaving welfare earned an average of $6.75 an hour,

barely enough to raise a family of three above the federal poverty

line. Fifty-eight percent of employed former recipients had incomes

below the poverty line.

<LI>Requests for emergency food assistance increased by an average

of 17 percent in 2000, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Sixty-two percent of those requesting assistance were children

and their parents, and 32 percent of the adults were employed.

</UL>

<P>

The effects of welfare reform continue to unfold. The U.S. Census

Bureau reports that in 1999, 32 million Americans including 12

million children lived in poverty, despite strong growth in the

economy. While more than half of former recipients are now employed,

many families still face significant barriers to employment. The

findings challenge legislators and state policymakers to examine

traditional attitudes toward poverty and so-called &quot;welfare-to-work&quot;

programs. While specific points vary, many organizations advocate

similar reforms that include:

<OL>

<LI>Reward states for reducing poverty rates, not welfare rolls;

<LI>Establish federal requirements and accountability mechanisms

that cover eligibility, benefit levels, sanctions, services and

follow-up;

<LI>Consider the problems of women who are survivors of domestic

violence;

<LI>Restore benefits to eligible families, regardless of immigration

status;

<LI>Replicate policies that have proved effective in lifting families

out of poverty, including:

</OL>

<UL>

<LI>Increase the minimum wage as a first step toward establishing

a living wage

<LI>Expand the earned income tax credit

<LI>Increase access to post-secondary education

<LI>Increase access to affordable, quality child care

<LI>Increase transportation, rent, mortgage and/or utility subsidies

</UL>

<UL>

<LI>Replace arbitrary time-limits with case-by-case timelines

that acknowledge the multiple barriers many families face.

</UL>

<P>

As an organization grounded in Quaker beliefs, American Friends

Service Committee (AFSC) respects the dignity and worth of every

person. Consequently a view that blames individuals for these

economic realities is morally unacceptable. AFSC embraces a vision

that addresses the structural causes of poverty: low-wage jobs,

lack of universal health care, domestic violence and inadequate

public education, among others. Low-wage jobs without benefits

are not the answer to ending poverty.

<P>

&quot;The challenge, as proven by the results over the past five

years, is to develop a system that works to end poverty - not

one that simply pushes individuals off welfare rolls. We must

work toward a caring and equitable society,&quot; Kurtz states.

<P>

The compilation report, entitled &quot;Everyone is Deserving:

A Toolkit on TANF Reauthorization and Welfare Reform,&quot; is

an effort of the American Friends Service Committee Economic Justice

Network and Worker's Rights Committee in Hawai'i, and West Virginia,

and Indiana; the AFSC Women's Program and Community Relations

Unit; and the Grassroots Alliance to End Poverty. It is designed

to be a hands-on resource for organizations entering the debate

on welfare reform. For more information, contact Kathryn Kurtz,
