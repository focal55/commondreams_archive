- November 8 - Solar energy must be a key 

component of any U.S. plan aimed at creating energy independence 

and sparking the economy, according to a new Greenpeace study 

released today. The study, titled &quot;Solar Promise,&quot; illustrates the 

job creation and pollution cutting potential of solar energy by 

describing the benefits that would accrue to states that install a 

small solar array on just one of every 100 houses. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A small investment in solar power would light the way to energy 

independence, new jobs and reduced pollution for every state in the 

nation,&quot; said Kert Davies, Greenpeace Global Warming and Energy 

Campaign coordinator. &quot;Solar power is safe, practical and clean. 

And best of all, you don't have to import it or plunder precious 

wilderness to get it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Greenpeace study is available at 

<a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/energy/solar" target="_new">www.greenpeaceusa.org/energy/solar</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Voters in San Francisco handed the solar industry a ringing 

endorsement Tuesday by passing two ballot measures that provide 

funding for developing up to 50 megawatts (MW) of solar energy in 

the city. 50MW is enough power for 10,000 average homes. As a 

Nov. 6 article in The Wall Street Journal points out (&quot;Ballot 

Measures Would Give Solar Industry Big Boost&quot;), the San Francisco 

vote has national implications. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With today's vote, San Francisco has jumped ahead of the nation 

in starting to build an energy future independent of the whims of 

the big fossil fuel companies or the utilities,&quot; said Danny 

Kennedy, of Greenpeace's Clean Energy Now! campaign. &quot;California's 

strong step forward with renewable energy won't mean much if other 

states don't follow its lead.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recently published Greenpeace report shows the United States 

is in danger of losing the solar race to other countries in Europe 

and Asia where governments have taken an active roll in promoting 

solar energy. In the United States, Greenpeace found major 

differences between states in terms of the incentives they offer 

consumers for investing in solar power. States in the Sunbelt were 

not necessarily the most solar intensive states. For example, New 

York has more installed solar power than Florida; and Nevada, low 

on the solar power list now, has major projects planned in the near 

future.
