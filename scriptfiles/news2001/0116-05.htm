- January 16 - Nominees John Ashcroft, for Attorney General, and Tommy Thompson, for

Secretary of Health and Human Services, stand for some of the most regressive

policies on the ultra-conservatives' agenda.

<p>Ashcroft would ban birth control pills and IUDs, deny emergency contraception

to a woman who's been raped and force a girl, pregnant from incest, to

bear a child, even at the risk of her health. As Wisconsin governor Thompson

signed an abortion procedures ban like the one the U.S. Supreme Court–before

any Bush additions--found unconstitutionally deceptive and dangerous.

<p>While women need the right to birth control and abortion, we also need

to be able realistically to have and raise children. That means equal opportunity

and affirmative action; good jobs and equal pay; freedom from harassment,

discrimination, hate crimes and other violence; government that provides

programs--for the poor and the sick, people with disabilities, the very

young and the very old–equally to all.

<p>Confirmation of Ashcroft and Thompson would mean putting these dreams

on hold and could mean a rude awakening in their next elections for Senators

who vote "yes".

<p>Ashcroft, who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, used his position

as Missouri attorney general to try to deny NOW's first amendment rights

to call a boycott of states that had not ratified the ERA. He pursued his

lawsuit all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>Thompson engineered punitive welfare policies that hurt poor woman and

families and increased poverty and hunger in Wisconsin.

<p>Both Ashcroft and Thompson would turn over tax money--including public

education funds–to religious institutions' programs, without adequate protection

against proselytizing and discrimination. Do we want public funds to flow

to a homeless shelter that won't employ Jews and because of its religious

affiliation isn't required to do so? Should a tax-supported, Methodist-run

daycare center be able to exclude Moslem children? What about a Baptist

drug treatment program that uses its tax funding to hire men only?

<p>Neither nominee fights discrimination based on sexual orientation. Both

have flawed records on issues of race.

<p>The majority of voters in this country, especially women voters, reject

the agenda of religious and political extremists. NOW joins feminist and

women's organizations with millions of constituents all across the country

in calling on U.S. Senators to reject the nominations of Ashcroft and Thomas.
