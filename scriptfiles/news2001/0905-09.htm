- September 5 - Reverend Jesse Jackson and actor/civil rights activist Danny Glover 

have called on management of the Pacifica Radio Network to stop 

blocking the historic broadcasts of its daily radio show Democracy 

Now! from the UN World Conference Against Racism 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It’s unconscionable that Pacifica would not broadcast" Democracy 

Now!, "from these very important proceedings," said civil rights 

activist and actor Danny Glover, who is attending the conference. "The 

fact that Pacifica is not broadcasting Democracy Now! is appalling." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now! is the only radio program in the U.S. devoting its 

daily hour-long broadcast to live radio coverage from the UN World 

Conference Against Racism.  The show is broadcasting interviews with 

the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Danny Glover, Nobel Peace Prize Winner 

Rigoberta Menchu, women activists from India’s Dalit, or untouchable, 

caste, South African trade union leaders, and NGO activists from 

around the world. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It was not right for the U.S. to walk out, it was unnecessary for 

Israel to walk out," said  Reverend Jesse Jackson, "and Pacifica as 

the access  voice for racial and gender equality should not walk out, 

but should open up the airwaves and let people, let the Pacifica 

family hear these words."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The staff of Democracy Now! was suspended  without pay by Pacifica 

after leaving the studios of WBAI in New York to broadcast from an 

offsite location, following incidents of physical and verbal 

harassment against host Amy Goodman on August 10 and 13.   The 

American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), which 

represents Democracy Now! staff, has said that it is "no longer 

satisfied that the WBAI studios are a safe and appropriate working 

environment for the Democracy Now! staff."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since August 14, Pacifica management has refused to broadcast 

Democracy Now! and ordered its staff to return to WBAI. The majority 

of Pacifica affiliates, however, including Pacifica Station KPFA in 

San Francisco, continue to broadcast the show live in defiance of 

Pacifica’s national management.  On August 30 a majority of the 

Pacifica National Board ordered Pacifica Executive Director Bessie 

Wash to immediately resume broadcasting Democracy Now! and to restore 

the salaries of its staff. Ms. Wash continues to defy the Board’s 

directive.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now! is a daily national news program on the listener 

sponsored Pacifica Radio Network, and normally broadcasts from the 

studios of WBAI in New York City. The historically progressive network 

has recently been rocked by turmoil surrounding the firing and banning 

of longtime producers and staff, many of whom are people of color.
