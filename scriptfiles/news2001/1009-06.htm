- October 9 - The Green Party of the United

States has issued an official statement on the

September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the

Pentagon, and U.S. airlines.  The statement is printed

below.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The statement represents a broad consensus of the 33

states in the party's Coordinating Committee,&quot; said

Ben Manski, a Wisconsin Green and a member of the

national Steering Committee of the Green Party.  &quot;It

addresses the atrocities committed on September 11,

the surrounding issues, and what Greens believe is an

appropriate response that emphasizes justice instead

of vengeance, the safety of our people, the rule of

law, and a systematic approach to deterring terrorism.

 It urges President Bush and his Cabinet to respond to

the attacks as crimes against humanity punishable

under international law, rather than a motivation for

war -- which would result in many more civilian

deaths.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

GREEN PARTY STATEMENT On The September 11th Events</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States is shocked by the

terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. We extend our

deepest sympathy to those most personally affected by

these horrific events. We remember especially the

injured, the loved ones of those who have died, the

innocents who lost their lives in the midst of an

ordinary day's work, and those heroic firefighters,

police officers and other relief workers who gave

their lives unquestioningly. These were our neighbors,

co-workers, friends and family members. As Americans

and as members of the human family, we are all

irrevocably affected by this terror.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREEN PARTY URGES ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens fully support the right and obligation of the

U.S. to seek justice. The complete disregard for the

sanctity of human life displayed by the perpetrators

of these atrocities must be countered by a just and

lawful response. Justice is the goal and mark of a

civilized society. Thus, we call on the United States

Government to exercise caution and restraint as we

form a response to these attacks. Indiscriminate

military actions and acts of vengeance would only

escalate violence and generate additional hatred.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, a unilateral and indiscriminate military

response, especially on the Afghan or Arab peoples,

can easily be misperceived as an attack on Islam. 

This would undermine international support for the US,

further fanaticism and terrorism and ultimately

imperil the possibility of peace in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, we believe that the September 11, 2001

attacks on innocent civilians should, in accordance

with domestic and international law, be characterized

as an international crime against humanity, not a war.

A full investigation, undertaken with international

cooperation, must take place before the President and

Congress attempt to bring those responsible to

justice. Accordingly, the identification of any

perpetrator of these offenses and their supporters

must be based on solid and credible evidence not by

innuendo or conviction in the media. A sound legal

case must be made and brought to federal and

international courts for arrest and  extradition as

necessary. American declarations of war inhibit rather

than promote this international cooperation. Attempts

to unilaterally seek redress through bombs and

missiles, rather than a court of law, will undermine

international law, and set back recent international

successes in bringing those who have committed crimes

against humanity to justice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Accordingly, the Green Party specifically opposes any

attempt by President Bush to wage war outside the

scrutiny of Congress and the American public for whom

they speak. The U.S. Constitution addresses war powers

explicitly and does not, under any interpretation,

allow a president a &quot;blank check&quot; power to wage war. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GREENS FEAR EROSION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AT HOME</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No matter who the perpetrators of the September

attacks prove to be, unjust attacks in the U.S. or

abroad against Arab-Americans, Arabs, Muslims or

anyone else of Middle Eastern ancestry are

unacceptable and un-American.  Therefore, we encourage

President Bush and other public officials to continue

to denounce sentiments and behavior that target ethnic

or religious groups in revenge for the September 11th

attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The September 11th attacks struck out at American

democracy as well as the World Trade Center and

Pentagon. By definition, terrorism opposes

representative government, undermines civil liberties,

and represses religious freedom and ethnic diversity.

Therefore, our response to terrorism must not erode

these very same civil liberties and constitutional

rights. While we understand the immediate need for

measures like increased airport security, we oppose

any restriction on civil political dissent, which

would, in effect, make democratic accountability a

casualty of the September 11th attacks. Critical, open

and honest civic debate about our past and future

policy is essential to a solid and lasting democracy.

We urge our fellow citizens to  be vigilant in

supporting our civil liberties, which are always

vulnerable during times of conflict.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS TO TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE AGAINST

CIVILIANS</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While there is never any justification for acts of

terror against innocent civilians -- indeed it is the

quintessential act of dehumanization -- the events of

September 11th bring Americans the unique occasion to

reconsider our government's role on the world stage. 

The Green Party calls attention to the fact that, even

in the midst of our national anger, grief, and fear,

the US remains the most militarily powerful and

influential country in the world at present. In accord

with this and our identity as a leading defender of

democracy, we have the obligation to act

democratically and model moral and just standards for

others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, in seeking to prevent further terrorist attacks

in the US and elsewhere, the Green Party urges our

nation to reassess our government's policies and

actions, which at worst, may have served to justify

terrorism in the minds of our attackers and their

sympathizers, and at least, may continue to be sources

of frustration and anger for many freedom-seeking

peoples around the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party asserts that a significant aspect of

preventing future terrorist attacks on the United

States is to insure that our foreign policy is firmly

based on economic and social justice. Specifically, we

call on the U.S. to end the economic sanctions against

Iraq which have resulted in the death of over a half

million innocent Iraqi children and civilians. We also

call on the U.S. to insist that international law be

strictly observed with regard to the

Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, the Green Party of the United States

urges our fellow citizens and people everywhere to

view September 11th as an opportunity to call for an

end to all violence towards civilians. As our platform

states, the Green Party seeks strength through peace

and asserts that security and liberty prosper

together. While we recognize the need for self-defense

and the defense of others who are in helpless

situations, we trust that non-violence provides the

surest road to peace. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, at this turning point in world affairs, we

strongly urge President Bush to lead the world

forward, toward a realignment of peoples and nations,

not backward into an era of military and economic

conquest characterized by endless violence. We can

signal this new era with a declaration strictly

banning the targeting of civilians and non-combatants

and the use of weapons of mass destruction.  This new

era can be  sustained by a rededication of our vast

resources away from producing more weapons and towards

eradicating the poverty, disease and ignorance that

foster despair and insecurity for most of the world's

people. Finally, we urge people and governments around

the world to join us in the most pressing challenge of

this new millennium: to create a culture of peace. It

is in meeting these demands of peace, that we will

know what peace truly is. The deaths of over 6000

innocents demand it.</font></p>
