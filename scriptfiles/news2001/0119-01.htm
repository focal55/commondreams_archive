- January 19 - Six  Greenpeace France activists were arrested earlier today  when they entered the heavily protected secure zone  around the nuclear transport freighter Pacific Pintail, in the port Cherbourg on the Normandy coast.  

<p>The British flagged ship which arrived at 06.00 (CET) is currently being loaded with deadly plutonium/MOX fuel, in readiness for a 30,000km voyage to Japan later today. 

<p>At around 9.30 am (CET), activists in Greenpeace inflatables and canoes carrying radiation symbols and a "Stop Plutonium" banner evaded armed security to protest  alongside the vessel. Swimmers carrying radiation symbol flags jumped from the inflatables and approached the ship. The ship and plutonium cargo were being protected by around 30 French armed marine commandos in 5 boats inside the security zone. A further 50 marine commandos were on the dockside. 

<p>The swimmers and canoeists were all arrested by the commandos after protesting for half an hour, but the inflatables evaded security, despite being chased by sea  borne French forces.  

<p>"The plutonium industry is out of control. Neither Japan nor France receive any benefit from this deadly trade, but both  governments and the nuclear industry are threatening the environment and health of millions of people living in coastal communities along the entire 30,000km route by allowing this transport to go ahead. It’s time this madness was stopped." said Yannick Rousselet of Greenpeace in  Cherbourg.
