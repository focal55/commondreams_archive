- January 2 - News Advisory:

<p>What:

<br>

Press Briefing: How Big is the Available Budget Surplus and How

Large a Tax Cut Can it Accommodate?

<p>When:

<br>10 a.m. Thursday, January 4, 200l

<p>Where:

<br>Holeman Lounge

<br>National Press Club

<p>Speakers:

<br>

-- Robert Greenstein, executive director, Center on Budget and

Policy Priorities

<br>

-- Robert Bixby, executive director, Concord Coalition

<br>-- William Gale, senior fellow, Brookings Institution

<p>Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,

Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition, and William Gale of the

Brookings Institution will discuss the implications of an expected

increase in projected budget surpluses at a briefing in the Holeman

Lounge of the National Press Club at 10 a.m. Thursday, Jan. 4,

<br>

2001.

<p>At the event, the Center will release a new study, "Can The New

Surplus Projections Accommodate A Large Tax Cut?", which evaluates

how much is likely to be available for new initiatives under

forthcoming Congressional Budget Office surplus estimates, and

whether the available surplus is likely to be sufficient to

accommodate the Bush tax cut.

<p>CBO is expected to issue new projections later this month.

<p>The center's analysis and the briefing will examine three

questions:

<p>1) How big are the projected non-Social Security surpluses

likely to be under the new CBO projections?

<p>2) How much of that amount will actually be available for new

initiatives, including a tax cut?

<p>3) How does this anticipated surplus compare to the magnitude of

the tax cut proposed by President-elect Bush during the campaign?

<p>For additional information, please contact Jim Jaffe

jaffe@cbpp.org or Michelle Bazie bazie@cbpp.org in the

center's communications office, 202-408-1080.
