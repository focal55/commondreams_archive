- September 6 - Job seekers, home buyers, 

low- and moderate-income families, and the economy as a whole will 

benefit from creation of a National Housing Trust Fund, a new study 

by <a href="http://www.communitychange.org/default.asp" target="_new">Center for Community Change</a> (CCC) finds. The study indicates a new $5 billion fund would generate 1.8 million jobs and nearly $50 

billion in wages. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Home Sweet Home: Why America Needs a National Housing Trust 

Fund&quot; will be simultaneously released by CCC in Washington, D.C. in 

House Capitol Room 9 at 11 a.m. and by 44 groups in 29 states 

throughout the country today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study is part of a campaign by more than 1,300 grassroots 

groups and others who advocate creating a federal version of a more 

than 20-year-old state and local affordable housing funding vehicle 

that has a 99.8 percent success rate and leverages on average $9 

for every $1 of direct investment. 36 states and more than 100 

cities and counties have used housing trust funds to build more 

than 200,000 units of affordable housing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I worked very hard to get a housing trust fund passed in St. 

Louis on the same day I was elected mayor because we need 

affordable housing for working families, seniors and the disabled 

in St. Louis,&quot; says St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay. &quot;However, even 

though we now have the largest per capita housing trust fund in the 

country, St. Louis' housing need cannot be met by us alone. 

Congress must meet us half-way and create a national affordable 

housing trust fund also.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;America lacks affordable housing,&quot; says Maude Hurd, president 

of Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), 

responsible for about a quarter of today's actions and news 

conferences supporting a National Housing Trust Fund. &quot;Now an 

opportunity to create it has come along just when the economy could 

use the shot in the arm all that investment and all those jobs can 

provide.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Housing trust funds have three characteristics: dedicated 

sources of ongoing funding, a commitment to production and 

preservation of affordable housing, and the fact that they 

represent money not otherwise used to address housing needs. 

Typically, housing trust funds are funded with real estate transfer 

taxes, developers' fees, contributions, and other sources. 

Advocates of the idea note that governmental bodies often earmark funds for certain projects, such as using gas taxes for road and 

highway projects, and that housing needs similar priority. </font></p>
