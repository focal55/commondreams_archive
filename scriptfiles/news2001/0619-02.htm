<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1981, the Common Cause Public Service Achievement Award has recognized individuals &quot;who by the force of imagination, initiative, and perseverance have made an outstanding contribution to the public interest in the areas of government performance and integrity.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Award has historically been given both to nationally known figures as well as community activists and local government officials. Past recipients include reform activist Doris &quot;Granny D&quot; Haddock, former DC Inspector General E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr., the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Paul Volcker for his work as chairman of the National Commission on Public Service, among many others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To further honor Gardner, who founded Common Cause in 1970 and chaired the organization until 1977, the award will be renamed the John Gardner Public Service Award.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;John Gardner has done more to shape the landscape of the nonprofit advocacy community than any other individual in America,&quot; Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said.&quot;All of us at Common Cause are honored by our longstanding association with John Gardner, and all Americans have been enriched by his service to his country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We honor not only the man, but his vision for our democracy and the inspiration he has provided to thousands of Americans who have chosen careers in the public interest, and for the living proof he provides of the most important notion he brought to Common Cause - the notion that every person can make a difference.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Renaming our award for public service in his name is a modest yet fitting way to express our appreciation not only for his contributions to Common Cause but for his lifetime of service,&quot; Harshbarger said.</font></p>
