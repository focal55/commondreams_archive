- April 11 - Negotiations on the

Kyoto Protocol are alive and well in spite of the recent statements

from the Bush Administration. The latest evidence of this comes in

the form of the most recent proposal by the President of the

negotiations, Minister Pronk from The Netherlands. Minister Pronk

has presented a new proposal on rules for the treaty that will be

discussed in a closed ministerial meeting in New York on Saturday.

WWF is working on a detailed analysis of the proposal, which will

be released shortly.

<p>"This proposal demonstrates that the Kyoto Protocol is the basis

for international negotiations, despite the Bush Administration

attempts to take it off the table. The Bush Administration should

either engage constructively on this basis, or get out of the way

and let the rest of the world move forward," said Jennifer Morgan,

director of WWF's Climate Change Campaign. "The Administration's

sentiments are clearly out of touch with the fears and concerns of

the American public and the vast majority of the world."

<p>Dutch Environment Minister Jan Pronk will maintain the

Presidency of the climate negotiations regarding the rules for

implementing the Kyoto Protocol. These negotiations stalled in The

Hague last November and will resume in the Bonn this July. Over 150

countries including the United States have signed the protocol, and

polls consistently demonstrate that Americans want action to

address global warming. However, both the President and EPA

Administrator have stated their firm opposition to the Kyoto

Protocol and reversed a campaign pledge that would have cut carbon

dioxide emissions from power plants.
