- June 21 - While President Bush is claiming his budget fully funds

the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), the Bush Administration is

actually cutting funding for federal land purchases.  Appearing before

cameras at Alabama's Oak Mountain State Park, Bush today trumpets &quot;full

funding&quot; for the LWCF at $900 million, but in fact his budget proposal

would take money from other important conservation programs to fund LWCF,

and would actually decrease funding for the critical federal portion of

LWCF.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would be more honest for the President to label his budget what it is

-- a serious cut in the federal commitment to protect our National Parks,

wildlife refuges and other special places for all Americans,&quot; said Carl

Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director.  &quot;Robbing popular conservation

programs to claim full funding for LWCF is one more bait and switch by the

Bush administration.  While he's increasing a little in one pot of money,

he's slashing funding for public lands protection elsewhere.  Americans

won't be fooled by his token actions and photo shoots -- they clearly see

the full picture of President Bush's failure to protect the environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush budget would provide more money to states to spend from the LWCF,

but only by shortchanging other crucial federal conservation programs,

including the program that funds federal land acquisitions needed to

protect our National Parks, wildlife refuges, and other public lands.

Federal land management agencies are in desperate need of federal dollars

to carry out these critical acquisitions</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the Administration's LWCF proposal plays a budgetary shell

game.  The proposal lumps other important conservation programs into the

LWCF account without adding enough money to fund those programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, other conservation programs that would be victim to Bush's

shell game include the program to provide wildlife protection grants to

states.  Last year, the Interior Department budget gave $100 million to the

state wildlife protection program.  This year, the Bush budget gives

Interior no money for this wildlife protection program.  Instead, if states

want to fund these wildlife protections, they would have to take the money

from their LWCF grant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Last year, Congress reached a historic, balanced and bipartisan

conservation funding agreement, committing $12 billion over 6 years to the

Land and Water Conservation Fund and other valued conservation programs,&quot;

Pope added.  &quot;Now not only does President Bush reject this agreement, but

he puts less money on the table and tries to call it more.  When it comes

to the National Parks and wildlands we leave for our children, Americans

want honesty, not pretty photo-ops that hide budgetary double-counting.&quot;
