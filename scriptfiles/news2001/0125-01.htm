- January 25 - The following was

released today by the National Abortion Federation:

<p>-- Widow Of Slain Abortion Provider Adds Her Voice To Those

Opposing Confirmation Of John Ashcroft As U.S. Attorney General

<p>-- National Abortion Federation Calls on Senators to Protect

the Lives of Abortion Providers and Vote Against Confirmation of

John Ashcroft

<p>The widow of Dr. Barnett Slepian issued a statement today

voicing her opposition to John Ashcroft as U.S. Attorney

General. "I have rarely spoken to the media in the two years

since my husband's death," said Lynne Slepian. "My deep concern

for the men and women who perform abortion services, whose lives

could be endangered by this appointment, and my sense of

outrage, compel me to speak out today against the nomination of

John Ashcroft as Attorney General."

<p>In her statement, Slepian asked, "How can someone who

believes abortion is murder fully enforce the laws that protect

those who perform abortions? How can my family rely on John

Ashcroft to provide all of the resources necessary to catch my

husband's murderer? How will John Ashcroft prevent further

tragedies like the one that took my husband's life?" She also

stated that she fears that the Task Force will not continue its

work if Ashcroft is confirmed. She added, "I am afraid of what

will happen to other abortion providers if the laws protecting

them are not fully enforced. And, I am afraid for the women who

may be denied access to safe abortion care as a result of an

increase in anti-choice violence and harassment."

<p>Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion

Federation, added her fears about a Justice Department headed by

Ashcroft. "We do not believe Ashcroft will continue the

commitment of the Department of Justice to deterring acts of

violence against abortion providers. The Justice Department,

and the Task Force in particular, has been instrumental in

protecting the lives and safety of our members and the women

they serve. Not only has the Task Force prevented violence, but

it has also devoted critical resources to apprehending those who

have committed acts of violence."

<p>"Two days of testimony cannot supersede 25 years of public

office," said Saporta. "John Ashcroft's history of using his

positions of power to impose his extreme ideology shows he

cannot be entrusted with the lives of those who perform

abortions and those who seek their care. We join Lynne Slepian

in calling on Senators to protect women and abortion providers

and reject Ashcroft's nomination."

<p><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional

association of abortion providers in the US and Canada dedicated

to ensuring that abortion remains safe, legal and accessible.
