- June 11 - Students, educators, financial aid administrators and

members of congress are asking newspaper editors to make the case for

repealing the 1998 Higher Education Act drug provision.  According to

new Department of Education data, the number of students at risk of

losing financial aid in the 2001 &#150; 2002 year due to past misdemeanor or

felony drug convictions has increased dramatically.  The Coalition for

Higher Education Act Reform says that new data confirms their

predictions, made last year, that strict enforcement of the 1998 HEA

drug provision would result in loss of aid by tens of thousands of

students.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a recent letter sent to new Drug Enforcement Administration head Asa

Hutchinson, 13 leading education associations representing admissions

officers, community and state colleges, financial aid administrators and

student groups, called the 1998 Higher Education Act drug provision a

&#147;fundamentally flawed piece of legislation.&#148;   Students for Sensible

Drug Policy has grown to 140 chapters on college campuses and have

launched a major campaign (http://www.raiseyourvoice.com) to pressure

members of congress to support the repeal measure.  On campus, 69

student governments have passed resolutions in support of repealing the

HEA drug provision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here&#146;s what some editors are saying about the Higher Education Act drug

provision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Students who&#146;ve already paid the criminal penalties for drug

convictions &#150; through drug treatment, prohibition, community service or

time in jail &#150; are being made to pay again through the loss of college

aid.  That prevents them from following a productive path that may be

the best insurance against recidivism. And the hammer falls unequally on

college students, putting up a barrier to higher education for convicted

students who are poor and need financial aid that doesn&#146;t exist for

convicted students who are better off.&#148; &#150; The Fresno Bee, May 27, 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s a merciless crackdown with the worst possible motives.  People go

to college to improve their lives, as positive s step as anyone can

take.  It requires commitment, and, for many who&#146;ve never gone that

route, a great deal of courage.  For those who&#146;ve previously been

arrested for whatever reason, college can be the turnaround of their

life.  Now the government is singling out some of those people and

telling them not to bother.&#148; &#150; The Gainesville Sun, April 29, 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This amounts to an additional penalty for drug use, applied only to

those of modest enough income to need federal help. Though Rep. Souder

said his intent was to apply this sanction only to students already

receiving aid, the law has been interpreted to cover first-time

applicants too. So this provision could have the effect of cutting off

students who are trying to overcome past troubles with drugs and pursue

the education that will help them get ahead. They ought to get help, not

hindrance.&#148;  &#150; The Washington Post, April 26, 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Such uneven &#150; and unfair &#150; enforcement is a predictable consequence of

lawmakers&#146; attempt to use federal financial aid to engineer student

behavior.&#148; &#150; USA Today, June 13, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also available for interview: Student government leaders, students who

have been denied aid, and student activists representing SSDP, NAACP and

other organizations. For further information contact Shawn Heller (SSDP)
