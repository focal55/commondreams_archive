- February 6 - President Bush's proposal

to eliminate the estate tax would benefit only the top 5 percent of

tax filers and do nothing for the overwhelming majority of women

and their families who do not stand to gain from inherited wealth,

the National Women's Law Center said today. Moreover, the size of

the proposed tax cut would deplete funds for programs that women

and their families depend on.

<p>"To bill this aspect of the plan as 'helping families' is

somewhat misleading. Women and their families are

disproportionately in the middle and lower income brackets that

won't be helped at all by this change," said Nancy Duff Campbell,

NWLC co-president. "Over one-quarter of the money in the proposed

tax cut comes from the elimination of the estate tax, but all of

the benefit would go to a small handful of wealthy Americans."

<p>"It's not the estate tax that is keeping the vast majority of

American families from preserving their assets. It's the

staggering costs of health care, including long term care and the

other costs associated with catastrophic illnesses, especially as

people age, that is depleting family assets -- and these are the

types of issues we should be addressing instead of a tax cut," said

Campbell.

<p>Campbell added, "The size of the proposed tax cut poses not only

a threat to money for health care, but also to funds for Social

Security, Medicare and other safety net programs and programs that

are critical to women and their families such as education and

child care." Women have a greater stake in these federal programs

because they tend to earn less during their lifetimes, live longer,

and are more likely to bear the burden of uncompensated family

care-taking responsibilities.

<p>Campbell has almost 30 years' experience in tax law and policy,

especially as it pertains to women and their families. She serves

on the board of the Community Tax Law Report and chaired the

national Coalition on Women and Taxes during the 1986 tax reform

debates.
