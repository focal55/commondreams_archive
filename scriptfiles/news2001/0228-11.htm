- February 28 - President George W. Bush released his overall figures for the fiscal 2002 budget request today, providing the largest increase for the Department of Defense.  Total military spending, including Department of Energy nuclear weapons related activities, will rise $14.2 billion to $324.8 billion.<br><br>President Bush was criticized for not providing a larger increase for military programs after he announced this month that he would use the Clinton Administration's projected 2002 defense budget.  <br><br>"While the Pentagon and many in Congress may not approve, $14 billion is real money to the American taxpayer,"  said John Isaacs, President of the defense reform group Council for a Livable World. "In fact it's greater than all federal expenditures on law enforcement or the combined defense budgets of all seven ‘states of concern.'"<br><br>While the Pentagon received nearly a five percent increase, many other federal departments suffered cuts under Bush's proposed budget.  The Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior, Justice, Labor and Transportation all have funding reduced under Bush's plan.  The President's proposed budget also slashes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  <br><br>"The U.S. is spending more on defense than the next 12 countries combined," Isaacs argued, "We spend more than three times the amount of all our potential enemies combined.  Military spending has reached almost 95 percent of the Cold War average.  In fact, the Pentagon budget is greater now then it was when Mr. Rumsfeld finished his first term as Secretary of Defense in the Ford Administration."<br><br>Moreover, Congress will likely increase the request.  Each of the last two years Congress has added $4.5 billion to the President's request for defense and passed multi-billion dollar "emergency" defense spending bills.  "President Bush has already provided a sizable boost for the Pentagon and should not succumb to Congressional pressure to add more," continued Isaacs.<br><br>Increases in defense spending simply are not necessary to strengthen national defense. Eliminating billions in unneeded Cold War era weapons could free up funds for other priorities such as readiness and advanced weapons research.  Fixing the Pentagon's accounting problems would save billions while solving spare parts problems.  Closing unnecessary bases will save $3 billion annually and removing "Buy America" provisions that require the procurement of products made in the U.S. could save $5 billion a year.  According to Sen. John McCain (R- AZ), the Senate's top pork buster, Congress added $7 billion in unrequested spending to the fiscal 2001 defense spending bill.
