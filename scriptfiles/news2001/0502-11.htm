- May 2 -  "President Bush's plan to deploy a US national missile defense system 

that will eventually lead to the US withdrawal of the 1972 Anti-

Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty turns the military order of 'Ready, Aim, 

Fire' on its head.

<p>"No national missile defense system is anywhere near ready to deploy.  

The Clinton administration's proposed land-based system, which is to 

become the backbone of Bush's plan, is furthest in development, but 

failed two out of three tests and is years behind schedule. The other 

possible components of the Bush plan -- sea-based and space-based 

systems and boost phase proposals -- are only on the drawing board or 

in peoples' imagination.  Research should continue, but at this point 

all proposed systems are either untested or unproven.</p>



<p>"There is no reason to abrogate the ABM treaty anytime soon, since it 

will take years to determine which, if any, of these NMD systems are 

viable and worth the security costs of breaking out of the ABM Treaty.</p>



<p>"And those security costs would be extremely large.  The prospect of a 

'Star Wars'-type NMD system will lead Russia to maintain a large 

arsenal of offensive missiles on high alert. The US intelligence 

community predicts that, in response to NMD, China is likely to 

increase its nuclear force tenfold. And Russia has warned it will 

withdraw from the START treaties that have eliminated thousands of 

Russian nuclear-armed missiles.  US efforts to control the spread of 

Russian nuclear weapons and materiel would be in tatters.  The NMD 

'cure' is far worse than the 'disease'.</p>



<p>"Bush's proposal to reduce the US nuclear arsenal is vitally important 

and welcome.  But Bush's aggressive NMD plan will block deep cuts in 

Russia's nuclear arsenal and efforts to take their weapons off hair-

trigger alert.  By focusing on the 'rogue' threat, the Bush 

administration may exacerbate the key threat to US security today: the 

danger from the large Russian arsenal on high alert.</p>



<p>"The US should give the highest priority to reducing Russia's nuclear 

arsenal, to inducing Russia to take its missiles off alert, and to 

preventing proliferation from Russia. In its urge to rush the 

deployment of NMD, whether it will be effective or not, the Bush 

administration has its priorities exactly backward."</p>

<p><i>NOTE: More than 30 scientists and missile experts will converge at the

US Capitol for a press conference tomorrow to tell lawmakers that there 

is no scientific basis for building any of the proposed NMD systems. 

The press conference/award ceremony is on Wednesday, May 2, at 1:30 PM 

in Room 189 of the Russell Senate Office Building.</i>
