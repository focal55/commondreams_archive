- January 9 - The Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in Space and

Veterans for Peace, with the support of  peace groups around the world,  are

calling on the U.S. Senate to reject the appointment of  Donald Rumsfeld as

the next U.S. Secretary of Defense charging that he is a “Star Wars zealot”

who will cause a new arms race and ultimately war in space.



</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Rumsfeld has been the agent of the right-wing and corporate forces

that have been pushing for Star Wars,” declared Bruce Gagnon, Coordinator of

the Global Network. “It was Rumsfeld who, in 1998, was appointed by

arch-conservatives Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to chair a commission that

insisted on prompt deployment of a missile defense system. The Commission's

findings undermined earlier CIA analyses that threats of attack from 'rogue

states' were not iminent, eventually forcing the CIA to change its

projections."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Rumsfeld was then given the ‘Keeper of the Flame’ award by the

pro-Star Wars right-wing Center for Security Policy,” noted Gagnon, “an

operation funded by the aerospace corporations that seeks to become Star

Wars contractors and which has listed Rumsfeld as a ‘trusted advisor’ and a

financial supporter.”  Rumsfeld recently chaired a second Space Commission,

made up of former Space Command leaders, that insists that the U.S. needs

anti-satellite weapons to protect U.S. "space assets."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Rumsfeld supports U.S. plans to ‘control space’  in violation of the

intent of the United Nations' Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which sets aside

space for ‘peaceful purposes,’ and which the U.S. not only has signed but

was a leader in initiating. With Rumsfeld in charge of the Pentagon, we will

see a push for the weaponization of space that will lead to an arms race in

space.  Other nations will not submit to having the U.S. ‘control space’.

The real fight to stop Star Wars begins with the issue of Senate approval of

Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of  Defense."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Shaw of  Veterans for Peace said that “our members know what war

is about” and described Rumsfeld as a “radical operative of the military

industry complex who opposes the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, testified

against the chemical weapons convention, opposed the SALT II arms agreement,

and lobbied for the B-2 Bomber and the MX Missile--and has carried the flame

for Star Wars. The United States and the world cannot afford this extreme

agenda."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Karl Grossman, author of a soon-to-be-released book, “Weapons In Space”

(Seven Stories Press) which includes information on Rumsfeld and his Star

Wars links, said that “as The Washington Post has just reported, Rumsfeld is

the ‘leading proponent not only of national missile defenses, but also of

U.S. efforts to take control of outer space."   Grossman, a professor of

journalism at the State University of New York, said that “we must focus on

strengthening the Outer Space Treaty, bolstering it by banning all weapons

from space. Our neighbor Canada is a leader in this call at  the United

Nations.  With Rumsfeld as defense secretary, the U.S. will be moving in the

other direction: toward war in space.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Global Network and Veterans for Peace are calling on the Senate

Armed Services Committee, and thereafter the full U.S. Senate, to reject

Rumsfeld. They are organizing a grassroots campaign in which people across

the United States are contacting their U.S. senators and expressing their

opposition to the Bush appointment of Rumsfeld.
