- June 6 - The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a national grassroots advocacy organization, today heralded the California Senate's vote to require that all new handgun owners in that state obtain a safety license.  The bill, SB 52, was authored by Senator Jack Scott (D-Altadena), and co-sponsored by the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Handgun Control, Inc. and the Million Mom March.

<p>The Senate approved the safety licensing system by a bipartisan vote of 25-15. The bill now goes to the Assembly for consideration.</p>

	<p>"We applaud the California State Senate's courage to pass handgun safety licensing," said Michael Beard, President of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.  "We hope the Assembly passes, and Governor Davis signs, this important piece of legislation."</p>

	<p>Handgun safety licensing is designed to reduce irresponsible gun use by requiring all new handgun buyers to undergo safety training, and to demonstrate their ability to safely use and store guns.  This training is important in helping gun-owning parents keep firearms away from kids, especially troubled youth who may use guns against themselves or others.</p>

	<p>Under SB 52, new handgun buyers would also have to provide local police with their name, address, and thumbprint - identification requirements that will serve as a strong deterrent for criminals looking to get guns.</p>

	<p>"Law enforcement officers in California, and across the country, know that stronger laws are needed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals," said Police Chief Larry Todd, Firearm Issues Committee Chair of the California Police Chiefs Association.  "Handgun safety licensing is just a matter of common sense."</p>

	<p>The success of Senator Scott's bill is due to the diverse support it has received from statewide law enforcement and public health organizations within the state.  The California Police Chiefs Association, California Organization of Police and Sheriffs, and the American Academy of Pediatrics California District have all signed onto the bill because it will help reduce criminal and child access to handguns.</p>

	<p>"If handgun safety licensing is passed into law, California will join 12 other states that have already enacted this important policy," Beard said.  "We must institute this policy at the federal level, however, to ensure that criminals and children across the country are denied the easy access they currently have to handguns."</p>

	<p>At the national level, Senator Diane Feinstein (D - CA) has introduced legislation that would establish a federal system to license gun owners and register new handguns - a measure that would go even further in promoting responsible gun use and reducing criminal access to guns.</p>

	<p>Additional information about handgun licensing and registration is available by contacting the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence at 202-408-0061 ext. 118.</p>
