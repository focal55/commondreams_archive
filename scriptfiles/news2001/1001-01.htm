<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 1 -  More than 150 campus 

and community events across the country today launched a 

campaign to force the gun industry to take responsibility for 

its deadly products. A new student organization, &quot;Gun Industry 

Watch,&quot; will monitor gun industry and National Rifle Association 

(NRA) practices surrounding the manufacturing, marketing, and 

sale of guns and will take direct action aimed at gun makers and 

the gun lobby. Today's campus rallies were part of the First 

Monday Campaign, an annual day of action organized by the 

Alliance for Justice with Physicians for Social Responsibility. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nearly thirty thousand Americans die every year from gun 

violence,&quot; said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice. 

&quot;It's time to demand the industry take responsibility for its 

deadly products. It makes sense that students who have been 

leading the call for greater corporate social responsibility, 

should lead the way in demanding accountability from America's 

most unregulated and dangerous industry.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make its case against the gun industry, the First Monday 

Campaign also released a new documentary film, &quot;Deadly 

Business,&quot; that exposes industry abuses. The 30-minute film by 

award-winning documentary filmmaker Glen Pearcy reveals how the 

gun industry and gun lobby work together to ensure that guns 

remain the least regulated and most lethal product sold in 

America. The film draws powerful parallels between the 

misleading marketing tactics of the gun industry and the tobacco 

industry. &quot;Deadly Business&quot; was shown at today's campus rallies 

and will be premiered at a Monday evening screening in 

Washington, D.C. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;First Monday is activating a new generation of Americans 

willing to take action to make our future safer,&quot; said Robert K. 

Musil, Ph.D, MPH, CEO and executive director of Physicians for 

Social Responsibility. &quot;Through 'Gun Industry Watch' students 

are focusing their energies on the real culprit behind America's 

epidemic of gun injury and death: the gun industry.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the coming months, student members of &quot;Gun Industry Watch&quot; 

will take the lead on organizing grassroots activities aimed at 

gun manufacturers and the gun lobby, including: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Exposing deceptive advertising used by gun makers; 

-- Boycotting corporate partners and sponsors of the gun 

lobby; 

-- Demanding consumer product safety standards for firearms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the same way that a dedicated group of activists exposed 

the tobacco industry and changed America's smoking culture, it's 

time to expose the gun industry and change America's gun 

culture,&quot; said Aron. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First Monday is an annual, campus-based campaign that focuses 

on social justice issues and takes place on the first Monday in 

October to coincide with the opening day of the U.S. Supreme 

Court. More than 140 national and state groups have 

co-sponsored First Monday 2001, including the Brady Campaign, 

the Million Mom March, the National Education Association, the 

American Bar Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, 

the American Public Health Association, the Children's Defense 

Fund, and the United States Student Association. More
