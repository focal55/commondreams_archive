- May 23 - While protests mount over the lack of money allocated to

medicines for AIDS treatment, the dramatic growth of children orphaned by

AIDS threatens to become a global economic and security issue. Albina du

Boisrouvray, President and founder of the Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bagnoud

Association and Foundation, will brief media on the scope of the AIDS orphan

crisis and announce new initiatives to bring the issue before international

bodies, on Wednesday, May 30, 11:00 AM. She will also premier a powerful new

video on Nkosi Johnson, the South African youth who has become a voice of

AIDS orphans</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Du Boisrouvray, a leading expert on programs for children with AIDS and

passionate advocate for children's rights, will reveal the scope of this&quot;hidden problem&quot; which has been outside the AIDS discourse that revolves

around prevention and treatment.  She will outline FXB Association projects

that are already working in the field and announce new initiatives for

global action on the AIDS orphan crisis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We must reel these children back into society, into caring communities and

loving families to enable them to gain access to support, education, HIV

prevention, and health care so that these children can become the productive

citizens needed to lead their society into the future.&#148; said du Boisrouvray.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FXB Association will also present NKOSI: A VOICE OF AFRICA'S AIDS ORPHANS, a

film tribute to the life and work of the world's youngest AIDS advocate, Nkosi Johnson. The video, produced by Globalvision, features Nkosi's

groundbreaking speech before thousands in Durban, South Africa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">12-year-old Nkosi's potent advocacy for the tens of millions of other

AIDS-affected children in Southern Africa less fortunate than he, has put a

human face on the tragedy and brought attention to this under-examined

aspect of the AIDS crisis in Africa. It also features comments by Albina du

Boisrouvray and Nelson Mandela.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The screening and briefing will be held at the Institute for Policy Studies,

733 15th Street NW, Washington, DC.  For more information about the

Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Bagnoud Association and Foundation see <a href="http://www.fxb.org">www.fxb.org</a>. Its work

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Countess Albina du Boisrouvray, who recently was awarded France's Legion

of Honor for her innovative programs relating to children with AIDS, will be

available for interviews by contacting Karen Conner, 202-667-2342 or
