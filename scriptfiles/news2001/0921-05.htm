for Civil Rights Under Law ("Lawyers' Committee) joins with the

millions of Americans who are mourning the loss and devastation to

our nation from the violent and horrific attacks on the United

States. As we collectively grieve the loss of life we recognize

that the hate manifest on our nation knew no color, religion or

ethnicity -- it horrified and devastated everyone equally. It is

because of this reality that recent widespread incidents of hate

violence against racial and ethnic Americans, particularly those of

Middle Eastern descent are especially disturbing. Acts of hate

violence present a growing danger to American democracy and the

freedoms that all in our nation enjoy, the Lawyers' Committee

warned today.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Lawyers' Committee is grateful that such hateful acts have

been condemned by our political leaders both in the Administration

and Congress. To demonstrate our national solidarity in deploring

these violent crimes, the Lawyers' Committee is urging attendance

at next Tuesday's "Vigil for Community Healing, Tolerance, and

Unity" in Washington, D.C., because of fears that "misdirected

fury" will be a very real threat to our citizens and the unity of

the nation.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"With the past week's wave of violent hate crimes against

innocent Americans who even appear to be Middle Eastern, we are

undermining the very freedoms we're now battling to protect," said

Barbara R. Arnwine, Lawyers' Committee Executive Director.

"Incidents spreading from California to Cleveland are driven by

prejudice and stereotyping and instead of showing the unity and

strength in which our nation stands, represents a few committed to

hate and violence," Arnwine added.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arnwine emphasized that the hate crimes upsurge has been

horrific and senseless, even resulting in many incidents in the

past week against those not of Middle Eastern descent, including

Native Americans, African Americans as well as Sikhs who are not

Muslim, but a totally separate religion. Arnwine added "to make a

scapegoat of Sikhs is nonsensical, they are targeted merely because

they often wear turbans and beards -- highly visible symbols of

Middle Eastern origin."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The site of the Vigil is not by accident, its location at the

National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism reminds us that

we are a diverse nation and as such cannot cast blame on patriotic

Americans who by accident of birth share only an ancestry with

those who are suspected of attacking the United States. The

memorial is at the intersection of Louisiana Avenue, D Street, and

New Jersey Avenue, NW in Washington, DC. It is being sponsored by

the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and the Community

Relations Service of the Justice Department.
