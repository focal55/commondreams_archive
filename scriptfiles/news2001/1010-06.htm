- October 10  - &quot;Today Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) made history as the highest ranking woman in the U.S. Congress. Her election as Minority Whip shattered a long-standing Congressional glass ceiling,&quot; said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Kim Gandy. &quot;As Minority Whip, the NOW/PAC-endorsed Pelosi will garner support for legislation, count votes and continue her fierce advocacy for women's rights.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The election of a strong women's rights supporter to the number two leadership position in the Democratic Party signals a huge opportunity for women in politics as well as for our issues in Congress,&quot; Gandy continued. &quot;Rep. Pelosi's win lends courage and hope to other women's rights supporters who seek public office.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If minority leader Dick Gephart runs for President in 2004 and the Democrats win back the majority, Pelosi would be in line to become the first woman Speaker of the House.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As one of the House's strongest feminist leaders, Rep. Pelosi has advocated for women's issues across the board -- abortion rights, health care, economic justice, international human rights, lesbian and gay rights and stopping violence against women. And that's just mentioning a few,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;Rep. Pelosi was one of the ten courageous House women who demanded in a Senate Hearing that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) relinquish his hold on the passage of CEDAW (the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). Sen. Helms threw them out of the hearing, but they have continued their demands for justice.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW activists across the country are energized by this win,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;We plan to carry this energy through to the 2002 elections when the good ol' boys will lose their stronghold on Capitol Hill. Feminists are already preparing to elect reinforcements who will bring Congress back to its senses -- and our new Minority Whip will lead the way.&quot; </font></p>
