<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 21 - Thousands of American citizens are organizing in opposition to military

retaliation in response to the WTC and Pentagon attacks. &#147;While the

President, congress and much of the media are calling for war,&#148; said Kevin

Martin, Peace Action&#146;s Executive Director. &#147;many American citizens are

calling for an end to the cycle of violence. People from across the nation

are voicing opposition to the murder of innocent civilians inside and

outside of US borders.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peace Action chapters across the country, along with local peace groups,

have organized vigils, demonstrations and educational events that have drawn

crowds of thousands. Large crowds have gathered at peace vigils in New York,

New Jersey, Missouri, Maine, Oregon, and California.  Thousands more have

attended educational events such as those at the University of North

Carolina, North Carolina State University, and Goshen College.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to voicing a call for restraint, the actions have denounced

attacks on Muslims and Arab-Americans.  In New Hampshire an emergency

response network is being formed to respond to anti-Arab racism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Student Peace Action Network(SPAN), in association with local campus

organizations, held actions at 105 colleges throughout the nation yesterday.

SPAN has chapters on 42 college campuses and a presence on 80 more.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dozens of local actions are planned across the country in the next few days.

Vigils and teach-ins are planned in many states, including California, New

Jersey, New York, Illinois, North Carolina, Maine and Wisconsin.  Many other

locales are gearing up for events in the following weeks. Peace groups

around the nation are being flooded with calls and emails from concerned

citizens who want to get involved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Resorting to indiscriminate violence not only brings us to the level of the

terrorists, but it plays right into their hands,&#148; said Martin, &#147;such

violence will produce the fear and hatred in the terrorists&#146; homelands that

they need to prosper &#150; it enables them to bring ever more violence against

those they see as their enemy.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;People want justice, not vengeance.&#148; said Martin, &#147;The perpetrators of

these heinous crimes should be punished in the courts.  Military strikes

will take thousands of more innocent lives. A great nation does not punish

the innocent to assuage its anguish.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Peace Action is the nation&#146;s largest grassroots peace and disarmament

organization with 85,000 members nationwide. Peace Action, formerly

Sane/Freeze, organizes for the abolition of nuclear weapons, an end to the

international arms trade, an end to excessive Pentagon spending, and

peaceful resolution of violent conflicts.</i></font></p>
