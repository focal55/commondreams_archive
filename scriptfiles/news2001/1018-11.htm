Freedom to Trade? Trading Away American Family Farms</font></div>

- October 18 - As the  World Trade Organization (WTO) gets ready for its ministerial meeting to negotiate trade rules for agriculture, and while President Bush makes for a case for Trade Promotion Authority so he can find new  market opportunities for American farmers, a report released today by Food First/The Institute for Food and Development Policy, shows  that so-called free trade policies are virtually starving the American family farmer.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Department of Labor expects that the United States will lose 13.2 percent of all family farm jobs between 1998 and 2008, the largest projected job loss among all occupations. Driven by trade rules devised in Washington for the WTO, that strive to reduce or eliminate agricultural subsidies, a series of governmental policies are squeezing out the family farmer while benefiting corporate agribusiness.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#34;The disparity is a symptom of a support system that is out of kilter with the needs of the average cash-strapped farmer,&#34;says Anuradha Mittal, Food First Co-director and author of the report. &#34;Most payments are tied to acreage: more land equals bigger checks.&#34;

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is part of the &#34;get big or get out&#34; policy that drives farming in the United States and has accelerated corporate concentration in agriculture. Today only two companies, Cargill and Continental, control two-thirds of all grain trade in the world. Meanwhile, between 1994 and 1996 about 25 percent of all hog farmers, 10 percent of all grain farmers, and 10 percent of all dairy farmers went out of business.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#34;American family farmers have been the net losers because the prices they receive are below the cost of production. Family farmers produce too little to affect total supply and ultimately prices,&#34; Says Mittal. &#34;Reducing their output, rather than helping boost prices, means less revenue for them. So they have to keep boosting production to bring home even the smallest income.&#34;  The result is that family farmers work longer hours, produce more, and earn less -- far less.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The loss of family farms is wiping out rural communities across America. Family farm dollars once circulated through these communities, buying equipment, supplies, and groceries from local merchants. Larger corporate farms bypass this community network, in an effort to centralize their purchases. This has endangered the very existence of rural communities in America.

</font>

<p></p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report concludes that the excessive focus on exports is forcing overproduction and driving down farm prices. Low prices hurt American farmers, and make it impossible for farmers in other countries to compete.  Thus this model is driving both American family farmers, and their Third World counterparts from the land.  A more healthy alternative is a model that focuses on the strength of the family farm, which is relatively efficient, generates jobs, and can conserve the environment and preserve rural communities better than corporate farms.
