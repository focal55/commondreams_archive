- February 8 - Women and families may be

harmed by President Bush's tax cut if it passes in Congress,

according to the National Women's Law Center. The size of the tax

cut plan poses a serious threat to Social Security and Medicare and

other safety net programs and important services that women and

their families depend on. And, in contrast to the administration's

rhetoric, the distribution of the plan is not targeted to help

middle- and low-income families, but is unfairly tilted in favor of

high-income tax filers.

<p>"The President's plan uses up a sizable portion of the revenues

needed for programs in areas that are critical to women and their

families, such as Social Security, Medicare, education, child care

and health care. If the projected surpluses do not materialize, it

could mean cuts in these programs as well," said Nancy Duff

Campbell, NWLC co-president. Women have a greater stake in these

federal programs because they tend to earn less during their

lifetimes, live longer, and are more likely to bear the burden of

uncompensated family care-taking responsibilities.

<p>Campbell explained that the plan is unfairly tilted to provide

the greatest benefit to the highest-income filers. For example,

the plan to eliminate the estate tax would benefit primarily the

top five percent of tax filers and not the overwhelming majority of

women and their families who are not taxed on any inheritance. At

the same time, the plan provides nothing to the lowest-income

families, who are most in need of help in meeting their sizeable

federal payroll tax burden.

<p>Real tax relief should be modest in size, should be contingent

on surpluses materializing, and should focus most of its benefits

on helping middle- and low-income families. Specifically, women

and their families need:

<p>-- Modest rate reductions that target the greatest tax savings

to middle- and low-income families.

<p>-- An increased and refundable child tax credit that helps

families with children, especially the lowest-income families, meet

the substantial expenses of raising a child.

<p>-- An expanded and refundable child and dependent care tax

credit that helps middle- and low-income working families meet one

of the largest expenses in their family budgets - child care.

<p>-- Marriage penalty relief that is targeted to the two-income

couples who currently pay the penalty.

<p>-- Modifications to the earned income tax credit that help the

lowest-income working families whose basic living expenses consume

a disproportionate share of their budgets and whose marriage

penalties are among the highest.

<p>Campbell has over 30 years' experience in tax law and policy,

especially as it pertains to women and their families. She serves

on the board of the Community Tax Law Report and chaired the

national Coalition on Women and Taxes during the 1986 tax reform

debates.

<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-partisan, non-profit

organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and

protect women's legal rights. NWLC focuses on major policy areas

of importance to women and their families including economic

security, education, employment and health, with special attention

given to the concerns of low-income women. </i>
