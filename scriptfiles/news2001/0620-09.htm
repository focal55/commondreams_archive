- June 20 -  The Sierra Club reacted angrily today to news that

Secretary of Interior Gale Norton had proposed to withdraw a program that

would reintroduce grizzly bears into their natural habitat in Idaho and

Montana. The reintroduction program was established last year by the US

Fish and Wildlife Service to help the recovery of this endangered species.

<p>

"The Secretary of the Interior is continuing to make it clear that in her

vision for our public lands there is very little room for wildlife, but

ample space for oil wells," said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the

Sierra Club.  "This is yet another in a series of decisions which give

priority to the oil and timber industry, mining companies and polluters, at

the expense of wildlife, recreation, and the broader values of the American

people."

<p>

Today, there are fewer than 1,000 grizzlies, less than 1 percent of their

original population, in the lower 48 states. The plan involved introducing

five bears into more than 5700 acres of the Bitterroot Mountains in Idaho

and Montana each year for five consecutive years, starting in 2002.

Scientists anticipate that with this program the grizzly population would

have increased by 300 bears in one hundred years.

<p>

"We are extremely disappointed that the Bush Administration is dismantling

a program that aims to protect the grizzly bear species," Pope said. "This

is the time when we should conserve grizzly habitat and preserve the

species, not cater to the needs of oil and timber companies."

<p>

Timber cutting and road building displace bears and fragment their habitat.

It means reduced cover, reduced food sources and increased interaction with

humans.  Oil and gas development further jeopardizes the grizzly's future.

The web of pipelines, powerlines, roads and well pads makes habitat

unusable to grizzlies. Over 200 oil and gas wells have been drilled in the

Greater Yellowstone area and President Bush's energy plan urges more oil

wells to be built in the region.
