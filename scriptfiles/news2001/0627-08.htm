- June 27 - Today the Global AIDS 

Alliance (GAA), a broad coalition of debt cancellation advocates, 

AIDS treatment activists, faith-based organizations, human rights 

groups, and humanitarian agencies, in the United States and Africa, 

called the U.N.'s Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS &quot;an 

advancement in the fight for an expanded and comprehensive response 

to the epidemic.&quot; But the group questioned whether wealthy 

nations, particularly the United States, were prepared to back it 

up with action. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sadly, 2.5 million people will die this year from AIDS, and 

another 3 million may die next year, yet there is no sign of bold 

action emerging from this meeting,&quot; stated Co-Director Chatinkha 

Nkhoma, based in Malawi. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAA also called attention to the fact that while the U.N. 

meeting has heightened political pressure for concerted action, 

decisions on such key issues as the design and operation of the 

Global Fund are still being made behind closed doors among the 

wealthy donor nations, with little civil society input. &quot;To find 

where the real decisions are being made you should follow the 

money, and that leads you to the G7 governments, not to the U.N.,&quot; 

stated Dr. Paul Zeitz, co-director of the GAA. Zeitz is a public 

health specialist and medical doctor who designed AIDS response 

activities in Zambia. &quot;That reflects a domineering, colonialist 

pattern of behavior, not a real partnership with people in affected 

nations.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Is the U.S. really committed to the 'Declaration of 

Commitment'?&quot; asked Dr. Zeitz. &quot;President Bush should have been 

here personally and addressed the U.N. Assembly. In fact, the 

United States is already in clear violation of the declaration 

itself by opposing deeper debt relief, by not clearly supporting 

bulk procurement of medicines (including generics) on the basis of 

competitive bidding, and by proposing fiscal year 2002 spending on 

global AIDS that still falls far short of targets contained in the 

agreement being signed today.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">United States spending for fiscal year 2001 for all bilateral 

programs on global AIDS is only $439 million. Only about half of 

this is specifically for programs in Africa, where the impact of 

the epidemic is being most acutely felt. For fiscal year 2002 

President Bush has only proposed spending $446 million for 

bilateral programs, plus $200 million in proposed resources for the 

Global Fund, for a total of $646 million. Today, the House 

Appropriations Committee approved $415 million for bilateral global 

AIDS programs and $100 million for the global fund, in clear 

contradiction of the Declaration's goals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations and global experts estimate that at least 

$9.2 billion per year in grants are is needed. As the United States 

makes up 30 percent of the global economy, the U.S. fair share for 

this program should be $ 3 billion per year. According to a just 

released study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the 

share of the U.S. federal budget allocated to foreign aid has sunk 

to about one-half of 1 percent, a record low, and less than any 

other developed nation. This is far below the &quot;commitment&quot; the 

United States is signing today in the &quot;Declaration of Commitment.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the Declaration calls for effective and comprehensive debt 

relief, U.S. Ambassador Michael Southwick has stated in briefings 

at the United Nations that deeper debt relief is unnecessary in the 

context of HIV/AIDS because &quot;the HIPC program is a success.&quot; In 

fact, of the 23 countries that have received debt relief so far, in 

15 the annual debt servicing payments will still be higher than 

what the country is currently able to spend on basic health care. 

In total, debt service costs for the poorest nations will reach $2 

billion a year through 2005, in spite of the Heavily Indebted Poor 

Country Initiative (HIPC) debt relief program, if no further action 

is taken. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At least four nations made explicit appeals for deeper debt 

relief during the UNGASS, including Nigeria. On Monday, Sen. 

Hillary Rodham Clinton also called for broader relief and closer 

linkage of debt relief and the response to HIV/AIDS. &quot;During the 

three days of this meeting, 17 countries in Africa which have 

already passed the first stage of the debt relief process will have 

paid out $111 million in debt payments,&quot; stated Zeitz. &quot;Yearly they 

will still pay out over $1 billion in debt payments. This does not 

make good public health sense. We do not see debt relief as a magic 

bullet ands we never have. But the IMF and World Bank debt still 

must be cancelled and savings redirected to such useful purposes as 

fighting HIV/AIDS. We call on the G7 Finance Ministers, meeting in 

just a few weeks, to plan on dropping the debt at the G7 Summit in 

Genoa Italy on July 19, 2001.&quot;
