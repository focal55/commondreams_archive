<p>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT REACHES DANGEROUS CROSSROADS



<p>Accelerating ecological decline and loss of political momentum are bringing the

global environment to a dangerous crossroads, said the World watch Institute in

its new report, State of the World 2001. If these trends are not reversed, the

global environment and economy may suffer irreversible damage. 



<p>"Governments squandered the opportunity to reverse environmental decline during

the prosperity of the 1990s," said Christopher Flavin, President of the

Institute and co-author of the report.  "If in the current climate of political

and economic uncertainty, political leaders were to roll back environmental laws

or fail to complete key international agreements, decades of progress could

unravel."



<p>International climate talks broke down in December 2000, despite new scientific

evidence indicates that many global ecosystems are reaching dangerous

thresholds. The Arctic ice cap has already thinned by 42 percent, and 27 percent

of the world's coral reefs have been lost, suggesting that some of the planet's

key ecological systems are in decline. Environmental degradation is also

contributing to more severe natural disasters, which have cost the world $608

billion in the last decade-as much as in the previous four decades combined.



<p>Reversing threatening environmental trends is a daunting task, but the authors

of State of the World 2001 highlight a number of examples that show how people

are taking actions to pick a safer path to the future. An entire country,

Iceland, has launched a pioneering effort to replace fossil fuels used for its

cars and fishing boats with hydrogen, generated by the country's renewable

resources of hydropower and geothermal energy. Organic agriculture, which avoids

the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, has surged to a worldwide

annual market of $22 billion, and continues to grow rapidly. In December 2000,

negotiators from 122 countries agreed to a historic, legally binding treaty that

will severely restrict production of 12 toxic chemicals, including dieldrin,

aldrin, dioxins, and PCBs. 



<p>"With many life support systems at risk of long-term damage, the choice before

today's political leaders is historic, even evolutionary, in nature," said

Flavin. "Do we move forward rapidly to build a sustainable economy or do we risk

allowing the expansion in human numbers, the increase in greenhouse gas

emissions, and the loss of natural systems to destroy the very foundations of

the global economy?"
