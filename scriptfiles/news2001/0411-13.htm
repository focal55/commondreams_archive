- April 11 - President George W. Bush is continuing his assault on the

environment, using his budget proposal to muzzle the public's ability to

protect endangered species like the Florida black bear.  By preventing

Americans from getting help from federal courts to protect endangered

species and their habitats, President Bush gives Interior Secretary Gale

Norton full authority to determine the fate of whether threatened species

will go extinct.

<p>

"President Bush's actions would gut the Endangered Species Act, our

nation's premiere wildlife protection law," said Carl Pope, the Sierra

Club's Executive Director.  "President Bush's proposal would slam the

courthouse door on people working to save treasured animals like Florida's

black bear.  Americans don't want just one politician giving a thumbs-up or

thumbs-down on whether an animal vanishes from the planet.  To save the

jaguar, the coho salmon and hundreds of other species, Americans needed

independent courts to take politics out of the equation."

<p>

While the President's proposal would allow Americans to file suit to

protect wildlife, the federal government would not be allowed to spend a

dime on enforcing the decisions.  Citizen petitions to list endangered

species have been a critical tool in adding species to the endangered

species list and placing them on the road to recovery.  Courts have ordered

the Interior Department to protect a number of endangered animals and their

habitat, including the jaguar, the coho salmon in the Pacific Northwest,

and the California red-legged frog, which gained fame in Mark Twain's "The

Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."

<p>

If President Bush's policy prevails, other petitioned species awaiting

action, such as the Florida black bear, may never receive protection from

the Endangered Species Act.

<p>

The President's action puts Secretary Norton at odds with previous promises

to live by the letter of the Endangered Species Act.  That law specifically

allows Americans to use the courts to add animals to the Endangered Species

List if the Department of Interior fails to act.  The President's action

rejects the Act's vision for responsible stewardship.  In her Senate

confirmation hearing on Jan. 19, Norton testified: "The ESA, as I've said,

I do support the goals of that.  I also want to make clear that I will

apply that act as it is written and as the courts have interpreted it."

However, the proposed policy would cut the courts and the public out of the

process.

<p>

In addition, at her hearing, she said: "I will certainly uphold the

Endangered Species Act and the concept of preserving endangered species is

something that I view as very important.  It's one of the responsibilities

of the Department of Interior that I will vigorously pursue."
