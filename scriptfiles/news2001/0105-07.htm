- January 5 - An alliance of 17 leading nuclear non-proliferation 

  organizations commended retired General John Shalikashvili's on his 

  report to the President and Secretary, <I>Findings and Recommendations 

  Concerning the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</I> (CTBT), and urged the 

  President-elect and the Senate to use it as the starting point for rebuilding 

  a bipartisan consensus on nuclear testing and non-proliferation.

<P>"General Shalikashvili's report on the CTBT should 

  serve as the basis for a more balanced, less politicized dialogue on the CTBT and its 

  value to America's national security," said Daryl G. Kimball, director of the 

  Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers. "By itself, the CTBT cannot stop 

  proliferation, but the U.S. cannot effectively fight the spread of nuclear 

  weapons without it," said Kimball. "The new Senate and the new President owe 

  it to the nation to work together in a bipartisan fashion to undertake a more 

  thoughtful and balanced review of the CTBT," he added.</P>

  

  <P>"We are convinced that with careful study and a thorough exchange of 

  information, broader agreement can be forged on the CTBT so as to allow for 

  U.S. ratification. General Shalikashvili's report provides an excellent basis 

  for further deliberation on how to rebuild the bipartisan American consensus 

  on nuclear arms control and non-proliferation," said Thomas Graham, Jr., 

  President of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security</P>

  

  <P>In his letter to the President accompanying the report, which was released 

  today, General Shalikashvili said: "My discussions over the last ten months 

  have only strengthened my view that the Treaty is a very important part of 

  global non-proliferation efforts and is compatible with keeping a safe, 

  reliable U.S. nuclear deterrent."</P>

  

  <P>Shalikashvili found that "[t]he nation's nuclear arsenal is safe, reliable, 

  and able to meet all stated military requirements. For as far into the future 

  as we can see, the U.S. nuclear deterrent can remain effective under the Test 

  Ban Treaty...." He recommends that the next administration review, prioritize 

  and support the stockpile stewardship program to ensure that the U.S. nuclear 

  arsenal remains safe and reliable without further test explosions. He also 

  calls for sustained support for non-proliferation-related intelligence 

  resources, and an ongoing commitment to improving national and international 

  test monitoring capabilities, as well as test site transparency initiatives to 

  further increase confidence.</P>

  

  <P>"General Shalikashvili's report underscores the importance to U.S. security 

  of early ratification of the CTBT," said Spurgeon Keeny, President of the Arms 

  Control Association. "By outlawing nuclear tests, the CTBT will prevent the 

  development of new, more advanced weapons by nuclear states, and severely 

  constrain the nuclear weapons potential of countries that do not now have such 

  weapons," he added. "Experts agree that the U.S. does not need nuclear test 

  explosions to maintain its arsenal. So, it is clearly in the United States' 

  interest to ratify the Treaty to encourage others to do so and to implement 

  the Treaty's far-reaching verification provisions," Keeny argued.</P>

  

   <P>General Shalikashvili also said "...I have found broad bipartisan support 

  for strengthened U.S. leadership of a comprehensive international response to 

  the dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons. ... I hope that the 

  next Administration and the Senate will re-evaluate the Test Ban Treaty as 

  part of a bipartisan effort to forge an integrated non-proliferation strategy 

  for the new century." </P>

  

  <P>"President-elect Bush should recognize that there is broad-based support for 

  the CTBT," said John Isaacs, President of the Council for a Livable World. "Many 

  Democrats and Republican moderates agree with the view of Senators Chuck Hagel 

  (R-NE) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT) who have said&nbsp;' ... a clear majority of the 

  Senate, have not given up hope of finding common ground in our quest for a sound 

  and secure ban on nuclear testing.' " </P>

  

  <P>"The new President can ill-afford to ignore, let alone renounce, the United 

  States' decades-long commitment to the comprehensive test ban," noted 

  Isaacs.</P>

  

  <P>General Shalikashvili suggests that uncertainties about the CTBT can be 

  addressed by strengthening the "safeguards" to accompany the Treaty by 

  conducting a thorough review of the effect of the CTBT on U.S. security ten 

  years after ratification. Former Nixon Defense Secretary Melvin Laird, who 

  opposed the CTBT in 1999, has said that with such measures, "...my concern 

  over the indefinite ban on testing could largely be met. I would then agree 

  that being party to a CTBT, by preserving the qualitative advantage of our 

  nuclear arsenal and constraining the further development of advanced nuclear 

  weaponry, would be in the best interest of the United States."</P>

  

  <P>In his report, General Shalikashvili also cautions against attempts by the 

  U.S. to "renegotiate" the CTBT and failure to reconsider the Treaty. He 

  reports that: "A prolonged [test] moratorium would do less damage to U.S. 

  non-proliferation objectives ... than a resumption of testing, but most of the 

  benefits that the Test Ban Treaty can provide would be lessened or lost 

  without ratification."</P>

  

  <P>President-elect George W. Bush campaigned against ratification of the CTBT, 

  but he has stated his support for continuation of the U.S. nuclear test 

  moratorium in place since September 1992. Some of his cabinet appointees, like 

  General Colin Powell, are on record in support of the CTBT, others like 

  Secretary Donald Rumsfeld oppose it.</P>

  

  <P>"Putting partisan politics aside, the political ground truth is that 

  nuclear test explosions are no longer acceptable to the vast majority of 

  states, including all of America's closest allies," observed Christopher 

  Paine, a senior researcher with the Natural Resources Defense Council in 

  Washington, D.C. "The Bush Administration cannot reasonably expect to resume 

  nuclear testing unless it is also prepared to cripple or destroy the Nuclear 

  Non-Proliferation Treaty."</P>

  

  <P>"A hard-headed view of U.S. national security interests recognizes that a 

  U.S.-led return to nuclear testing would be a colossal security policy blunder 

  with unpredictable and potentially lethal consequences," Paine said. "While 

  the technical benefits of nuclear explosions are realistically no longer 

  available to the new Administration, the benefits from U.S. ratification and 

  entry-into-force of the CTBT are within reach. Our own security interests 

  dictate that President Bush should not allow the previous Senate's 

  thumb-in-the-eye of the international community to be America's last word on 

  the CTBT," he added.</P>

  

  

<P>The CTBT was negotiated with U.S. leadership and opened for signature in 

  1996. To date, the Treaty has been signed by 160 states, including 41 of the 

  44 states required for entry into force, and ratified by 69, including 30 of 

  the 44 required states. All NATO member states -- except the U.S. -- have 

  ratified the CTBT. In April 2000, the Russian Duma approved ratification of 

  the Treaty. In May 2000, the 180+ states gathered for the NPT Review 

  Conference expressed unanimous support for "... signatures and ratifications, 

  without delay and without conditions and in accordance with constitutional 

  processes, to achieve the early entry into force of the Comprehensive 

  Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty."</P>
