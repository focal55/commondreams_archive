- January 17 -  Today, in the final days of the current administration, the Food

and Drug Administration (FDA) submitted their long overdue,

controversial policy on genetically engineered foods. This is the

same policy that has come under fire from consumer, environmental

and farm groups since it was first proposed in May, 2000. The rules

will not require labeling of genetically engineered foods nor

require mandatory pre-market safety testing; the two provisions

food safety advocates have been lobbying for.

<p>"This policy means that the FDA will not require any mandatory

testing on genetically engineered food," said Andrew Kimbrell,

Executive Director of the Center for Food Safety and member of the

Genetically Engineered Food Alert coalition. "Under these rules,

American consumers will still be the guinea pigs testing the safety

of these foods. Voluntary labeling means consumers won't see any

labels out of this, and won't have a right to choose."

<p>The FDA has decided to move forward with their controversial and

criticized rules despite this fall's debacle and embarrassment in

the federal regulatory system over Starlink(tm) corn. StarLink(tm)

genetically engineered corn, which is not meant for human

consumption, was discovered by the Genetically Engineered Food

Alert in tacos shells and other corn products on grocery store

shelves. The Starlink(tm) debacle prompted over three hundred food

product recalls, causing millions of dollars in losses to food

processors, grain mills and farmers across the country.

<p>"With its new policy, the FDA is giving consumers a false sense

of security - the sense that the government is providing a

safeguard when this is really not the case," said Philip Clapp,

President of the National Environmental Trust. "This policy is

geared towards protecting industry, not consumers."

<p><b>Voluntary Labeling Means those Consumers will be deprived of the

Right to Choose

</b>

<p>The FDA's new policy also rejects mandatory labeling of

genetically engineered foods. Instead the agency has created a "GE

Free" voluntary labeling scheme which violates the right of

American consumers to know which foods have been genetically

engineered.

<p>"Under the new FDA policy not a single producer of genetically

engineered foods will have to reveal that their product is

genetically engineered," said Richard Caplan, Environmental

Advocate at the State Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs).

<p>FDA's new voluntary labeling idea would punish those not using

the technology by putting the burden on them to certify, test and

label their foods as "GE Free." Many companies will not want to

undergo the considerable time, expense and liability of testing,

certifying and labeling their foods as "GE Free."

<p>"FDA's new voluntary labeling policy serves the interests of a

few biotechnology companies at the expense of the rest of the food

industry and millions of consumers," said Caplan.

<p><b>Consultation Is Not Testing

</b>

<p>As part of the proposed guidelines, FDA announced today that it

will not require mandatory pre-market safety testing of genetically

engineered foods, but rather engage in "consultations" with food

producers. Consultations and safety reviews are still voluntary.

<p>"Mandatory consultations" have no legal meaning. To ensure

safety, the alteration of food involved in genetic engineering -

the addition of new genes, bacterial vectors, viral promoters, and

anti-biotic marker systems - should go through the rigorous safety

and toxicological tests required of all "food additives." Rules

should include new testing for such things as unknown allergens,

novel toxins and changes in nutritional content. To date, the FDA

has refused to require this food additive testing for genetically

engineered foods.

<p><b>US - EU Panel Calls for Mandatory Labeling of Genetically

Engineered Food

</b>

<p>FDA's policy ignores the recommendations of the Biotechnology

Consultative Forum, and international panel of experts,

representing both sides of the biotechnology argument.

<p>In a report released on December 18, 2000, the Biotechnology

Consultative Forum, recommended to the Clinton Administration that

genetically engineered food be more strictly regulated in the

United States. The panel called for mandatory labeling of

genetically engineered food in order to protect consumers' right to

informed choice about what they eat.

<p><b>American Consumers Overwhelmingly Support Labeling GE Foods

</b>

<p>Most Americans support labeling. A Harris Poll conducted this

summer showed that 86 percent of Americans believe the government

"should require the labeling of all packaged and other food

products stating they include corn, soy or other products which

have come from genetically modified crops."

<p><b>Petition for Real Safety Rules Ignored by FDA

</b>

<p>On March 21, 2000, the Center for Food Safety and 50 other

environmental and consumer safety groups filed a legal petition

with the FDA demanding the development of a thorough pre-market and

environmental testing regime and mandatory labeling for genetically

engineered foods. The petition provided FDA with a blueprint for

developing a mandatory pre-market safety regime based upon the

legal requirements of the Food Additive petition process.

<p>The petition specifies what steps must be taken to ensure public

confidence in the FDA's authority over genetically engineered

foods, including specific tests for allergenicity, toxicity, and

unintended effects, and institution of mandatory labeling for

genetically engineered foods.

<p><b>About GE Food Alert and GEFoodAlert.Org

</b>

<p>Genetically Engineered Food Alert founding members include:

Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for

Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic

Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and

the State Public Interest Research Groups.

<p>Genetically Engineered Food Alert believes that genetically

engineered food or food ingredients should not be allowed on the

market until they are adequately safety tested and labeled. The

campaign provides web-based opportunities for individuals to

express concern about genetically engineered food and fact sheets

on health, environmental and economic information about genetically

engineered food. The campaign is endorsed by more than 250

scientists, religious leaders, doctors, chefs, environmental and

health leaders, as well as farm groups.
