- July 17 - Responding to a rash of 

missed clean air deadlines, Earthjustice today filed the second of 

seven lawsuits challenging the federal government's chronic failure 

to protect Americans from the health hazards of toxic air 

pollution. Earthjustice represents Sierra Club in its second suit 

this week against the Environmental Protection Agency. To compel 

EPA to do its job, Earthjustice is filing one lawsuit each day for 

a week. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All seven lawsuits address EPA's repeated failure to establish 

controls for highly toxic air pollutants such as dioxins, PCBs, and 

mercury pollutants that can cause devastating health effects even 

in tiny doses. Today's lawsuit challenges EPA's failure to 

implement a key requirement in the Clean Air Act: the Act's mandate 

to reduce emissions of the hazardous air pollutants that are the 

greatest threat to public health in urban areas. These pollution 

sources include chemical plants and various types of waste 

incinerators, among others, but the list is incomplete and most of 

the sources remain unregulated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Clean Air Act's provisions for hazardous air pollution 

focus primarily on 'major sources,' that emit very large amounts of 

pollution each year,&quot; said James Pew, an attorney with 

Earthjustice. &quot;But Congress also recognized that hazardous 

emissions from smaller sources can significantly threaten public 

health, especially in towns and cities where such sources may be 

numerous and concentrated. So Congress required EPA to identify the 

categories of smaller sources that most threaten public health in 

urban areas and to ensure that those categories are subject to the 

same strict standards as the larger sources.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Clean Air Act, EPA was required to identify the 

relevant categories of smaller pollution sources by November 15, 

1995, and to promulgate regulations for them by November 15, 2000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Almost six years after the statutory deadline, EPA still hasn't 

even identified all the categories required,&quot; points out Dr. Bob 

Palzer, chair of Sierra Club's Air Committee. &quot;And of the 29 

categories that EPA has identified, the agency has left 20 

uncontrolled.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;EPA's failure to do its job is putting people at risk, 

especially people living in the more industrialized parts of cities 

and towns,&quot; said Marti Sinclair, chair of Sierra Club's 

Environmental Quality Committee. &quot;The risk of disease from these 

highly toxic pollutants is a risk that Congress wanted EPA to 

eliminate. Essentially the administration is reneging on Congress's 

promise.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of Sierra Club, Earthjustice filed suit in the United 

States District Court for the District of Columbia. </font></p>
