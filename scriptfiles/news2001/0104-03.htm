- January 4 - The Black Leadership

Forum, Inc. (BLF), announces that BLF and the extended black

leadership family will focus their near term attention on several

policy priorities of great importance to the African American

community, notably:

<p>-- Voting rights and attendant litigation;

<br>-- Management of Year-2000 U.S. census data;

<br>

-- Appropriate personnel to guarantee fair administration of

justice and public education policies; and

<br>

-- Equitable decisions regarding economic initiatives such as

interest rates and tax cuts.

<p>Oversight of transition activities of in-coming President George

W. Bush's administration and evaluations of nominees to cabinet

positions which have serious implications for maintenance of civil

rights gains and the African American quality of life, are also

central elements of BLF's agenda.

<p>An immediate priority of BLF and its extended family will be a

convocation of leadership in Tallahassee, Fla., on Jan. 20, 2001 to

continue the redress of voting rights' abuses and to celebrate

black voter participation during the November 2000 election.

<p>Leading a Jan. 2 press briefing on policy priorities and other

initiatives during the coming month, BLF's chairman Dr. Joseph E.

Lowery and Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr., president, Rainbow/PUSH

Coalition, announced that the Tallahassee celebration will be a

joint venture of national leaders including the AFL/CIO, other

national labor organizations and BLF-member organizations and their

affiliates.

<p>"Regarding our OEConvocation on the Democratic Process in

Tallahassee, we shall assemble because our immediate focus is on

Florida where the integrity of the vote is in question. Our

assembly, however, will challenge the entire nation to honor voting

rights -- in all elections in this country -- which are guaranteed

by Article II and the 15th, 22nd and 26th amendments of the U.S.

Constitution, concerning race, sex and age, as Federally protected

rights of all of the people," stated Lowery.

<p>Leaders also expressing support for the BLF Priority Agenda and

the Tallahassee event include Dr. Dorothy I. Height, President

Emerita, National Council of Negro Women; Congressman John Conyers

(D-MI); Bill Lucy, President, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists;

Melanie Campbell, Executive Director, Operation BIG VOTE; Kweisi

Mfume, president and CEO, NAACP; John Sweeney, president, AFL/CIO;

leadership of the National Urban League; Dr. Yvonne

Scruggs-Leftwich, BLF's Executive Director and others.
