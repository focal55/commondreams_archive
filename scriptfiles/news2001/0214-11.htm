- February 14 - According to official internal reports, about one-third of the Mexican meat

slaughtering and processing plants inspected by the United States Department of Agriculture

(USDA) were so ill-equipped, dirty, or otherwise in violation of USDA safety rules that they were

barred from exporting to the U.S.  However, senior USDA officials rejected the recommendation

of USDA&#146;s inspectors to immediately audit &#147;Mexico&#146;s entire meat inspection system.&#148;



<P>&#147;President Bush should urge President Fox to improve Mexico&#146;s meat inspection system to 

assure consumers that the safety of their food is not being sacrificed on the altar of international

trade,&#148; said Benjamin Cohen, Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) Senior Staff

Attorney.



<P>Of 37 Mexican plants authorized to export to the U.S., ten were inspected by the USDA in

the spring of 1999.  Because USDA found serious deficiencies, it inspected 15 additional plants

that November.  Eight of those 25 plants &#151; 32 percent &#151; flunked USDA&#146;s inspections because of

such violations as fecal contamination, not having hand soap at the workers&#146; hand-washing

facilities, meat being stored under insanitary conditions, failure to sanitize contaminated

equipment, and failure to conduct bacteria tests on a random basis.  The USDA inspectors also

found serious deficiencies in the Mexican laboratories that are supposed to test the meat for deadly

<EM>Salmonella</EM> bacteria.



<P>The USDA inspectors also said that prior to the second audit the Mexican government

had assured the USDA that it had corrected the problems revealed by the first audit.  However,

the second set of USDA inspectors concluded that, in fact, Mexico had failed to correct three of

the six major deficiencies in its inspection system.



<P>The USDA audit team &#147;strongly&#148; recommended that a &#147;follow-up audit of Mexico&#146;s

entire meat inspection system be organized and carried out, within three months, to ensure that

these serious issues are being satisfactorily resolved.&#148;



<P>But instead of conducting an audit, the USDA again accepted the Mexican government&#146;s

assurances that the problems had been corrected.  USDA announced on December 14, 1999, that

it had decided that Mexico has a meat-inspection system that is &#147;equivalent&#148; to USDA&#146;s

standards for domestic plants.  Had USDA concluded that the Mexican system was not

&#147;equivalent&#148; to ours, Mexico could not export meat to the United States.



<P>In letters sent to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, CSPI urged Congress

to order the USDA either to audit all the plants in a particular country or to stop imports from the

unaudited plants when its audits reveal a significant proportion of unsafe meat and poultry plants.



<P>In fiscal year 1999 the United States imported 11 million pounds of meat from Mexico.
