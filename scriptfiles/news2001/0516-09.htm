- May 16 - Congressional hearings are being held today on President Bush's nomination of Wade Horn, the founder of the Fatherhood Initiative, to become Assistant Secretary for Family

Support at the Department of Health and Human Services. On Friday, the National

Council of Women's Organizations will hold a briefing on "welfare

reform" reauthorization. The following analysts are available for

interviews:

Policy attorney with the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, Payne said today: “Horn advocates denying single-parent families access to important public benefits whose supply

is limited -- such as Head Start, subsidized housing, school loans and grants, and

job training -- unless there are leftovers after all two-parent families have

been served.... Horn advocates denying welfare benefits to two-parent families if

the parents are not married.... He asserts that women are almost as likely as men

to commit domestic violence.”

Professor of politics at the University of California at Santa Cruz and author of

<I>Welfare's End</I>, Mink, who will speak at the Friday briefing, said

today: "Poor mothers are being forced into low wage and contingent jobs in

a labor market that is hugely stratified by a racialized gender wage gap....

Despite this, conservatives like Wade Horn insist that poor mothers are poor

because they are not married -- and that the 'next step' in welfare reform

therefore must be to promote marriage and fatherhood. Most of the

fatherhood/marriage initiatives that are floating around discriminate against

mothers, offering employment and training to non-custodial fathers so that they

can be better 'breadwinners'.... Horn reflects the heavy-handed, Big Brother

conservatism of the Bush administration.... The idea is not only that fathers

should get all sorts of rights and 'carrots' while mothers get all sorts of

discipline and 'sticks'; it also is that single mothers must forfeit the rights

to make intimate decisions that the rest of us hold dear because they are poor

and unmarried. As Assistant Secretary of HHS, Wade Horn would play a critical

role in the reauthorization of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. His

confirmation would be a blow to poor mothers' rights under TANF and to poor

mothers' equal citizenship."

Delgado is director of the Applied Research Center, which recently released a report titled

"Cruel and Usual: How Welfare 'Reform' Punishes Poor People." Among

the report's findings: "Welfare reform has more than halved the welfare

rolls, but it has done little to lift people out of poverty.... Devolution, the

new version of 'states' rights,' has greatly exacerbated the arbitrariness of

the welfare system.... There is tremendous variation from state to state in the

way people are treated when they seek assistance, and the kind of assistance,

if any, they receive."
