- May 1 -  Carrying an inflatable missile, a  large banner reading "Stop Star Wars" and sounding an air  siren, several activists from Greenpeace and other  environmental groups protested outside of National Defense  University today, where President Bush was giving a  speech promoting a missile defense shield. Although Bush  talked of reducing nuclear weapons, he then laid the  groundwork for breaking the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in  order to build a national missile defense system. Calling  Bush "The Treaty Breaking Toxic Texan", Greenpeace says  that today’s protest is part of its intensive campaign to  safeguard the planet against Bush’s attempt to re-ignite a  nuclear arms race.

<p>According to a senior administration official, the President  spent much of yesterday calling leaders of several major  European allies to discuss today’s speech. After world wide  criticism over his abandonment of the global warming  treaty, Bush spent the day trying to clean up his "treaty  breaking" image. According to a senior administration  official, the President called leaders of several major  European and Asian allies to discuss today’s speech. </p> 



<p>In a statement released yesterday, Greenpeace called  Bush’s plan to reduce nuclear weapons, "a publicity driven  sleight of hand designed to rip up the Anti-Ballistic Missile  (ABM) Treaty while pushing the National Missile Defense  down the collective throats of the world." The international  environmental group further stated, "Although Bush would  like the American public to believe that his defense plan is  designed to protect the country from so-called rogue  countries such as Iran and Iraq, the United States is the true  rogue country in trying to re-ignite a nuclear arms race." </p>



<p>While Bush has announced proposed reductions in the  number of nuclear weapons, mainly from stock that is  outdated and useless, he is proposing an increase in the  budget of $5.3 billion for the design, development and  production of nuclear weapons. In addition, Bush has  proposed a 20% cut for the Department of Energy’s Office  of Defense and Nuclear Non-Proliferation, which works to  prevent the spread of materials, technology and expertise  relating to weapons of mass destruction. </p> 



<p>Immediately following Bush’s speech, Greenpeace  Executive Director John Passacantando, Greenpeace  Nuclear Disarmament Coordinator Gordon Clark, M.I.T.  professor, Ted Postol and U.S. Representative Dennis J.  Kucinich, (D-OH), held a telephone press conference  denouncing President Bush’s missile defense system and  its danger to world security and peace.
