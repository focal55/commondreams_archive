- April 9 - Felony charges were thrown out today for four more

Republican National Convention (RNC) protest defendants on trial before

Common Please Court Judge Pamela Dembe. William Beckler of Barrington, NJ

and Daniel Kruk of Philadelphia were acquitted of all charges.  Shane

Bastien of Helena, Montana and Andrew Hess of Philadelphia were also

acquitted of felony charges and convicted of summary disorderly conduct,

equivalent to a jay walking ticket.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Originally all four defendants had a variety of felony charges, including

aggravated assault, but by the time of trial each had the same charge of

felony riot and misdemeanor disorderly conduct.  During the one-day bench

trial, each defendant was represented by their own legal counsel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Police lieutenant William Schmidt and police officer Mark Anthony testified

on behalf of the prosecution.  In direct examination, Schmidt explained

that while heading the bike patrol on August 1st, the day of mass arrests,

he &#147;herded&#148; people away from a death penalty rally at City Hall southward.

Schmidt and Anthony said they were confronted with a large group of

protesters who were headed toward Rittenhouse Square.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schmidt and Anthony both convey a story of how they were assaulted by each

of the defendants.  One person allegedly charged Anthony.  One person

apparently wrestled with Anthony attempting to free a defendant he was

arresting.  Another person supposedly ran at Schmidt with an unlit firework

called a &#147;roman candle.&#148;  Yet another person was reported to have thrown

objects, possibly rocks, at the two officers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schmidt and Anthony&#146;s stories lacked credibility when they were unable to

produce any evidence supporting their claims.  Schmidt apparently threw

away the &#147;roman candle.&#148;  No rocks or any other objects were ever retrieved

in order to substantiate that aspect of their story.  Schmidt&#146;s and

Anthony&#146;s other claims of assault not only failed to hold up months ago in

pre-trial hearings, where multiple felony charges were dropped against the

defendants, but apparently did not manage to convince Judge Dembe either.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether true or not, the story of the two Philadelphia police officers did

not hold water with Dembe.  Despite their coordinated testimony, Schmidt

and Anthony were unable to convince Dembe that the defendants deserved

anything more than a summary offense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beckler was on the streets on August 1 during the RNC protests as a legal

observer, making sure that activists&#146; civil rights were not being violated.

 While watching the arrest of others, Beckler was scooped up by police and

slapped with aggravated assault and other charges.  Beckler is a recent

graduate of Columbia Law School and was in Philadelphia last summer to

volunteer with R2K Legal, the support group set up to assist activists in

their legal rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I have been unable to fully engage in my normal activist work for over

eight months now while having this trial hanging over my head,&#148; says ex-RNC

defendant Beckler.  &#147;I am relieved that I can get on with my life.  The

upshot I suppose is that my experience lends credence to the need to

overhaul the dysfunctional criminal justice system.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are currently five more felony defendants awaiting trial.  Two felony

trials should occur in July.  The three felony defendants accused of being

involved in a scuffle with Philadelphia police commissioner John Timoney

are awaiting a ruling on an appeal by the District Attorney.  The DA&#146;s

office was displeased when late last year, the three had numerous felonies

thrown out in a pre-trial hearing.  The appeal lengthens their prosecution

considerably, having to wait at least a year before trial is likely to occur.
