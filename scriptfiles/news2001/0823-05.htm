<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 22 - The Violence Policy 

Center (VPC) has joined Montgomery County, Md., Maryland Attorney 

General Joseph Curran, and Marylanders Against Handgun Abuse 

(MAHA), to support the County's decision to stop subsidizing gun 

sales at gun shows with public funds. Joined by MAHA, the VPC filed 

a friend-of-the-court brief in federal district court in Baltimore, 

in support of the County's new ordinance. Passed by the County 

Council on May 16, 2001, and signed into law on May 29, 2001, the 

ordinance prohibits facilities that host gun shows at which guns 

are sold from receiving public funding. The Montgomery County 

Agricultural Center, site of the County fair, is one such facility, 

and gun show promoter Frank Krasner sued to stop the County gun 

show law from going into effect. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Drawing upon the VPC's pioneering study, Gun Shows in America 

Tupperware(r) Parties for Criminals, which brought national 

attention to the gun show phenomenon, the VPC/MAHA brief outlines 

the facts about gun shows, which too often provide a convenient 

location for criminals, children, and gun traffickers to get guns. 

In 2000, there were more than 4,000 gun shows in the United States 

and 21 gun shows in Maryland. At the Montgomery County gun shows, 

for example, certain types of 50 caliber sniper rifles, which can 

shoot down helicopters, and certain types of assault weapons can be 

sold without Brady background checks by unlicensed sellers to 

anyone, no questions asked. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Montgomery County should ensure that the public's hard-earned 

dollars are not used to pay for gun shows where guns are sold,&quot; 

said Mathew Nosanchuk, VPC litigation director and legislative 

counsel. &quot;All too often, gun shows provide a convenient means for 

felons, fugitives, and children to get guns. There is no reason 

that County residents should be forced to subsidize this kind of 

potentially dangerous activity in their own backyards.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the friend-of-the-court brief filed today, the VPC soundly 

refutes the plaintiffs' claim that a restriction on County funding 

for gun shows where guns are sold somehow violates the First 

Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Said Nosanchuk, &quot;selling guns 

at gun shows is not political speech, it's not protected commercial 

speech, and it's certainly not protected assembly. It's selling 

guns, and the County has every right to stop paying for it directly 

or indirectly.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The VPC and MAHA are represented in this case by Wilmer, Cutler 

&amp; Pickering in Washington, D.C. Attorneys Randolph Moss, Stuart 

Delery, David Molot, Rachael Hill, and Laura Fein prepared the 

brief. </font></p>
