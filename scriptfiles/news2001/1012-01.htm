- October 12 - Sarah Brady, chair of the 

Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, today issued the following 

statement regarding the U.S. Senate's passage last night of 

anti-terrorism legislation. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With passage of this legislation, the Senate has taken a 

significant step toward ensuring that law enforcement has the tools 

needed to investigate and deter terrorist attacks. But there is 

one glaring omission - nothing in this bill will close the gaps in 

our federal firearm laws that allow terrorists to amass their 

deadly arsenals. The House should address this failure when it 

takes up the legislation today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We know from recent terrorism investigations that these 

dangerous criminals will exploit any opening in our laws to buy 

weapons, including firearms. In some cases, they have gone to gun 

shows and bought firearms and ammunition from unlicensed sellers 

who were not required to conduct criminal background checks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Incredibly, our soldiers could be gunned down by foreign 

terrorists armed with firearms purchased at American gun shows. We 

can, and must, close loopholes in our firearm laws by requiring a 

background check every time a firearm is sold. A criminal 

background check is a minor inconvenience for gun buyers -- most 

are completed within minutes -- but is a key tool for protecting 

public safety. We must also ensure that there are records of all 

firearm sales so that law enforcement officials can track 

terrorists, trace their weapons, and know what threats they are 

facing when they attempt to apprehend these criminals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Any anti-terrorism proposal that fails to address easy access 

to firearms and retention of records is clearly inadequate. If we 

need more careful screening of people entering our country, surely 

we need to check the background of people buying guns once they are 

here. And it makes no sense to crack down on terrorists laundering 

money, if we allow them to use their cash to buy weapons with 

impunity. The Congress and the Administration should work together 

to make this counter-terrorism package more comprehensive.&quot; </font></p>
