- June 26 - After a meeting Monday morning of its Emergency Response Team, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) has earmarked $15,000 to launch a crisis fund for relief efforts in Peru. This weekend, an earthquake that is reported to have registered between 7.9 and 8.1 on the Richter Scale, devastated communities in Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna. There are unconfirmed reports of damage in Huancavelica and other areas. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This initial grant from the AFSC Emergency and Material Assistance Program (EMAP) Crisis Fund will seed immediate relief efforts and detailed needs assessment by staff and partners in the region. Funds could go directly to purchase supplies and medicines, blankets, food or any materials which are of critical need in affected areas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Poverty in the region makes the situation more critical,&quot; states Carlos Mejia, director of the AFSC Emergency and Material Assistance Program. &quot;People need us and contributions are critical. It is now winter in Peru, and many people live in adobe homes with no heating systems and will have difficulty coping with the cold.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC has been working in Latin America and the Caribbean for more than 60 years. The Quaker International Affairs Program in the Andean region began in 1995 to strengthen peace efforts by building bridges across social, political, ethnic, economic, and gender barriers. Program work is carried out in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela and in Panama in relation to the border it shares with Colombia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Staff in the region is working to gain vital information from rural areas,&quot; states Barbara Smith associate regional director for the AFSC Latin American and Caribbean Program. &quot;At this time we are in contact with Friends in Puno who are gathering information from Tacna and Arequipa. We are still trying to reach youth with whom we work who were in Arequipa at the time of the earthquake,&quot; Smith went on to state. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contributions may be directed to AFSC and marked &quot;Peru Earthquake Fund&quot; and mailed to AFSC Development, 1501 Cherry Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102.
