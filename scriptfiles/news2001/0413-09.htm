- April 13 - As world leaders prepare to gather in Quebec City for the Summit

of the Americas April 20-22, WWF is urging the 34 heads of state to

ensure protection of the environment in all trade negotiations,

specifically those related to the Free Trade Area of the Americas

(FTAA).

<p>The meeting will be U.S. President George W. Bush's first foreign

policy meeting and will likely be dominated by massive protests from

a variety of organizations. WWF will have a team of trade and

sustainable development experts available from throughout the

Americas to analyze the issues.

<p>Prior to the Summit, WWF will be:

<p>-- Issuing a statement April 16 outlining demands for including

conservation and environmental considerations in FTAA negotiations;

<p>-- Launching a new book April 17 (co-authored by Winnipeg-based

International Institute for Sustainable Development) on how NAFTA's

investment chapter is harming conservation and sustainable

development. The book focuses on the growing list of international

legal claims under NAFTA brought by multinational corporations

opposed to environmental regulations;

<p>-- Spearheading a petition to be released April 18 by scores of

non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the hemisphere calling

on heads of state to endorse "sustainability assessments" of the FTAA

-- that is, to conduct official reviews of the FTAA's potential

impacts on conservation &amp; sustainable development;

<p>-- Participating in a major international symposium, "Hemispheric

Trade and Sustainability," April 17-19 in addition to other NGO

events such as the "People's Summit"
