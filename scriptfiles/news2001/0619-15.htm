- June 19 - The following is a 

statement by Matthew L. Myers, president, Campaign For Tobacco-Free 

Kids: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Caught in its first effort to kill the federal tobacco lawsuit 

by denying the necessary funding, the Bush Administration is now 

reported to be seeking to settle the case. The American people 

should be concerned that the administration is seeking yet another 

way to let the tobacco industry off the hook for decades of 

deception and wrongdoing. It is especially worrisome that 

administration officials are weakening the hand of their 

negotiating team by stating ahead of time that they believe they 

would lose in court. No attorney representing a client in good 

faith prepares for trial by saying they expect to lose, and this 

statement is a tremendous disservice to the government's client -- 

the American people. It is also an inaccurate appraisal of the 

government's case given the extensive and powerful evidence of 

industry wrongdoing. The administration's approach gives every

indication that the settlement is intended to be a sweetheart deal 

for the tobacco industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is clearly a political decision, not a legal judgment. The 

tobacco industry made more than $8.3 million in campaign 

contributions during the last election, 83 percent of it to 

Republicans. Killing the federal tobacco lawsuit is one of the 

industry's top priorities. In contrast, thousands of Americans 

have contacted the White House in recent weeks with a message that 

they want their day in court and an end to special protection for 

Big Tobacco. It speaks volumes about the political influence of 

the tobacco industry that its campaign contributions appear to be 

drowning out the voices of the American people. </font></p>
