- April 18 - The Sierra Club today sharply criticized the

BushAdministration for rejecting decades of scientific study on the dangers

of drinking arsenic and reopening the discussion about how much

cancer-causing poison Americans should drink.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By ignoring decades of study and considering doubling the amount of

arsenic allowed in our water, President Bush is making an unsafe,

irresponsible decision that pleases the mining industry at our families'

expense,&quot; said Carl Pope, the Sierra Club's Executive Director.  &quot;If

President Bush hadn't caved to the mining industry, we would be on the road

to protecting Americans at the standard recommended by the U.S. Public

Health Service in 1962.  But instead, President Bush's proposal could

double Americans'cancer risk from arsenic in their drinking water.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It couldn't be more simple -- Americans don't want their families drinking

arsenic, but under President Bush's proposal, Americans could drink twice

as much arsenic as the World Health Organization recommends for third-world

countries,&quot; Pope continued.  &quot;There's no new news in this and no good news

in this.  President Bush is demanding more delay, continued consideration

of unsafe arsenic levels in our drinking water, and more

scientific study of an issue that's been exhaustively examined for decades.

This leaves communities and everyone concerned about safe drinking water

uncertain about whether their water will be safe enough to drink when

President Bush is finally done.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before the Clinton EPA strengthened drinking water standards, those levels

were set at 50 parts per billion (ppb), based on 1942 data.  Then, in

January, the EPA lowered allowable levels to 10 ppb, at which level the

cancer risk is one additional cancer case for every 500 people.  But at 20

ppb -- the upper level being considered by the Bush Administration -- the

cancer risk increases to 1 per 250 people.  (The Safe Drinking

Water Act usually only allows cancer risks of one case per 10,000 people.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the National Academy of Sciences, long-term exposure to low

concentrations of arsenic in drinking water can lead to skin, bladder, lung

and prostate cancer. Non-cancer effects of ingesting arsenic at low levels

include cardiovascular disease diabetes, and anemia, as well as

reproductive, developmental, immunological and neurological effects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When U.S. EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman served as New Jersey's

Governor, the state's Department of Environmental Protection recommended

that homeowners whose water supply contained arsenic at half the level set

by the Clinton Administration take steps to reduce their exposure to the

poison.  (&quot;DEP Urges Testing for Arsenic in Wells; Wants N.J. to Meet

Proposed EPA Standard,&quot; Bergen Record, June 3, 2000)</font></p>

<b>1942</b> -- Public Health Service (PHS) conducts arsenic study.  This is the

debate, millions of dollars in EPA research, and at least three missed

the EPA finally issued the new 10 parts per billion standard, matching the

level set previously by the World Health Organization and the level
