Garcia is a policy advocate for the San Diego-based Environmental Health Coalition, one of the oldest grassroots environmental and social justice organizations in the United

States. She said today: "While the evidence is clear that NAFTA has failed

to protect the environment, the president is promoting it as a model for the

Free Trade Area of the Americas. Fast track would allow Bush to negotiate the FTAA

without being hampered by public input. It was fast-track authority that

allowed the closed-door negotiation of NAFTA with Canadian, U.S. and Mexican

trade officials and multinational corporations -- with no input from

environmental or labor interests. The results have been very negative for the

environment, especially here at ground zero of NAFTA. For example, the Alamar

River in Mexico is rank with raw sewage and industrial wastewater -- a

byproduct of U.S. and foreign-owned maquiladoras operating in Mexico under

NAFTA."

Mendonca (who can be interviewed in English) is the director of the Social Network for Justice and Human Rights in Brazil. She said today: "If Congress approves fast-track

authority, it will be giving a blank check to big business to carry out

policies that will be very detrimental to the people of the Americas. The FTAA

will mean that large corporations will benefit while the public's right to

health, education, food, job security, living wages and environmental safety

will be further threatened. It will also increase Latin America's vulnerability

to whims of speculative capital."

Hansen-Kuhn is the international coordinator of the Alliance for Responsible Trade. She said

today: "The current debate on fast-track authority has been marred by

accusations that are either inflammatory, irrelevant or both. A recent example

is U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick's assertion that those opposing

the administration's request for that authority are 'xenophobes and

isolationists.' In fact, opposition to this model of corporate-led

globalization is both global in scale and internationalist in perspective. Tens

of thousands of people from Buenos Aires to Quebec have taken this message to

the streets, to city councils and national legislatures to demand a very

different kind of economic integration. The real issue is who wins and who

loses under the resulting accords. People throughout the Americas understand

that it is not countries that benefit or suffer from these policies but rather

specific sectors within each nation. Workers, environmentalists, family

farmers, women and many others in the U.S. have joined forces with their counterparts

in other countries to advance a common agenda..."

Juhasz is a project director for the International Forum on Globalization, which represents over 60 organizations in 25 countries. She said today: "The administration wants

fast-track authority in order to speed through agreements such as the proposed

FTAA that would extend NAFTA to the entire Southern Hemisphere and to further

the agenda of the November meeting of the WTO -- the first ministerial-level

meeting since the collapse of talks in Seattle. Fast track is a mechanism by

which many of the key democratic processes used to create legislation are

eliminated -- these include the full committee process, full debate and the

ability to amend legislation. The full democratic process is critical when

addressing issues about which there is so much controversy and

disagreement."
