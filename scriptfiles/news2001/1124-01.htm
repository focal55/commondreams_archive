- November 24 - Amber Amundson, whose husband Craig was killed in the attack on 

the Pentagon, wrote shortly after the attack, &#147;I call on our national leaders 

to find the courage to break the cycle of violence.&#148; Sentiments like these 

have come from others who lost spouses, children, brothers or sisters. This week 

some of these mourners are going beyond words, joining a walk that will link the 

two cities that were struck. Their message to all they meet as they walk or assemble 

along the way: Our grief is not a cry for war.</font> 

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The group of survivors 

and friends will set off at 9 AM Sunday, November 25, from the front gates of 

Georgetown University in Washington, DC (37th and O Street). They will arrive 

the next Sunday, December 2, in New York City. In between they will walk some 

distances and shuttle others, stopping in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Paterson and 

other locations to take parts in events being organized by local churches and 

other groups. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Craig Amundson&#146;s brother, 

Ryan, will also join the walk. He states, &#147;We don&#146;t want to see more 

widowed mothers like my sister-in-law, more little kids without a dad like my 

niece and nephew, more moms and dads outliving their son like my parents, or more 

brothers losing brothers like me. The current reliance on military force does 

not confront the political, social, and economic foundations of terrorism. By 

emphasizing a military solution, the United States will not effectively combat 

terrorism.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Buddhist and Franciscan 

monks will join the walk, as will leaders from various faith-based and peacemaking 

communities. Any persons who support a call for nonviolence are welcome to join 

in the walk as it moves north. On November 25, walkers will proceed to St. Aloysius 

Church (19 Eye Street) where they will welcome the public to a 6:30 p.m. gathering 

at the McKenna Center.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A large decorated school 

bus will shuttle walkers between cities. Daily itinerary updates available this 

website. This walk is endorsed by AFSC, FOR, Pax Christi USA, Peace Action USA, 

Veterans for Peace, War Resister&#146;s League, Voices in the Wilderness, and 

Women&#146;s International League for Peace and Freedom, among others. </font></p>
