- October 22  - Physicians for Social 

Responsibility today praised the progress reportedly being made 

by Presidents Bush and Putin toward reducing the nuclear 

arsenals of the two former Cold War adversaries. The US is 

considering cuts down to 2,500 strategic warheads or less while 

the Russians have suggested numbers as low as 1,500. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have been urging very deep cuts and then the elimination 

of nuclear weapons throughout the post-Cold War era,&quot; said PSR 

Executive Director and CEO Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H., in 

making the announcement. &quot;In the current climate, where we face 

serious potential for terrorist attacks and even nuclear ones, 

President Bush is in a position to go much further in 

eliminating nuclear weapons then any of his predecessors would 

have dared,&quot; added Musil. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to PSR, which shared the 1985 Nobel Prize for Peace 

for its work with Soviet physicians on the risks of nuclear war, 

several additional nuclear policies need to be addressed 

successfully in order to take advantage of the new US-Russian 

strategic partnership. In order to reduce the remaining risks of 

nuclear terror or inadvertent use of nuclear weapons, the two 

sides should immediately undertake very deep reductions of 

strategic weapons -- into the hundreds -- while developing plans 

to move more quickly to implement Article VI of the Nuclear 

Non-Proliferation Treaty. (The NPT commits the US, Russia and 

other nuclear powers to the elimination of nuclear weapons 

altogether.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We have already seen India and Pakistan develop nuclear 

weapons using US failure to eliminate as an excuse,&quot; said Musil. 

&quot;We now need to take the threat of further nuclear 

proliferation, like terrorist threats, far more seriously than 

we did before September 11.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR thus calls for speedy implementation of Article VI and the 

elimination of both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons from 

the US and Russian arsenals. The two sides have over 5,000 

tactical nuclear weapons that have no realistic military use and 

pose an unacceptable risk of diversion or theft, especially in 

Russia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR also considers President Bush's insistence on abrogating 

-- or negotiating into oblivion -- the ABM Treaty and moving 

ahead with NMD deployment a strategic blunder with long-range 

implications that can undermine US security when non-state, 

non-nuclear attacks need high priority. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NMD would have been absolutely useless on September 11,&quot; 

asserts PSR National Security Director Martin Butcher, &quot;and will 

continue to be so in the face of the numerous means in which a 

terrorists could employ nukes without using a missile.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since President Bush seeks multilateral cooperation for the 

war on terror, it makes little sense, PSR believes, to irritate 

and potentially disrupt future alliances with Russia and China 

in the name of a missile system that cannot prevent terrorist 

attacks. &quot;A program of nuclear elimination under the NPT, 

cooperative nuclear threat reduction, the signing of the CTBT, 

and other confidence measures will prove far more effective in 

the long run,&quot; says PSR's Musil. &quot;Presidents Bush and Putin have 

a chance to reshape the world. They should seize it.&quot; </font></p>
