- July 6 - I am here today to bring a message to the people of Puerto Rico from the American labor movement, and the message is that the 40 million people living in union households in North America are outraged at the bombing of Vieques.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not only are we outraged at the bombing, we are outraged at the treatment of peaceful demonstrators and at the hypocrisy of the Bush Administration in dealing with this awful situation&#151;a decision to stop the bombing two years from now is a non-decision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush isn't interested in stopping the bombing, he's interested only in stopping his own slide in the polls and in currying favor with Hispanic voters&#151;if he was seriously concerned, he would stop the bombing now and he would order the U.S. Navy to begin treating demonstrators properly, as peaceful patriots who are exercising their God-given right to disobey unjust laws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. Navy should be ashamed of the way its guards have behaved&#151;from the disgusting body search of Velda Gonzalez to the roughing up of Congressman Gutierrez, to the verbal and physical abuse of workers who were arrested while demonstrating&#151;including Dennis Rivera, a Vice President of the AFL-CIO and a member of our Executive Council.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By its actions, the Navy has shown that it is in a league with the infamous Bull Connor of Birmingham, Alabama, who changed the course of history by setting his dogs and water cannons loose on women and children demonstrating peacefully for civil rights in the 1960s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The physical danger of continued bombing has been documented in the media&#151;the implications for public health, the environment and the economy are devastating. But what hasn't been properly expressed is the damage this is doing to relations between Washington, DC and Puerto Rico, and to the gulf it is creating between the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico and the U.S. citizens of our 50 states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFL-CIO and our 65 affiliated unions call on President Bush to stop the bombing of Vieques immediately and to move U.S. troops out of the area. Only then can the healing begin and only then can this senseless confrontation be ended&#151;this isn't just a fight for the people of Vieques or the people of Puerto Rico, it's a struggle for all working families in North America and we won't stop fighting until we win.</font></p>
