- December 10 - Congresswoman Barbara 

Lee (D-Oakland) addressed nearly 1000 members of a growing 

faith-based peace movement at an interfaith worship service Sunday 

at the Agape International Spiritual Center in Culver City. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The service featured invocations by members of Christian, 

Muslim, Jewish, Native American and Bahai faiths and culminated in 

the lighting of the menorah for Hanukah and a call for peace by 

Rabbi Steven Jacobs. Rev. Dr. Michael Beckwith of Agape 

International Spiritual Center and long time civil rights activist 

Rev. James Lawson also took part in the service. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event was one in a series organized by Interfaith 

Communities United for Justice and Peace (ICUJP), a local coalition 

of more than 80 religious and secular organizations from many faith 

traditions. The coalition came together after the September 11th 

terrorist attacks to promote interfaith unity and alternatives to 

war. It is one of the largest and fastest growing pan-faith peace 

coalitions in the United States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ICUJP's basic premise is that faith-based communities have a 

crucial role in fostering peace and justice, and that organized 

religion must stop blessing war. This premise is gaining 

credibility. The coalition's previous service was attended by more 

than 800 people, and featured actor Martin Sheen and Congresswoman 

Diane Watson (D-Culver City). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congresswoman Lee was the only member of Congress to vote 

against the resolution authorizing President Bush to use &quot;all 

necessary and appropriate force&quot; against anyone associated with the 

terrorist attacks of September 11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I am convinced that military action will not prevent further 

acts of international terrorism against the United States,&quot; said 

Lee of her vote. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of the coalition agree, stating that while the war in 

Afghanistan has resulted in unknown numbers of civilian casualties, 

it has done very little to change the conditions that foster 

terrorism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fall of the Taliban has not made us any safer from 

terrorist attack,&quot; said Lisa Smithline, a member of Interfaith 

Communities United for Justice and Peace and the Agape 

International Spiritual Center. &quot;This movement is growing because 

people are recognizing that our safety depends on fundamental 

changes in policy that address the roots of terrorism.&quot; </font></p>
