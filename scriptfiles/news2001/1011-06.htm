Professor of media studies at New York University, Miller is author of <I>Boxed In: The Culture of TV</I> and author of the forthcoming <I>Spectacle: Operation Desert

Storm and the Triumph of Illusion</I>. He said today: "It's all too easy

to use the need for operational security as an excuse to abridge our democratic

freedoms.

Jackson is program director of the media watch group FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting). She said today: "White House officials have shown that they're going to

restrict and even manipulate information in this bombing campaign, but it's not

journalists' role to aid them in that effort. We need critical, independent

reporting now more than ever." Rendall, FAIR senior analyst, said today:

"Attempts at 'information control' always accompany U.S. military actions.

The White House's latest efforts to squelch dissent and shape the news are

chilling and out of place in an open society. Just as troubling is the

willingness of mainstream news outlets to sacrifice independent judgment to

government desires."

Silha Professor of Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota, Kirtley wrote the recent article "Fighting Back Against Information Shutdown, at Home and

Abroad." She said today: "The government's attempts to pressure the

media regarding the airing of bin Laden's statements are totally illegitimate.

Government directives like this, especially to a regulated industry like broadcast

and cable, carry the force of coercion, if not the force of law. The government

should not be the arbiter of what is appropriate for the public to see and

hear. What is one person's propaganda is another person's news."

Solomon is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy. He said today: "In May

1991, the Washington editors of 15 major American news organizations sent a

letter to Dick Cheney -- then secretary of defense -- decrying what they called

the Pentagon's 'virtually total control' over coverage of the Gulf War. Today,

the government's efforts to constrain media coverage are even more extreme. As

a practical matter, the First Amendment is in peril. The independence of news

media is essential to democracy."

Author of <I>Volunteer Slavery: My Authentic Negro Experience</I> and a columnist

for MSNBC, Nelson said today: "Freedom of the press and freedom to dissent

are as important now as they have ever been. The job of the media is not to act

as a cheerleader for politicians and the military -- we've seen this before to

our detriment."

A former producer with CNN and ABC's "20/20," Schechter is executive editor of the

MediaChannel website. "We seem to be in for a new period of censorship,

self-censorship and the muzzling of dissent," Schechter said. Meanwhile,

he commented, "music still has the power to do what journalism does so

rarely: reinforce empathy, caring and a sense of a world with other

possibilities."
