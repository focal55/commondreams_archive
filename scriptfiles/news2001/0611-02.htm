- June 11 -  In anticipation of an

announcement on climate change policy, the nation's leading

environmental organizations sent President Bush a letter stating

what the proposal would need to contain to be acceptable. (See

attached.) The groups laid out clear markers by which to judge the

President's proposal.

<p>It must have:

<p>-- A nationwide cap, or series of sectoral caps, on greenhouse

gas emissions at levels consistent with the Framework Convention

and the Kyoto Protocol; and

<p>-- Emissions caps that are binding, without "safety valve"

schemes that would allow businesses to continue polluting at

excessive levels.

<p>They stated that the hallmarks of an effective policy are:

<p>-- Measures substantially increasing corporate average fuel

economy for automobiles, sport utility vehicles and other light

trucks;

<p>-- Measures that clean up all four pollutants emitted by

electric power plants; and

<p>-- Measures to ensure widespread deployment and use of clean

renewable energy sources.

<p>President Bush is expected to announce a climate change proposal

today in preparation for meetings later this week with EU heads of

State in Gothenburg, Sweden.

<p>Below is a copy of the letter sent to President George W. Bush:

<p>BY FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION

<br>The President

<br>George W. Bush

<br>The White House

<br>Washington, DC 20500

<p>Dear Mr. President:

<p>As your administration completes its climate policy review, we

are writing to emphasize the importance of U.S. leadership on this

critical global environmental issue, and the importance of your

administration's adopting a credible policy for reducing greenhouse

gas emissions. We believe that the Kyoto Protocol provides the

critical foundation for a sound, long-term strategy for reducing

greenhouse gas emissions, and the threat climate change poses to

human health and biodiversity.

<p>In upcoming international meetings, including the U.S.-European

Summit, the G-8 Economic Summit, and the Conference of the Parties

to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the U.S. will

be called upon to come forward with proposals for addressing

climate change. You have stated that you take climate change

seriously and that your administration will propose new solutions.

We are concerned, however, by reports that you are considering

reliance solely on voluntary approaches, which have not prevented

emissions from steadily rising in the past and cannot be expected

to do so in the future. In addition, we are concerned by the large

increases in greenhouse gas emissions projected under your recent

energy plan.

<p>In our judgment, a credible and effective climate policy must

include a nationwide cap, or series of sectoral caps, on greenhouse

gas emissions at levels consistent with the Framework Convention

and the Kyoto Protocol. These emissions caps need to be binding,

without "safety valve" schemes that would allow businesses to

continue polluting at excessive levels.

<p>The hallmarks of an effective policy are measures substantially

increasing corporate average fuel economy for automobiles, sport

utility vehicles and other light trucks, cleaning up all four

pollutants emitted by electric power plants and ensuring widespread

deployment and use of clean renewable energy sources.

<p>Numerous studies, including analyses by Department of Energy

laboratories in 1997 and 2000, demonstrate that the U.S. can meet

ambitious emissions reductions targets and continue strong economic

growth. These policies will produce other important environmental

and economic benefits as well, including sharply reduced air

pollution and energy bill savings worth tens of billions of dollars

per year.

<p>Mr. President, time is running out to deal effectively with

global warming. As the National Academy of Sciences confirmed in

response to your request for additional scientific analysis, the

earth's temperature is in fact already rising as a result of

pollutants caused by human activity. Global warming is a real and

present danger to current and future generations. We urge you to

meet this threat with a credible and effective climate policy. A

policy that relies on voluntary measures will not meet these tests.

<p>Thank you for your consideration.&nbsp;

<p>Sincerely,

<br>&nbsp;

<br>
