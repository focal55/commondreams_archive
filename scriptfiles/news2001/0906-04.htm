- September 6 - Congressman Bernard Sanders (I-VT) today joined advocates for a National Housing Trust Fund to unveil a new study produced by the Center for Community change which shows that the proposed National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Bill, would generate 1.8 million new jobs and nearly $50 billion in wages.  According to the new findings, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund legislation (HR 2349) sponsored by Sanders, would benefit job seekers, home buyers, low and moderate income families and the economy as a whole. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders said, &quot;I am extremely pleased with the findings of this study, I hope this new information will help more of my colleagues in Congress understand both the need and benefit of providing affordable housing for all Americans.  There is no question that the issue of affordable housing is one of the most serious problems facing communities throughout America.  Millions of people today are spending 50% or more of their incomes on housing and finding it extremely difficult to afford the escalating cost of housing even if they are working full time.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders' legislation has gained momentum in recent weeks and is currently being co-sponsored by 78 members of Congress.   If passed, HR 2349 would use a portion of the Federal Housing Administration's profits, to create a trust fund from which states and non-profits could draw to build affordable housing rental units in mixed-income locations, to construct affordable homes for low to middle income citizens, and provide rental subsidies to low-income individuals.  According to housing experts, if the FHA surplus was used to build affordable housing, decent housing could be provided for more than 200,000 families next year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sanders concluded, &quot;In recent years, Congress has put money into the Highway Trust Find to be used strictly for highways; money into the Social Security Trust Fund which can be used only for Social Security; and money into the Airway Trust Fund to be used for aviation needs.  It is now time for Congress to, at the very least, use a portion for the Federal Housing Administration surplus to address the affordable housing crisis.&quot; </font></p>
