- June 19 - A House of Representatives 

appropriations committee today is expected to bust the Bush 

Administration's budget for the Army Corps of Engineers by more than 

$500 million, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a national 

budget watchdog organization. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;House appropriators have their hand stuck in the water project 

cookie jar,&quot; said Jeff Stein, budget analyst with Taxpayers for 

Common Sense. &quot;Congress continues to spend and spend, while the 

Administration wants them to go on a diet.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Corps of Engineers has argued that its budget was cut more 

than any other U.S. agency's was. However, the Administration's 

request of $3.9 billion is roughly comparable to recent budget 

requests for the Corps. The Administration proposes a budget that is 

actually a 2.4 percent increase over the $3.81 billion average spent 

on the Corps from FY 1995-2001, or taking into account inflation, a 

2.5 percent spending cut. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's budget recognizes that the Army Corps of Engineers 

is an agency in need of reform. In the last year, the Corps of 

Engineers has been rocked by scandals. Three senior Corps officials 

were reprimanded for manipulating the results of a major study to 

determine whether a $1.2 billion lock expansion project on the Upper 

Mississippi River was justified. At the same time the agency's 

construction backlog swelled to $54 billion -- 40 times its annual 

construction budget. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush budget allocates funds for 1,350 earmarked projects at a 

cumulative cost of $3.58 billion, a 10 percent reduction from last 

year's total funding. Hundreds of new projects are expected to be 

added in today appropriations committee meeting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is strong bipartisan support to bust the budget,&quot; continued 

Stein. &quot;Nothing will get in the way of this political pork parade.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several Members of Congress have suggested that the truncated 

transition following the election caused the budget cuts because new 

Administration officials had less time to thoroughly evaluate the 

nation's water resources needs. However, the TCS analysis found that 

the Corps budget is well thought out and follows priorities as set 

out in President Bush's budget blueprint, which was first released in 

early February. The budget proposes several key reforms: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Shifts funds away from low priority, underused waterways. 

Savings: $62,000,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Reduces the federal cost-share requirement for beach 

sand-pumping projects from 65 percent to 35 percent. For the first 

time in five years allocates funding for beach projects in an 

Administration's budget request, funding 49 beach projects. Overall 

savings on beach projects: $23,000,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Does not fund wastewater treatment and water supply, also known 

as environmental infrastructure projects. Savings: $90,000,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Does not allocate funding for 25 of the nation's most wasteful 

and unnecessary water projects. Savings: $79,547,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By increasing the budget, Congress is sending the message that 

when an agency cooks up numbers and breaks the rules, Congress will 

reward them with more money,&quot; concluded Stein. &quot;That's a ridiculous 

way to way policy.&quot; </font></p>
