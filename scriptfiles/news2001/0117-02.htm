- January 17 -  The following was released

today by the National Parks Conservation Association, the Sierra

Club and the Western Environmental Law Center:

<p>Metropolitan Water District (MWD) met Tuesday to discuss its

financial agreement with Cadiz, Inc., regarding its proposal to

sell water from a groundwater aquifer that underlies Mojave

National Preserve and several federally protected wildernesses.

Public interest organizations decry the deal, saying it would be

disastrous for southern California water users and could destroy

extraordinary public lands in the California desert.

<p>Cadiz, Inc., a private agricultural corporation based in Santa

Monica, proposes to pump out native groundwater from an aquifer and

pump in water from the Colorado River for additional withdrawal.

<p>Project critics protest the apparent haste to close a deal

between the agency and corporation. Last week, the MWD directors

were given only a day to review and vote on the drafted agreement.

Protesting directors asked that the vote be delayed until Feb. 13.

Tuesday's meeting gave directors a chance to express their concerns

about the project.

<p>"Metropolitan Water District must act on behalf of the best

interests of its customers in Los Angeles and San Diego. They have

a public responsibility to take the time needed to better

understand the commitment they are being asked to make, instead of

acting like this is a shotgun wedding," reflects Elden Hughes of

the Sierra Club.

<p>Cadiz, Inc. grows fruit in the California desert and has

suffered financial declines over the past two years. The potential

water project has propped up the faith of their investors and

creditors. "Cadiz already has an 84 percent debt to 16 percent

equity ratio. This is not a sound business partner. The MWD

shouldn't allow itself or its customers to be pressured into this

deal. The MWD is responsible for providing customers with a safe,

affordable and reliable water supply, not corporate bail-out,"

states Simeon Herskovits, senior attorney at the Western

Environmental Law Center. (Further information on Cadiz, Inc.'s

financial status can be read at

<a href="http://www.axelsabyss.com/cadiz10q.html">http://www.axelsabyss.com/cadiz10q.html</a>)

<p>"We can't stand by and watch the MWD ignore this opportunity to

carefully consider its alternatives, including more efficient use

of currently available water and facilities. If the MWD signs this

agreement, how are they going to explain to the public who fought

for the California Desert Protection Act to protect these precious

and extraordinary lands that depend upon this aquifer?" asks Steven

Krefting, Pacific regional director of the National Parks

Conservation Association.

<p>Controversy has beset the Cadiz project for the past year on a

number of fronts: criticism of the inflated estimates of available

water, alarm over potentially carcinogenic chromium 6 in the water

supply, questions about the company's legal rights to the water,

concern that draining the aquifer will devastate federally

protected desert lands and cause massive dust storms, and the

threat of environmental litigation to stop the project.

<p>The coalition of environmental organizations that wrote comments

critical of the project include Sierra Club, National Parks

Conservation Association, Defenders of Wildlife, Wilderness

Society, California Wilderness Coalition, Desert Survivors, Desert

Citizens Against Pollution, California Citizens Against Toxics,

Southern California Watershed Alliance, California Watershed

Network, Butte Environmental Council, Valley Water Protection

Association, Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Community

Action and Environmental Justice, and Citizens for the Chuckwalla

Valley. The coalition's comments can found at

<p>The Metropolitan Water District is expected to vote on the

agreement on Feb. 13, 2001 at the Metropolitan Water District

Headquarters in Los Angeles.
