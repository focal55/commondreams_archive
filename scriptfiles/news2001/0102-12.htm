- January 2 - The nomination of former Senator Spencer Abraham and former Colorado

  Attorney General Gale Norton to head the departments of Energy and Interior,

  respectively, is a giant step backwards for environmental protection, the

  League of Conservation Voters (LCV) concluded today.  Bush announced Abraham’s nomination today

  and Norton’s last Friday.

<p>&quot;We are stunned by

  President-elect Bush’s appointment of Abraham, a member of LCV’s 2000 Dirty

  Dozen list, and our number one target for defeat last year,&quot; said LCV

  President Deb Callahan.  &quot;He even

  co-sponsored a bill to abolish the very department he’s been nominated to

  lead.  In Norton, Bush has nominated

  someone whose environmental ethic is a throwback to the James Watt era -- one

  of the darkest periods of natural resource exploitation.  These appointments don’t reflect the

  reality that conservatism and conservation shouldn’t be treated as

  conflicting values.&quot;</p>

	 <p>Abraham, who served as a U.S. Senator from Michigan

  from 1995 to 2000, compiled an abysmal lifetime LCV environmental voting

  score of five percent -- the worst in Michigan and the worst in the Great

  Lakes region.  In the last Congress,

  Abraham earned a failing score of zero percent.  LCV named Abraham to its 2000 Dirty Dozen list of

  anti-environment congressional candidates and spent $700,000 in a successful

  effort to inform voters of his anti-environment record and ensure his

  defeat.  In 1999, Abraham was one of

  four senators to sponsor a bill to abolish the Energy Department.  Also that year, he voted against stronger

  fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks and to cut funding for

  renewable energy programs.  Abraham also supported numerous legislative

  riders to eliminate the EPA’s role in protecting wetlands and to prohibit the

  EPA from regulating arsenic in drinking water.  In 1998, he supported a rider to the Fiscal Year 2000 Interior

  Appropriations bill that would have legalized unlimited mine waste dumping on

  public lands.  In 2000,

  Abraham’s re-election campaign accepted more campaign contributions from

  polluting industries and interests than any other congressional candidate --

  over $700,000.</p>

	 <p>Norton is a protégé of James Watt, President

  Reagan's controversial Interior secretary from 1981 to 1983.  She worked for Watt while he was president

  of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative organization that

  strongly supports &quot;takings&quot; legislation and logging and mining on the

  nation’s public lands.  She also

  served in the Reagan administration, first in the Agriculture Department and

  then in the Interior Department where she helped advocate for the Reagan

  administration’s position on oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife

  Refuge.  As Colorado Attorney General,

  Norton was instrumental in creating the state’s &quot;self audit&quot; program, which

  gives businesses immunity from litigation and fines if they voluntarily

  report and correct violations of environmental laws.  She is also a former co-chair of the Coalition

  of Republican Environmental Advocates (CREA), an industry-funded front

  group whose members include such anti-environment foes as Representative

  Chenoweth-Hage and House Resources Committee Chairman Don Young. </p>

	 

<p>&quot;Abraham and

  Norton’s nominations are terrible news for the majority of Americans who rank

  protecting the nation’s air, water and national resources among their top

  priorities,&quot; said LCV President Deb Callahan. &quot;While Bush’s appointment of

  Christie Todd Whitman to head the </p>

<p>Environmental

  Protection Agency appeared to be a step in the right direction, his choices

  of Abraham and Norton are signs of environmental regress, not progress.&quot;</p>

<p>To date, Bush has

  nominated Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta to be secretary of

  Transportation.  Mineta, a Democratic

  member of the House from 1975 to 1995, earned a lifetime environmental

  average of 75 percent. In addition, John Ashcroft has been nominated to serve

  as attorney general.  Ashcroft, a

  former U.S. Senator from Missouri, earned a lifetime LCV environmental rating

  of five percent for his votes on key environmental legislation from 1995 to

  2000.  He repeatedly voted against

  funding for clean air and water and against increased funding for the cleanup

  of toxic waste sites.  Bush

  has also named Ann Veneman as his choice for agriculture secretary and Donald

  Evans, Bush campaign chairman and the chairman of an oil company, as commerce

  secretary.  Both Evans and Veneman will

  have significant jurisdiction over key environmental policies pertaining to

  such hot-button environmental issues as genetically modified food, trade and

  environment, and marine and coastal protections.</p>

<p><i>The

  League of Conservation Voters is the political voice for the national

  environmental community. LCV has published a Scorecard for each Congress since 1970.  The votes tabulated in the Scorecards are based on the

  consensus recommendation of experts from 25 nonpartisan environmental,

  conservation and sportsmen’s groups. 

  The Scorecard assigns a

  percentage score to every representative and senator. A 100 percent score

  indicates the strongest environmental commitment, while a zero percent shows

  a consistent voting pattern against conservation and public health

  protections. LCV is working full-time to monitor administration appointments

  and actions that affect the environment.&nbsp; Information on LCV’s efforts

  pertaining to the administration will be made available to reporters and over

  the Internet at <a href="http://www.lcv.org">www.lcv.org</a>.&nbsp;
