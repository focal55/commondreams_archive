- January 4 -  Probable new environmental committee chairmen are poised to lead environmental policy in the wrong direction, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) announced today.  The new leaders of the 107th Congress&#146; committees with environmental jurisdiction are among the most anti-environment members of Congress according to their performance on LCV&#146;s National Environmental Scorecard and do not reflect the growing public desire for stronger environmental laws.<br>

	  <br>

	 With an average environmental score for the 106th Congress of seven percent, the new chairmen rank far below the national average for House members (47 percent).  Such poor past performance on important conservation and public health protection issues leaves little room for optimism that environmental progress will be made in these committees.  <br>

	  <br>

	 &#147;The American public has clearly signaled its desire for stronger, better enforced environmental laws - not weaker ones,&#148; said Deb Callahan, LCV president.  &#147;We learned valuable lessons from the 2000 congressional elections: smart environmental policy makes smart local politics and bad environmental policy can lead to bad news on election day.  Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike benefit from cleaner air, safer water, and open spaces, which could be at risk with the election of these new chairmen.&#148;  <br>

	  <br>

	 The probable chairmen of key committees and appropriations subcommittees are:<br>

	  <br>

	 Jim Hansen (R-Utah), House Resources Committee<br>

	 106th Congress LCV score:                     10%                Lifetime LCV score:                9%

<p>

	 Billy Tauzin (R-La.), House Energy and Commerce Committee            <br>

	 106th Congress LCV score:                     7%                Lifetime LCV score:                21%</p>

	 <p>

	 Don Young (R-Alaska), House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee            <br>

	 106th Congress LCV score:                     7%                Lifetime LCV score:                10%</p>

	 <p>

	 Joe Skeen (R-N.M.), House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee     <br>

	 106th Congress LCV score:                     7%                Lifetime LCV score:                9%</p>

	 <p>

	 Sonny Callahan (R-Ala.), House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee<br>

	 106th Congress LCV score:                     3%                Lifetime LCV score:                7%<br>

	  <br>

	 Callahan added, &#147;Hostile anti-environmental legislation during the last Congress met with opposition from environmentalists, the public, and the Administration.  With the president&#146;s veto threat now questionable and a closely divided Congress, the environmental community will have to be even more vigilant in its efforts to hold these committee chairmen and the rest of Congress accountable to the public for their environmental actions.&#148;<br>

	  <br>

	 Returning chairmen of House panels with environmental jurisdiction include Larry Combest (R-TX) at the Agriculture Committee (106th Congress LCV score: 7 percent) and James Walsh (R-N.Y.) at the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee (106th Congress LCV score: 37 percent).<br>

	  <br>

	 <i>The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is the political voice of the national environmental and conservation community.  LCV is the only national organization working full-time to hold members of Congress accountable for their environmental votes.  For each session of Congress, LCV produces the National Environmental Scorecard that assigns a percentage score to each representative and senator based on their votes on the year&#146;s key environmental measures.</i><br>
