- September 4 - With the start of the school year, Education Secretary Rod Paige is speaking today at the National Press Club. The following analysts are available for

interviews:

<P><LI>JOHN TAYLOR GATTO, <A HREF="mailto:info@johntaylorgatto.com">

Former New York State Teacher of the Year and author of the recently released book <I>The

Underground History of American Education</I>, Gatto said today:

"Education used to be about instilling people with good ethics. It then

incorporated the notion of teaching people how to be good citizens and then

having people achieve their own personal best. All these have merit, but the

education system is now being geared to making people into human resources for

the benefit of corporations and government -- into a workforce. We are

schooling people into having no inner life; instead, we are fashioning children

into raw material for the commercial and government elite." Gatto, a

participant in a forum in the current issue of <I>Harper's Magazine</I>, added:

"In order to make management most efficient, the working body is made to

be childish because childish people are not independent. But if our schools

started producing people capable of independent thought, that would undermine

this economy. Contrary to popular belief, the fastest growing jobs require

little skills from people. We're producing people who would accept fast-food

jobs.... There are huge amounts of free talent available that the schools don't

access, like retired people."

<P><LI>EDWARD KEALY, <A HREF="mailto:ekealy@cef.org">

Executive director of the Committee for Education Funding, Kealy said today: "The

administration is putting forward the notion of 'Leaving No Child Behind,' but

the fiscal year starts Oct. 1 and no appropriations have been made for

education. We don't see the resources for the results that the president and

Secretary Paige have said they seek."

<P><LI>EMILY HEATH, <A HREF="mailto:emily@commercialfree.org">

emily@commercialfree.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.commercialfree.org" target="_new">www.commercialfree.org</A><BR>

Senior program director with the Center for Commercial-Free Public Education, Heath said

today: "Students are supposed to be in school to learn -- particularly

critical thinking skills. But companies are seeking to commercialize the

schools, teaching them instead to be obedient consumers -- to buy, buy, buy.

Companies are using taxpayer funds and the fact that students are a captive

audience. Commercialism enters the schools in several ways. Channel One, the TV

news and advertising program broadcast into schools, is the largest example of

direct advertising. Channel One forces students to watch two minutes of TV

commercials every school day -- students are not even allowed to read during

the commercials. It now reaches about 40 percent of middle and high schools.

Commercialism also gets into schools through exclusive beverage contracts -- in

spite of claims earlier this year from Coca-Cola that they would cut down on

promoting soda to kids, we've seen no evidence of that. You also have banners

in schools with corporate logos and other 'freebies' that are clearly a form of

advertising. Another way that commercialism gets into classrooms is by

disguising public relations material to look like classroom activities and

lesson plans. Exxon and Shell have put together science curriculum material to

serve their purposes. There were even ads in textbooks a few years ago, but a

California state law was passed banning that."
