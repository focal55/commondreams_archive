- November 7 - Members of Congress from 

both sides of the aisle, civic groups, and popstars today called on 

President Bush and the US Congress to provide $1.2 billion in 

emergency funds to combat the global scourges of HIV/AIDS, 

tuberculosis, and malaria. The funds would go primarily to the 

international Global Health Fund for AIDS, tuberculosis and 

malaria, which requires approximately $10 billion annually to be 

fully operational, but to which the US is contributing just $250 

million. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Those of us working in Africa to stop AIDS welcome this 

determined effort, which all Americans should join,&quot; stated 

Chatinkha Nkhoma, Africa Program Director of the Global AIDS 

Alliance. &quot;US resources are needed now more than ever, to save 

lives and help create a more peaceful world&quot; stated Dr. Paul Zeitz, 

Executive Director of the Global AIDS Alliance. The CIA in a 

recent report identified AIDS and other diseases as a major threat 

to stability and security in affected regions, and the epidemic of 

tuberculosis is a major threat in Pakistan and Afghanistan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 70 members of Congress have signed a letter to President 

Bush calling for an emergency appropriation this fiscal year. In 

the Senate, the appeal was authored by Senator Patrick Leahy 

(D-VT). Senators including Mikulski (D-MD), Feinstein (D-CA), 

Durbin (D-IL), and Murray (D-WA) also signed the letter to the 

President. In the House, the letter was originated by 

Representatives Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jim Leach (R-IA), John Conyers 

(D-MI), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Connie Morella (R-MD). Over 60 

of their House colleagues joined them, including Ileana 

Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Rep. Mark Foley (R-FL), and Rep. Maxine Waters 

(D-CA). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The US has responded with great urgency to the attacks of 

September 11th, but we and the world have yet to mobilize to combat 

AIDS, the worst public health emergency in half a millennium,&quot; said 

Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). &quot;Far more resources are needed to 

prevent the deaths of tens of millions of people, and we are asking 

the President to make this the priority it deserves.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At the dawn of the 21st Century, the world confronts one of the 

most serious and urgent public health challenges in the history of 

mankind,&quot; stated Rep. Jim Leach. &quot;It is self-evident that the 

United States has a national as well as humanitarian interest in 

helping to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Infectious diseases of 

this nature know no borders.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I was encouraged by Secretary General Colin Powell's message of 

hope last night that America would not let terrorism distract it 

from battling the AIDS epidemic in Africa,&quot; said Congresswoman 

Barbara Lee (D-CA) &quot;Today, we present an opportunity for the 

United States to further its commitment to that crucial endeavor by 

providing more resources to the global AIDS fund.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 130 non-governmental organizations also sent an appeal for 

emergency action to the President. These groups included such 

humanitarian, religious, civil rights, professional and activist 

organizations as the Global AIDS Alliance, Church World Service, 

the Episcopal Church, African Faith and Justice Network, Detroit 

Catholic Pastoral Alliance, Health GAP Coalition, Student Global 

AIDS Campaign, Hope for African Children Initiative, RESULTS, 

NAACP, League of United Latin American Citizens, American Jewish 

World Service, Society for Women and AIDS in Africa, American 

Nurses Association, Jubilee USA Network, Global Health Council, 

Physicians for Human Rights and many more. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirty-five pop stars also joined the urgent call for action. 

Such artists as Bono, Destiny's Child, NSYNC, Nelly Furtado, 

Christina Aguilera, Ja Rule, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, 

Alicia Keyes, Wyclef Jean, Mary J Blige, and many more wrote to 

Senators and Representatives this week to urge them to sign the 

letters to the President. These artists, in partnership with 

Artists Against AIDS Worldwide (AAAW), have re-recorded several new 

mixes of Marvin Gaye's hit &quot;What's Going On&quot; in order to raise 

funds for AIDS programs in Africa as well as the September 11th 

Fund. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;'What's Going On' is a wake up call to President Bush and our 

Congress,&quot; stated actress and singer Nona Gaye, who is the daughter 

of Marvin Gaye. &quot;As a first step, we want $1.2 billion in emergency 

funds to stop AIDS in Africa this year.&quot; </font></p>
