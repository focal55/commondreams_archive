- January 24 -  As the Senate confirmation hearing for Elaine Chao gets underway, the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families today urged Senators to ensure that anyone confirmed to this critical post will respect the rights of working women and their families. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Secretary of Labor has tremendous influence and enforcement authority over equality, safety and health protections in America's workplaces, and policies that help millions of employees balance work and family obligations,&quot; said National Partnership for Women &amp; Families General Counsel Donna R. Lenhoff. &quot;Senators must explore Chao's positions on these critical issues to make sure she is the right choice for the job.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao would be responsible for enforcing: </font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the cornerstone of protections for working families. Over 35 million Americans have relied on the FMLA since it became law in 1993 to make sure that they didn't have to choose between their jobs and their families in times of compelling family needs, like with the birth or adoption of a new baby, or the illness of a parent. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New Department of Labor regulations, which allow states to let new parents collect unemployment compensation during their parental leaves. These regulations provide states with an innovative and practical solution to the problem of unpaid parental leave -- a problem so serious that 78 percent of people who need but don't take leave cite their reason as inability to afford unpaid leave. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The federal minimum wage and overtime law, which ensures that American employees are not exploited by having to work too many hours or for substandard wages. In fact, women workers -- especially those who recently have moved from welfare to work -- are the majority of minimum wage earners, and rely on overtime protections to help them balance their family responsibilities.</font></li>

</ul>
