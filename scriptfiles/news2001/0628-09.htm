pollution reduction. Please call 202-667-4500, ext. 209 to arrange 

an interview after 2:30 p.m. on Friday. </font></p>

Statements and interviews after 2:30 p.m. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY: The Bush administration recently initiated a 90-day review 

process to examine New Source Review, a key program in the Clean 

Air Act that requires new and existing industrial facilities to use 

modern pollution reduction technology. The administration is 

reconsidering this program in response to claims by oil and utility 

companies that the pollution reduction requirements are too 

stringent. The Wall Street Journal reported June 28th that the 

Bush administration is doing more than reviewing the program. 

According to the report, the Justice Department has frozen all 

pending New Source Review enforcement actions that are part of a 

major crack down begun under the Clinton administration to stop 

illegal polluting by oil refineries and dirty power plants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The six residents each live near sprawling oil refineries in 

Louisiana and Texas. They are opposed to the Bush energy plan's 

reconsideration of New Source Review, a key program that can reduce 

the air pollution released by the huge oil refineries in their 

communities. Residents are traveling to Washington, DC to 

personally urge that the EPA continue and strengthen New Source 

Review enforcement. They will present reports and other data 

showing the relationship between oil refinery pollution, asthma and 

other severe health problems suffered by residents in their 

communities. They will also discuss the need for EPA's continued 

enforcement of New Source Review and its oversight of Texas and 

Louisiana environmental agencies, which have a record of poor environmental enforcement. </font></p>
