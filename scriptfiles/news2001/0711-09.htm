- July 11 - As part of the ExxonMobil International Day of Action, a coalition of groups called on the oil giant to support the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, cancel drilling plans for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and respect human rights around the world. Activists in Washington, D.C. converged at the Capitol Hill ExxonMobil gas station in one of more than 150 actions held around the world. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time for ExxonMobil to finally start behaving like a responsible corporate citizen,&quot; said Athan Manuel, Director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group's Arctic Wilderness Campaign. &quot;Today we join activists around the world in calling on ExxonMobil to respect the Arctic, respect the planet, and respect the people for a change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to being one of the world's largest and most profitable companies, ExxonMobil is also one of the most reckless, according to the groups. On March 24, 1989 the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound in Alaska, leading to one of the worst environmental disasters in American history. According to the coalition of groups, the wreck of the Exxon Valdez and Exxon's handling of the spill became the poster child for corporate irresponsibility. In the last twelve years, ExxonMobil has not shown much improvement. The groups pointed out that:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil refuses to acknowledge the reality and consequences of global warming, contrary to overwhelming scientific evidence and in contrast to their colleagues at BP, Shell and Texaco. Not only do they mislead their shareholders and the public on the issue, ExxonMobil funds questionable researchers and think-tanks in an effort to justify their claim that we do not know whether global warming is happening.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil is aggressively lobbying to open up the last remaining wilderness in America's Arctic, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for oil and gas drilling.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Indonesia, ExxonMobil has hired the Indonesian military to provide security for ExxonMobil facilities in the Aceh region. According to a lawsuit filed against ExxonMobil by the International Labor Rights Fund, troops stationed at the company's facilities tortured, raped and murdered local villagers. Many of these crimes took place on ExxonMobil property.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Chad and Cameroon, ExxonMobil is leading a consortium of investors developing the Doba oil fields and a 663 mile-long pipeline through Cameroon. ExxonMobil has yet to develop an adequate response plan to potential oil spills, which would threaten the rainforest of Cameroon and the farmlands of Chad. The project is also supporting the rule of two notoriously corrupt and violent governments. The government of Chad has admitted to using part of the project's $25 million signing bonus to purchase arms and, last month, it arrested and tortured one of the leading opposition candidates and most vocal critic of the project, wounded fourteen women including a human rights activist.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Exxon Mobil should refuse to be involved in countries that are corrupt and violent towards their people&quot;, said Delphine Djiraibe of the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights &quot;We ask that ExxonMobil suspend its activities until human rights are respected and new democratic elections are held.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the International Day of Action, activists around the world called on ExxonMobil to: support the Kyoto Protocol and reduce emissions that contribute to global warming; stop pushing for drilling in the Arctic Refuge and on other public lands; agree to an investigation by an international human rights tribunal and abide by its findings; invest the $7.9 billion it currently spends on exploration into renewable energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today we turned up the heat on ExxonMobil and President Bush to take real steps to prevent drilling in the Arctic Refuge, stop global warming, and be accountable for their actions&quot;, said Christy Leavitt, Director of Free The Planet. &quot;Students and consumers are not going to tolerate corporate attacks on the environment and human rights.&quot;</font></p>
