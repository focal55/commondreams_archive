- June 28 - The Green Party condemns the

current fight in Congress over HMO accountability as a

distraction from the goal of guaranteed health care

for every American.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Competing bills, now facing Congressional votes and a

threatened White House veto, represent a minor advance

in the movement for accountability of managed care

corporations.  But the bills are a sham that will

provide no overall improvement in the current health

care system.  Most states already have better laws on

the books; the federal law would only add the

federally-regulated ERISA plans to the majority of

plans now regulated by the states.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As long as Congress continues to debate side issues

like the right to sue one's HMO or employer and damage

caps, they can avoid the real crisis -- 44 million

uninsured Americans and inadequate coverage for many

of those with insurance,&quot; said Scott McLarty, media

co-coordinator for the Association of State Green

Parties, member of the D.C. Statehood Green Party, and

former ACT UP activist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. has the best medical technology and

resources in the world, but a failed delivery system. 

That's what HMOs, insurance firms, and drug

manufacturers don't want us to talk about. Most

Americans want the same access to health care that

people in every other industrialized nation have. 

Single-payer national health insurance is the only

solution.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Patients' Rights laws, whether introduced by Senators

McCain and Edwards or by Senators Frist, Jefford, and

Breaux, are band-aids at best and may even cause an

increase in people without insurance,&quot; added Carol

Miller, a New Mexico Green and public health advocate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The laws would do nothing to provide treatment for

more than 44 million uninsured Americans, or to compel

HMOs and insurance companies to cover people who need

health care the most -- those with pre-existing

conditions or chronic illnesses like AIDS, and older

Americans.  And despite the media's endless coverage

of the right to sue, most aggrieved patients will

never take legal action.  Many are too physically or

mentally debilitated to undertake a lawsuit against

HMOs and insurance companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens favor publicly-run health and social services

instead of profit-driven private corporations, and

oppose the corporate take-over of publicly owned

services and resources, such as the plan to turn

Social Security into a Wall Street investment scheme,

school vouchers, corporate disbursal of welfare

benefits, the contracts with Dyncorp for mercenary

operations under Plan Colombia, and the rise of

incarceration in private prisons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party demands national health insurance

based on the single-payer model, and joins with

Physicians for a National Health Program, the Labor

Party, and many labor unions, medical organizations,

and citizens' groups to work for its enactment. Under

such a system, all Americans would be covered

regardless of age, ability to pay, residence,

employment, or prior medical condition.  Physicians

and hospitals would compete for consumers on the basis

of quality of care, not cost.  The plan would be

funded through a progressive tax which, for most

Americans -- especially poor, low-, and middle-income

people -- would be less than what we now pay for

private and employer-based coverage.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Democratic Party endorsed national health

insurance in 1948, but discarded the idea in 1996 when

it was removed from the national Democrat Party

platform.  Universal health care was absent from the

Democrat and Republican national campaigns in 1996 and

2000 and missing from Al Gore's 2000 platform.

Instead, Gore and Bush debated small incremental ideas

for adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and

the so-called patients rights proposals.  Only Ralph

Nader discussed national health insurance, but he was

barred from the presidential debates; the mainstream

media mostly ignored his call for health care justice.</font></p>
