- June 13 - Protesting the United State&#146;s national missile defense and climate change agendas, Greenpeace activists blocked the gates of the Brussels military airport where Bush arrived this morning. Another activist circled the airport in a motorized parachute with a banner reading, &#147;Stop Star Wars.&#148;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 17 activists chained themselves to the airport gates, forming a human chain and carrying banners reading &#147;George Bush&#151;Outlaws not welcome&#148; and &#147;GW Bush wanted for crimes against the planet.&#148; The activists, who hailed from Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Israel, Australia and the U.S. were all arrested.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, more than 300 activists from environment and peace groups, including Greenpeace, For Mother Earth and War Resisters International demonstrated outside NATO headquarters in Brussels where Bush was meeting with NATO Heads of State. President Bush reportedly avoided the protesters by heading through a side door.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;President Bush cannot continue to slip through the side door and ignore the wants of the American people and our allies around the world,&#148; said Gordon Clark, Greenpeace USA nuclear disarmament coordinator. &#147;He must hear what our allies are saying, which is &#145;no&#146; to Stars Wars and &#145;yes&#146; to the Kyoto Protocol, and act accordingly.&#148; Clark, was one of the protesters on the scene at the NATO headquarters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior to coming to Europe to meet with government leaders and NATO foreign ministers, Bush made a speech in the Rose Garden, reiterating his plans to reject the Kyoto Protocol. Also, White House administration officials announced earlier in the week that it plans to deploy a national missile defense system by 2004. Bush cannot proceed on his national missile defense plan without European support and participation. The U.S. needs to use key radar facilities at Fylingdales in the United Kingdom and at Thule in Greenland. Denmark controls Greenland&#146;s defense and foreign policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush's promised consultations with his European allies over Star Wars deployment and climate change policies are a total sham,&quot; said William Peden, Greenpeace International disarmament campaigner. &#147;His message to the world is clearly like it or lump it.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's protest follows Greenpeace actions in Spain yesterday for President Bush's arrival in Europe; in France and in Norway against US oil tankers; and in Finland over the weekend when U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld discussed Star Wars with Baltic Defense Ministers.</font></p>
