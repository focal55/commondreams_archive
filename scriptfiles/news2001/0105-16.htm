- January 5 - The League of Conservation Voters

  (LCV) today applauded President Clinton’s ban on new roadbuilding on 58.5

  million acres of national forests in 38 states, including 9 million acres in

  Alaska’s Tongass National Forest.  The

  initiative, which Clinton signed today, will take effect in 60 days.

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;Today’s announcement further demonstrates

  President Clinton’s dedication to leaving a livable legacy for future generations and to

  ensuring that

  important natural treasures like the Tongass Forest are protected as some of

  our last remaining pristine spaces,&quot; said LCV President Deb Callahan.  </p>

	 <p style='text-align:justify'>According to the League, both Congress and the new

  Bush administration appear poised to overturn some of President Clinton’s

  many environmental initiatives.  While

  campaigning for president, Bush promised to reverse, if possible, President

  Clinton’s roadbuilding proposal, which at the time did not include the

  Tongass.  In addition, Vice

  President-elect Dick Cheney has vowed to review and possibly rescind some of

  President Clinton’s new national monument designations.  Representative James Hansen (R-Utah), who

  was named House Resources chairman yesterday, has already proposed working

  with the Bush administration to dismantle some of the Clinton

  administration’s most prominent natural resource conservation efforts.</p>

	 

<p style='text-align:justify'>Bush’s choices of former Michigan Senator Spencer

  Abraham for Energy secretary and former Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton

  for Interior secretary are also clear signs that increased resource

  extraction on public lands will be a priority for the Bush administration.  Both Abraham and Norton support oil

  drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Abraham, who was named to LCV’s 2000 Dirty Dozen list of

  anti-environment congressional candidates, had a failing lifetime

  environmental rating of five percent for his votes on key environmental

  legislation while in office.  Norton worked for the

  Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), which at the time was headed by

  controversial Reagan Interior Secretary James Watt.  MSLF is a conservative organization that strongly supports

  &quot;takings&quot; legislation and logging and mining on the nation’s public

  lands.  As Colorado attorney general

  she was instrumental in creating the state’s &quot;self audit&quot; program, which

  allows companies to avoid penalties when they violate environmental laws if

  they report the violations themselves. 

  Environmentalists oppose this type of program, calling it a &quot;get out

  of jail free&quot; card for polluters.  </p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>&quot;While the Clinton administration in its final

  days continues to make forward-thinking progress on environmental protection,

  it appears that the Bush administration -- based on the nominations of Norton

  and Abraham to key environmental cabinet positions -- may be ready to turn

  back the clock on natural resource protection,&quot; Callahan said.  &quot;The majority of Americans support

  stronger environmental protections. Clean air, clean water and our public

  lands need not be sacrificed in order to have successful energy and natural

  resource policies.&quot;</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><i>LCV is the political voice for the national

  environmental community. LCV’s Scorecard

  is published each session of Congress. Members of Congress are assigned a

  percentage score based on their votes on key environmental legislation. A 100

  percent score indicates the strongest environmental commitment, while a zero

  percent shows a consistent voting pattern against conservation and public

  health protections. LCV is working full-time to monitor administration

  appointments and actions that affect the environment.&nbsp; Information on

  LCV’s efforts pertaining to the administration will be made available to

  reporters and over the Internet at <a href="http://www.lcv.org">www.lcv.org</a>.&nbsp; </i>
