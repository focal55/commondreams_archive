<p>The nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of Interior



signals that President-elect Bush is not interested in a balanced



approach to environment and natural resources issues.

<p>Norton spent four years as a staffer at the Mountain States



Legal Foundation, whose alumni include Reagan's infamous Secretary



of Interior James Watt and Ann Gorsuch, Reagan's EPA Administrator.

<p>The agenda of the Mountain States Legal Foundation has included



aggressive litigation against environmental protections, a



"takings" agenda to pay polluters to obey the law, an effort to



dismantle the Endangered Species Act, and a campaign to deny the



seriousness of air pollution and the existence of global warming.

<p>The foundation was a sponsor of the first "wise use" conference



in 1988. The "wise use" movement has laid out an extensive



anti-environmental agenda, including opening all wilderness and



national parks to mineral and energy production under wise use



technologies.

<p>"The nomination of Gale Norton amounts to a declaration of war



on the environment," said Dr. Brent Blackwelder, President of



Friends of the Earth.

<p>The Mountain States Legal Foundation received donations from



over 175 corporations in 1977, its first year of operation.



Contributors to the organization have included Exxon, Amoco,



Phillips 66, Marathon Oil, Ford Motor Company, and Chevron. "It's



no wonder that Norton supports drilling in the Arctic National



Wildlife Refuge," Blackwelder said.

<p>The Secretary of Interior is responsible for management of the



majority of the federally owned lands in the United States, having



jurisdiction over about 70 percent of the 740 million acres of



these lands (roughly one third of the total land area of our



nation). "At a time when we need stewardship and restoration of our



public lands after a century of abuse, Norton is looking toward a



new century of continued plunder and exploitation," Blackwelder



said.

<p>Norton has been associated with a number of extreme "property



rights" groups. She was a member of the legal Advisory Council for



Defenders of Property Rights and of the Farm Credit Bank Property



Rights Task Force.

<p>Norton has been national chairman of the Coalition for



Republican Environmental Advocates whose steering committee



includes registered lobbyists for the oil, auto, mining, and



alcoholic beverage industries. Honorary board members of this



Coalition include some members of Congress with the worst



environmental records such as Pombo (R-Cal), Don Young (R-Alaska)



and Sen. Larry Craig (R-Id). While this Coalition is trying to pass



itself off as a pro-environment grassroots group, it has been



funded by Coors Brewing Company, the American Forest Paper



Association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, ARCO, Amoco,



and the Ford Company. "Norton's chairmanship of this Coalition



suggests readiness to participate in a gross deception of the



public," Blackwelder said.

<p>Norton's pattern of operation is clear: she associates with the



hard-core anti-environmental organizations. She is willing to use



all sorts of code words to sound reasonable and even



pro-environment, but behind the scenes, she is against regulations



to protect the environment and is eager to move forward with an



extensive program of natural resource exploitation.
