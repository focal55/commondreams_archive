- July 16 - Sierra Club Blows the Whistle on the Bush Energy Plan

In Events Across the Country, Activists Push for Quicker, Cleaner, Cheaper

and Safer Solutions</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to President Bush's latest efforts to promote an energy plan

that makes the wrong choices, Sierra Club activists are fanning out in

cities and towns across America today to voice opposition to the

Administration's plan and to advocate for energy efficiency, energy

conservation, and environmentally responsible production.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today the Bush Administration is trying to breathe life back into their

energy initiative, but this is a 'dead plan walking.' Americans have

rejected the President's energy plan because it won't clean up our air,

won't prevent future energy shortages and won't save us money,&quot; said Carl

Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;Poll after poll shows that

Americans disapprove of the Bush Administration's energy policies.  Our

members on the ground are telling the Administration we should be pursuing

energy efficiency, renewable energy, and cleaner and more responsible

fuels.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sierra Club activists will respond to Administration's events today in the

following cities:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philadelphia, PA--While Vice President Cheney gives a closed-door address

to the National Association of Counties, Sierra Club activists will hold a

press conference at 2 PM outside the meeting to stress how the Bush energy

plan would exacerbate air pollution problems in Pennsylvania. Volunteers

will also distribute leaflets and collect petition signatures in downtown

Philadelphia that afternoon. Contact Nancy Rauch, 215-668-5377</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pittsburgh, PA--While Vice President Cheney presides over an

invitation-only &quot;town hall meeting&quot; Sierra Club volunteers and coalition

partners will protest  at the free speech area at Alleghany Community

College Boise Campus in Monroeville.  Sierra Club representatives will also

hold a press conference at 11 AM in downtown Pittsburgh focusing on air

pollution problems in Western Pennsylvania and unveiling TV ads which will

run on Pittsburgh news programs on Monday.  Contact Peter Wray,

412-244-9907</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sioux Falls, SD--Sierra Club volunteers will attend a town hall meeting

hosted by Interior Secretary Gayle Norton to ask her tough questions on the

Administration's energy policy. Club activists and environmental allies

will hold a press conference immediately after the town hall meeting to

criticize the Administration's policies of drilling for oil in pristine

places, such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  Contact Tracie Weber,

605-366-2912</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chicago, IL--Sierra Club representatives will hold a  rally nearby the
