- February 28 - Bipartisan legislation to

designate as wilderness the coastal plain of the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge introduced today in both the House and Senate

"preserves one of the wildest places left on the planet, and launches

a powerful response to those who would sacrifice it for a dribble of

oil" according to Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of

Wildlife.

<p>The bill will be introduced in the House by Reps. Edward Markey

(D-Mass.) and Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) with more than 100 co-sponsors,

and in the Senate by Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) with at least

19

co-sponsors. The legislation would add the 1.5 million acres of the

coastal plain to existing wilderness in the refuge, protecting what

scientists have described as "the biological heart of the refuge."

<p>"Representatives Markey and Johnson, Senator Lieberman, and all of

their co-sponsors want to give Americans a priceless gift for future

generations. Polls unanimously indicate that the American public

opposes sacrificing America's Serengeti for six month's worth of oil.

We believe this public support will enable us to not only stop the

current push for drilling but, ultimately, provide permanent

protection for this irreplaceable national treasure," said

Schlickeisen.

<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was created by President

Eisenhower in 1960. Congress added significantly to the refuge in

1980 and conferred wilderness designation on most of it. Although

President Jimmy Carter strongly supported it, the 1980 legislation

did not designate the coastal plain of the refuge, sometimes referred

to as the "1002 Area," as wilderness. This bill will complete the

protection of the refuge as wilderness.

<p>According to Schlickeisen, the coastal plain of the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge is used year-round by a variety of wildlife,

and is irreplaceable habitat for many of these species. In spring,

130,000 caribou migrate to the coast to calve and raise their young.

In winter, the area is important for female polar bears, which make

ice dens along the coast to give birth to their cubs. Migratory

birds from every one of the lower-48 states return to the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge every year to nest.

<p>Scientists overwhelmingly agree that oil activities would

devastate this unique ecosystem. Only 60 miles west of the Arctic

Refuge at Prudhoe Bay and adjacent fields, oil development sprawls

more than 1,000 square miles. According to Alaska's Department of

Environmental Conservation, there are 55 contaminated waste sites

already associated with this development and an average of 400 spills

each year. Just last week, BP-Amoco's Prudhoe Bay facilities

reported spills totaling 5,000 to 9,700 gallons in two major

incidents.

<p>In January, Defenders of Wildlife launched a campaign to protect

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil development, featuring

an innovative computer animation and an Internet-based petition

drive, all at the web site <a href="http://www.SaveArcticRefuge.org">www.SaveArcticRefuge.org.</a>

Visitors to the

site can send messages urging protection of the refuge to the White

House, their senators, and their member of congress. Schlickeisen

noted that the flow of e-mails from this petition has been so heavy

that the White House computer system has been overwhelmed and many

messages have had to be returned. Schlickeisen said that Defenders

will deliver these by hand. To date, Defenders has forwarded more

than 700,000 of these e-mail messages to policy makers, making this

what appears to be the largest Internet petition campaign ever.
