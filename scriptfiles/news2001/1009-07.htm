- October 9 - Two hybrid cars top the new Model Year 2002 Fuel Economy

Guide, with a fleet of gas-guzzling light-trucks bringing up the rear.  The

government's annual report, released today, catalogues the parking-lot full

of hyper-guzzling SUVs automakers are building, with two super-efficient

hybrid cars leading a new direction for American drivers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The winners for 2002 are the gasoline-electric hybrids -- the 64 mpg Honda

Insight and the 48 mpg Toyota Prius, which top the chart,&quot; said Ann

Mesnikoff, Washington Representative of Sierra Club's Global Warming and

Energy Program.  &quot;The big losers are the monstrous SUVs, like the Ford

Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade which guzzle 14 mpg or

less.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans have long wanted to reduce our dependence on oil,&quot; Mesnikoff

continued.  &quot;We know that automakers have the capability to stop making

gas-guzzlers and can give Americans what they want:  cars and SUV's that go

further on a gallon of gas.  It's time they started.  Today's SUV's will be

on the road for 10 years or more, driving up our need for oil with every

mile.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Published by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection

Agency, the report provides consumers with fuel economy information on

every 2002 car and light truck.  If recent trends continue, Americans can

expect nearly half of all vehicles sold in 2002 to be SUVs and other light

trucks.  The fuel economy of 2001 vehicles continued a downward spiral,

plummeting to the lowest point since 1980, according to the 2001 Light Duty

Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends Report, issued by the EPA

last week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report provides consumers with information on individual cars and

trucks, but when you add it up we get increasing demand for oil,&quot;

Mesnikoff added.  &quot;We are dismayed that in 2002 the auto industry is

offering consumers light trucks with an average fuel economy virtually the

same as those sold in 1980.  Gas guzzling costs drivers money at the pump,

drives up global warming pollution and keeps America dependent on oil.  The

auto industry should put technology to work so Americans can reduce our oil

dependence, spend less at the pump and curb global warming.&quot;</font></p>
