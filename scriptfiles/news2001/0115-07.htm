<P><B>Mid-1990s</B>

<BR>Southern Partisan sells T-shirts celebrating the Lincoln assassination with 

a quote from John Wilkes Booth ("Sic Semper Tyrannis") on the front, and 

Jefferson's quote about liberty requiring "the blood of patriots and 

tyrants" on the back.



<P><B>April 19, 1995</B>

<BR>Timothy McVeigh is arrested after bombing the Oklahoma City federal 

building, wearing a T-shirt identical to the one sold by Southern Partisan. 

(Front and back views of the Southern Partisan shirt can be seen at 

<A HREF="http://www.fair.org/sp-shirt.html">www.fair.org/sp-shirt.html</A>)



<P><B>December 1995</B>

<BR>Southern Partisan General Store sends out form letter stating: "Due to a 

surprising demand for our anti-Lincoln T-shirt, our stock has been reduced 

to odd sizes. If the enclosed shirt will not suffice, we will be glad to 

refund your money or immediately ship you another equally militant shirt 

from our catalog."



<P><B>April 24, 1997</B>

<BR>In his opening statement on day one of McVeigh's murder and conspiracy 

trial, the prosecutor described the T-shirt worn by McVeigh at the time of 

his arrest, as reported by the New York Times (4/25/97): It "showed the 

tree of liberty, with droplets of bright red blood where the fruit should 

be, and the slogan 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time 

with the blood of patriots and tyrants.' [The quotation is from a 1787 

letter by Thomas Jefferson to Williams Stevens Smith.] On the front was a 

picture of Lincoln, emblazoned with the Latin slogan 'Sic Semper Tyrannis' 

[thus always to tyrants], shouted by his assassin, John Wilkes Booth."
