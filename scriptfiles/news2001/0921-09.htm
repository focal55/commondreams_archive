<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - September 21 - The Public Health Association of New York City (PHANYC) and the

American Public Health Association (APHA) join the nation in

grieving over the devastating loss of life that occurred during

last week's terrorist attacks. We extend our deepest sympathies to

those who are mourning immeasurable losses from this tragedy.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, we honor the firefighters, police, emergency

medical technicians, physicians, nurses, public health workers and

others who have worked so courageously and tirelessly in the rescue

operations. Many of them are working still. Tragically, many have

perished in the rescue effort. PHANYC and APHA will do everything

in our power to help provide services to protect and promote the

mental and physical health of victims, rescuers, their families and

others in our communities who have been affected by the terrorist

attacks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In no uncertain terms, PHANYC and APHA emphatically condemn all

acts of terrorism -- horrible acts that can wound and destroy not

only the lives of individuals but also community well-being and

public health. Amidst the widespread fear and anger that these

attacks have engendered, we urge public health workers throughout

the United States to work to prevent responses of bias, hatred,

vengeance and violence in our communities.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, we have already witnessed a rising wave of such

incidents across the United States. As the New York Times reported

on September 19, people who look Middle-Eastern and South Asian,

whatever their religion or nation of origin, have been singled out

for harassment. A Sikh gasoline station owner, an Egyptian

Christian grocer and a Pakistani Muslim storekeeper have been shot.

Mosques have been fired upon and Arab-owned businesses have been

burned. The Arab-American Family Support Center in Brooklyn

reported: "We have kids scared to go to school, mothers too scared

to leave their homes to buy food for their families. Arab-American

children reported this afternoon that teachers have attacked them

verbally. There are now four reported attacks in Bay Ridge.

Families are contacting us because they are too scared too talk to

the American police." These acts of bias and violence must stop.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHANYC and APHA also urge public health workers throughout the

United States to insist that all branches of government prevent

erosion of civil liberties during this difficult time. Case in

point: Within a week of the terrorist attacks, the U.S. Justice

Department announced a major expansion of its power to detain

immigrants suspected of crimes, including new rules that would

allow legal immigrants to be detained indefinitely during a

national emergency. As the American Civil Liberties Union stated,

"a free and open society is vulnerable to mass destruction and

terror. But this terrible vulnerability is part of the strength of

such a society, not a hallmark of its weakness. It takes courage

to allow the free movement of people and ideas."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, as public health organizations, we are deeply concerned

by the rising calls for war. As President Jimmy Carter wrote in

his foreword to War and Public Health, published by APHA and Oxford

University Press, "War and militarism have catastrophic effects on

human health and well-being. These effects include casualties

during war, long-lasting physical and psychological effects on

noncombatant adults and children, the reduction of human and

financial resources available to meet social needs, and the

creation of a climate in which violence is a primary mode of

dealing with conflict."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PHANYC and APHA call for national policies that demand

punishment, under international law, of the perpetrators of

violence. We urge public health workers to support the

renunciation of use of force for vengeance and war against

populations. In addition, we call for local, national and

international policies to alleviate social and economic

disparities, health disparities, injustices and violations of human

rights that contribute to hatred, conflict and violence.</font>
