- February 7 - More than a ton of StarLink corn dumped at 

EPA headquarters today provided a welcome mat for Christine 

Todd Whitman, just starting her new job as head of the agency, 

and a reminder of the genetic food fight that is waiting her attention. A

dozen Greenpeace activists dressed in biohazard suits and holding a banner

reading, "Genetic Experiment — Whitman: StarLink Corn Isn’t Food!," piled

the gene-altered corn in the Environmental Protection Agency’s driveway to

underscore the group's demands that the agency not grant approval the animal feed

crop for use as human food. Scientists have warned that the altered corn could

trigger dangerous allergies in some people, with children at greatest

risk.  

<p>

In a move that signals a continuing revolving door between 

regulators and the biotech industry, Whitman is expected to name 

former Monsanto executive Linda Fisher as Deputy Administrator of 

EPA, according to today's <i>Washington Post</i>. Fisher is just the 

latest genetic engineering crony to be added to the Bush 

administration, which already includes at least four others with ties to

Monsanto. 

</p>

<p>

"The Bush Administration is shamelessly handing over our food to 

the gene giants," said Charles Margulis, Greenpeace Genetic 

Engineering Specialist. "Christy Whitman is known for favoring dirty

industries over scientific precaution, and with Monsanto attached at her

hip, we're sure to see more genetic food pollution."

</p>

<p>

The American Chemical Council (ACC), a trade group that includes 

the major producers of engineered crops, has already reacted 

warmly to the Whitman's appointment. According to Chemical 

Week, ACA President Fred Webber "is optimistic about the 

appointment given Whitman's record in New Jersey." Even before 

her confirmation as the new EPA chief, Whitman called Webber to 

express her desire to work together with the industry. 

</p>

<p>

ACC has good reason to be optimistic. The former New Jersey 

Governor has a reputation, even among her own agency staff, for 

being soft on polluters. According to a 1997 survey of over 700 New 

Jersey Department of Environmental Quality staffers, enforcement 

of environmental laws under Whitman was marred by "excessive 

corporate influence and manipulation of scientific findings." The 

survey, conducted by Public Employees for Environmental 

Responsibility (PEER), found that more than half of the 

environmental staffers felt that "scientific evaluations are influenced by

political considerations" under Whitman.  

</p>

<p>

Since last fall, <a href="00_10_19text.htm" target="page">nearly 300 food products have been contaminated</a> 

with StarLink corn. EPA approved StarLink only for animal feed, 

and required Aventis, the developer of the corn, to insure that the 

corn is used only for feed. EPA officials have stated that Aventis 

illegally allowed StarLink to contaminate the food supply, but the 

agency has never indicated that it would enforce its rules against 

the company. 

</p>

<p>

"Christy Whitman has been cozying up to the chemical and 

biotech industries while environmentalists and consumers are left 

holding the feed bag," said Margulis. "Wealthy companies should 

not be granted pardons, they should be held accountable for 

polluting our food."
