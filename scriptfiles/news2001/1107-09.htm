WASHINGTON - November 7 - The Conservation Action 

Network (<a href="http://takeaction.worldwildlife.org/" target="_new">http://takeaction.worldwildlife.org/</a>), an online advocacy 

tool sponsored by World Wildlife Fund, allows everyone, worldwide, 

the opportunity to protect the Earth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Conservation Action Network is a free service for 

individuals from around the world who share a common interest in 

advancing legislation, policies and programs aimed at maintaining 

the stability of the planet. Originally created in 1997, the site 

was recently redesigned to make voicing your opinion easier -- and 

more effective. Currently, over 34,000 people are enrolled in the 

network. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We developed the network to give voice to people who want to 

protect the environment. The Conservation Action Network increases 

people's ability to express themselves and get conservation 

results,&quot; said WWF Executive Vice President David Sandalow. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activists have used the network to help: 

-- Stop the Russians from commercial hunting of beluga whales 

-- Pass legislation to protect the Galapagos Islands 

-- Secure adequate funding for large-scale restoration of the 

Florida Everglades 

-- Enact the Rhino and Tiger Labeling bill, which has strengthened 

protection of endangered tigers and rhinos </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visitors to the site will find various ongoing campaigns with 

brief explanations regarding the issues as well as links to more 

information. Friendlier functionality allows visitors to send a 

prepared letter, written specifically for each action campaign, to 

their respective senator, congressional representative or other 

decision makers. Enrolled visitors may send an edited version 

reflecting their own concerns and may choose to print the letter 

and send it directly via postal mail. Dynamic new features also 

allow enrolled visitors to track action campaigns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Activists frequently tell us how thrilled they are to be able 

to stay informed about, and weigh in on, breaking conservation 

issues. They love being part of something big and of a team that 

gets results,&quot; Debra Prybyla, coordinator for Conservation Action 

Network said. </font></p>

network and to enroll. </font></p>
