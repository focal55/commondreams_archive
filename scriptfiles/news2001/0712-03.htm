- July 12 - Responding to reports

that Bush administration national missile defense plans will

come into conflict with a 1972 treaty with Moscow "in months,"

experts from Washington and London-based nuclear arms control

organizations warned that such a proposal would be vigorously

opposed at home and abroad. They charged that it would decrease

rather than increase national and international security because

a crash NMD deployment will not provide an effective and

reliable defense against long-range missile attack and will

precipitate a counterproductive and unnecessary showdown with

European allies, as well as Russia and China.

<p>"The Bush administration is seeking to deploy a rudimentary

missile defense by 2004 under the pretense of a new testing

program in Alaska. Such a crash deployment would provide only

the illusion of protection from potential long-range missile

threats, while at the same time it would violate the

Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and set off a dangerous

action reaction cycle, involving the United States, Russia, and

China," said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the

Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers.

<p>"Abrogating the ABM Treaty against the objections of most

Europeans makes a mockery of President Bush's pledge to

'consult' with allies and with Russia on the missile defense

issue. Consultation should be a two-way process, as our security

will be adversely affected if the United States breaks its

treaty commitments " added Rebecca Johnson of the London-based

journal, Disarmament Diplomacy.

<p>"The true purpose of the Bush plan seems to be to shoot down

the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty rather than incoming ballistic

missiles. We urge Congressional leaders -- Democrats and

Republicans -- to block this ill-advised decision,'" said John

Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World. "National

missile defense remains a costly and counterproductive shield of

dreams," he added.

<p>The Bush Administration's fiscal 2002 defense budget request

proposes a substantial increase in spending on missile defenses.

The Bush budget calls for fifty-seven percent more spending on

missile defense, from $5.3 billion in fiscal 2001, to a proposed

$8.3 billion for fiscal 2002. The chairman of the Senate Armed

Services Committee, Carl Levin (D-Mich.), has said he would seek

to block funding for activities that would unilaterally abrogate

U.S. treaty commitments.

<p>The fiscal 2002 DoD budget request includes funds for a new

anti-missile "test bed" in Alaska, which could be made

operational in the event of an "emergency," according to the

Bush administration. Construction will begin in August and a

violation of the ABM Treaty could occur some months after.

<p>The ABM Treaty allows for agreement on additional national

missile defense test sites unless such test sites constitute

de-facto deployment of national anti-missile capabilities, which

is the intention of the Bush scheme. The Associated Press

reports that an unnamed Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson

responded by saying: "We will view the first cubic meter of

concrete laid under the launching pad for interceptor missiles

in Alaska as the United States' formal withdrawal from the ABM

Treaty."

<p>"There is no quick, easy or cheap national missile defense

technology," said Lisbeth Gronlund, staff scientist for the

Union of Concerned Scientists.

<p>"The plan outlined by the Pentagon would provide very little

protection should an attack occur. Even if the interceptor and

kill vehicle technology worked to some level of effectiveness by

2004-2005, the system would use existing and relatively

inadequate radars that would have very little capability to

discriminate the warhead from other objects, including debris or

simple decoys. Thus, it could be fooled by very simple

countermeasures," said Gronlund.

<p>At least 20 or more flight intercept tests, plus hundreds of

component and subsystem tests will be needed before the Pentagon

will be ready to attempt realistic operational testing of such

an NMD system, according to the June 2001 report entitled, "NMD

Development is Not Hostage to the ABM Treaty," written by Phil

Coyle, former head of DoD's Operational Test &amp; Evaluation and

currently at the Center for Defense Information. (See

<a href="http://www.cdi.org/dm/2001/" target="new">http://www.cdi.org/dm/2001/.)</a>

<p>"The ABM Treaty remains important to arms control as well as

nuclear nonproliferation because it promotes stability and

facilitates offensive nuclear weapons reductions. We must work

with Russia, China, and others to accomplish our global security

goals and not act unilaterally," added John Rhinelander, the

former U.S. legal advisor for the Nixon Administration's ABM

Treaty negotiation team.

<p>"Rather than rush toward deployment of an unproven NMD

system, President Bush should redouble efforts to secure nuclear

material in the former Soviet Union, pursue deep, verifiable,

U.S. and Russian nuclear arms reductions, elimination of

dangerous, Cold War launchonwarning and targeting plans, and

pursue a comprehensive nuclear proliferation effort, including

the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and a verifiable

freeze of North Korea's ballistic missile program," concluded

Kimball.

<p><i>The Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers is a non-partisan

alliance of 14 national nuclear non-proliferation organizations

dedicated to the pursuit of a practical, step-by-step program to

address the threat of nuclear weapons. For further information
