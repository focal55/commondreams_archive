- October 29  - The World Bank has invested over $20 billion 

        in more than 200 projects that extract, transport, or burn fossil fuels 

        since 1992, according to a first-of-its-kind global database launched 

        today by the Institute for Policy Studies.

<p>This new resource for journalists, researchers and observers of international 

        finance and energy policy comes on the eve of two major events related 

        to the ongoing debate on climate change: the global climate negotiations 

        beginning on October 29, 2001, in Marrakech, and the World Bank's new 

        Extractive Industries Review beginning also on October 29 in Brussels.</p>

      <p>The Institute for Policy Studies' (IPS) online database, available at 

        www.seen.org, catalogues all World Bank-financed fossil fuel projects 

        on a map-based database, together with each project's anticipated lifetime 

        greenhouse gas emissions. IPS found that the sum of lifetime emissions 

        from World Bank projects financed from 1992 to the present will exceed 

        40 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a figure almost two times that of all 

        global emissions from burning or flaring fossil fuels in 1998. </p>

      <p>&quot;At a time when global leaders are doing all they can to stop the 

        potentially catastrophic effects of global warming, this database demonstrates 

        that the World Bank's fossil fuel investments are contributing to the 

        problem in a big way,&quot; said Daphne Wysham of the Sustainable Energy 

        and Economy Network (SEEN), a project of IPS.</p>

      <p>The World Bank is home to the key institution created during the Climate 

        Convention at the 1992 Earth Summit, the Global Environmental Facility 

        (GEF), which is charged with the task of financing alternative energy 

        and energy efficiency projects. However, over the same time period, IPS 

        research found that the World Bank and the GEF, together, have invested 

        barely $1billion on a few dozen energy efficiency and renewable energy 

        initiatives. Fossil fuels, some World Bank staffers claim, are essential 

        building blocks in development. However, experience in the field and even 

        the Bank's own internal studies suggest the exact opposite: overweening 

        emphasis on fossil fuel investments has actually hampered progress in 

        many developing countries, and often results in the impoverishment of 

        the very people the Bank is intended to serve.</p>

      <p>&quot;From the local level, where fossil fuels extraction results in 

        resettlement, civil unrest and environmental degradation, to the global 

        level, where these fossil fuels lead to global warming, investment in 

        oil, gas and coal is destabilizing for all of us,&quot; said Wysham.</p>

      <p>The IPS global database follows previous SEEN reports that covered World 

        Bank financing from 1992 to 1997, and from 1997 to 1998. In response to 

        SEEN research, which catalyzed parliamentary hearings in Europe on World 

        Bank fossil fuel investments, World Bank President James Wolfensohn pledged 

        at the Earth Summit+5 in New York in 1997 to calculate greenhouse gas 

        emissions for World Bank energy projects, and &quot;where there is cause 

        for concern, explore more climate-friendly options.&quot; However, that 

        pledge has proven hollow, as World Bank fossil fuel lending has remained 

        constant at over $2 billion per year.</p>

      <p>Growing worldwide criticism of the World Bank's fossil fuel investments 

        has prompted the Bank to undertake a major, year-long review of its oil, 

        gas, and mining projects, to be launched October 29 in Brussels (see www.eireview.org).</p>

      <p>&quot;The World Bank's proposed review of its extractive industries should 

        begin with a recognition that there is a body of evidence that suggests 

        fossil fuel lending is bad for development, the environment, and human 

        rights&quot; said Steve Kretzmann, SEEN Campaign Coordinator. &quot;The 

        Bank must face the fact that lending for fossil fuels runs directly counter 

        to its stated goals of poverty alleviation and sustainable development,&quot; 

        Kretzmann added.<br>

<p>SEEN has also reported on the fossil fuel finances of other institutions, 

        including U.S. institutions (Overseas Private Investment Corporation and 

        Export-Import Bank) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
