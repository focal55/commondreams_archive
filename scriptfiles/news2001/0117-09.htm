- January 17 -  The rights of American consumers to know what 

they are eating and feeding their families was today denied them by 

the Food and Drug Administration. The new FDA policy proposal, 

posted  on the web today, does not require labeling or any pre-

market safety testing of genetically engineered foods. Instead, FDA 

has sided with the biotech industry, which vehemently fights 

mandatory labeling of gene-altered food.

<p>

"This is a terrible day for American consumers—the government 

has failed to protect their health and their interests," said Kimberly 

Wilson, a Greenpeace Genetic Engineering Campaigner in San 

Francisco. "While the rest of the world is moving to label genetic 

foods, U.S. consumers are still denied free choice in the grocery 

store. Americans deserve to know what's in their food, yet FDA is 

working with industry to keep genetic engineering a secret 

ingredient." Last week, a report by the Consumer Federation of 

America echoed Greenpeace's calls for mandatory labeling of all 

genetically engineered food.  

</p>

<p>

Labeling of genetically engineered foods is required throughout 

Europe, and in Japan, Russia, Australia, New Zealand and other 

countries.  

</p>

<p>

Food makers do not have to inform consumers if their products 

contain genetically engineered ingredients under the new FDA 

policy.  FDA will allow gene-altered foods on the market without long-

term safety tests for effects in the diet or the environment.  

</p>

<p>

A new Greenpeace report, Genetically Engineered Food: Still 

Unlabeled and Untested, has found that only three health studies on 

genetically engineered foods have been published in peer-reviewed 

journals. None of these met scientists' recommendations that gene 

altered foods be tested for 90 days, nor did they meet the FDA's 

own testing requirements for food additives that would require, in 

some cases, up to two years multiple feeding studies. The biotech 

company studies that FDA relies on to assess new altered crops are 

generally not submitted for peer review and not available for public 

scrutiny.  

</p>

<p>

Doctors and scientists warn that genetically engineered foods could 

trigger allergies, have increased levels of toxins, or could hasten the 

spread of antibiotic resistance. The medical journal the Lancet has 

stated: "It is astounding that FDA has not changed their stance on 

genetically modified food…. Governments should never have allowed 

these products into the food chain without insisting on rigorous 

testing for effects on health."  

</p>

<p>

Last fall, Greenpeace released the True Food Shopping List, a 

detailed report of thousands of foods made with genetically 

engineered ingredients. "FDA has refused to require labels, so 

Greenpeace took action," added Wilson. "We labeled genetically 

engineered food to give consumers a fighting chance when they go 

to the store."
