- September 28 - The D.C. Statehood Green

Party will welcome and host Green Party members

from all over the United States this weekend as

they arrive in Washington, D.C. to participate in

various rallies, workshops, forums, and other

events addressing the September 11 terrorist

attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon, and

airline flights and the U.S. response to the

attacks.  The planned events replace protests

earlier scheduled against the IMF and World Bank

summits, which were canceled after the attacks. 



<p>Officials and organizers of the Green Party of

the United States, including Steering Committee

members Anita Rios and Ben Manski, political

coordinator Dean Myerson (cell phone

for interview this weekend.  Call them directly,

or call 202-518-5624, to arrange an interview.



<p>The following major Green Party events are open

to the media:

refreshments and music, hosted by the D.C.

Statehood Green Party for Greens and friends

coming to Washington, D.C. for the weekend's

Butler Parks Center, 2437 15th Street, NW. 

Interviews with Green Party members, officials,

and activists may take place during the Welcome

Wagon.

Forum: A Democratic Response to the Crisis.  9:00

a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at the University of the

<p>D.C. Statehood Green Party members and other

Greens will also participate in numerous other

events throughout the weekend, including a Peace

March on Sunday, September 30 organized by the

Washington Peace Center and many other groups

that will commence 11 a.m. at Malcolm X Park,

16th and Euclid Streets, NW.  (More information:

202-234-2000,

<p>"Greens everywhere have called for peace with

justice," said D.C. Statehood Green Party media

coordinator Scott McLarty, who also co-chairs the

media committee of the Green Party of the United

States. 



<p>"That means we seek justice for the attacks, with

the perpetrators apprehended, tried, and punished

through an internationally cooperative effort --

and that the U.S. must not launch vengeful,

retaliatory military strikes that will kill more

civilians, lose sympathy for the U.S., and

motivate further terrorism.  We must do

everything possible to avert war and to prevent

the further shedding of innocent blood.  Let's

not give the extremists the holy war they seek."



<p>"We also call on President Bush and other leaders

to continue condemning the racist backlash

against Arabs, Muslims, and all people of Middle

Eastern ethnicity or ancestry, and we warn

against the erosion of civil liberties at a time

when democracy, free and open discussion,

political dissent, and scrutiny of U.S. policy

are most precious and necessary." 



<p>Greens have also said that preventing future

attacks will depend in part on resolving various

conflicts in the Middle East, including an end to

Israel's suppression of the human rights of

Palestinians, ceasing the sanctions and

destruction of infrastructure that have killed

hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, and assisting

the plight of civilian Afghanis living under

extreme economic hardship and a brutally

oppressive theocracy.
