- November 19 - As Congress heads for a one-week

recess, Green Party officials issued a blunt warning

to six congressional incumbents today, promising that

Green Party challengers will run aggressive campaigns

against them based upon their support for Fast Track

legislation currently before Congress.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Green Party congressional candidates will fight to

defend American sovereignty against anti-democratic

trade pacts, and we will campaign to hold

congressional incumbents accountable for their

betrayal of working people and the environment,&quot; said

Ben Manski, Co-Chair of the Green Party of the United

States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party released a list of six targeted

Democratic and Republican members of Congress against

whom they intend to run serious challenges:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REPRESENTATIVE BOB CLEMENT (D-TN, 5) - Rep. Clement

faces a growing challenge from mathematics professor

Dr. Jonathan D. Farley, of Vanderbilt University in

Nashville. Dr. Farley, an advocate of reparations for

slavery and segregation, is a rising star who has been

featured recently in Essence Magazine, the hip-hop

magazine The Source, and Ebony as a &quot;Leader of the

Future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;My opponent is a favorite of the corporate lobby, and

they are counting on him to deliver on Fast Track.

But, thanks to pressure from the Greens, he may oppose

it,&quot; said Dr. Farley. &quot;If he doesn't, come next

November, Congressman 'Inclement' may just get

down-sized.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REPRESENTATIVE NORM DICKS (D-WA, 3); REPRESENTATIVE

ADAM SMITH (D-WA, 9) - Prominent Greens in Washington

state, frustrated with the unresponsiveness of

Representative Dicks and Smith both to respectful

appeals and to picketing by Greens and labor activists

regarding their respective trade stances, have made a

public appeal for candidates to challenge them. Rep.

Dicks is considered a leaning &quot;yes&quot; vote on Fast Track

and Rep. Smith is considered to be on the fence; both

are considered vulnerable in their reelection bids. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Washington Greens have reason to expect success: Last

year, Green Party candidate Joe Szwaja won 20% of the

vote in his challenge of Rep. Jim McDermott, and

political observers have noted McDermott's recent

leadership in questioning the bombing of Afghanistan

and fighting the passage of Fast Track.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our message to Representatives Dicks and Smith is

crystal clear: You won't be able to take the

progressive vote for granted, we're going to speak for

the interests of workers, consumers, and nature, and

we will define the issues in this campaign,&quot; said

Szwaja, the most successful Green Party candidate for

federal office thus far in the United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REPRESENTATIVE GERALD KLECZKA (D-WI, 4) - Greater

Milwaukee Green Party member Brian Merrill Vasquez

Verdin has announced an anti-war pro-democracy

campaign for the Green Party nomination for Congress.

Verdin is a member of the International Association of

Machinists union (IAM) with deep roots in the labor

movement and Milwaukee's Latino community. Verdin

expects to face incumbent Rep. Kleczka after

redistricting next year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I want to join Barbara Lee. I want to be one more

congressperson who will stand with Barbara Lee and say

'Hell No!' to war, Fast Track, and corporate

profiteering,&quot; said Verdin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REPRESENTATIVE MARK GREEN (R-WI, 8) - Rep. Green can

soon expect to face a serious Green Party challenger

in northeast Wisconsin, as his likely opponent will

announce her candidacy within weeks. The Wisconsin

Green Party has committed to the 8th District race.

Green is currently considered to be a fence-sitter on

Fast Track.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REPRESENTATIVE RON KIND (D-WI, 3) - Rep. Kind has

angered western Wisconsin dairy farmers and

steelworkers with his past voting record on trade

issues, and is considered vulnerable in this

independent-minded district that gave the Nader/LaDuke

ticket its best percentages in 2000. Kind is

considered to be leaning in favor of a 'yes' vote on

Fast Track even though thousands of workers in his

district have lost their jobs at La Crosse Boot,

Heileman Brewery, Rayovac, Lands End, and other

factories due to trade-related job exports. The

Wisconsin Green Party is actively recruiting

candidates in the 3rd District and is committed to the

race. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The above races are against congressional incumbents

considered key to the upcoming Fast Track vote. Greens

also have declared their candidacies for Congress in

Arkansas (2nd), California (41st), and Nevada (1st),

and are gearing up to run serious campaigns in

hundreds of other congressional and statewide races

next year. Over 275 Greens vied for federal, state,

and local office in 2001, and at least 52 of these won

election.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H.R. 3005 would grant Fast Track trade negotiation

powers to the President and represents a substantial

transfer of Congress' constitutionally-mandated

authority over trade to the executive branch. Greens

join with the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, Friends of the

Earth, Public Citizen, and hundreds of other unions,

civil rights, environmental, student, farm, and

democracy groups in strongly opposing the bill. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens generally oppose the establishment of trade

agreements which undermine democracy and erode

environmental, labor, and civil rights protections.

Greens specifically oppose the granting of

Presidential Fast Track authority because of the

perception that the Presidency is insensitive to

citizen concerns about trade policy.</font></p>
