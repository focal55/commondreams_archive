statement by Defenders of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen 

on General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation of Cheney 

Energy Group: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's statement by the Government Accounting Office 

reinforces what has been suspected for months -- that the White 

House's energy plan is at its heart the product of a backroom 

deal between the Bush administration and their pals in the oil 

and gas industries. It has long been strongly rumored that major 

parts of the Bush energy plan were written by industry and given 

to the Vice President's energy task force in White House 

meetings last Spring. The White House has acknowledged that the 

meetings took place but insists upon keeping secret whom they 

met with and what they discussed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The White House is claiming that it's none of the public's 

business how it came up with this plan. To the contrary. The 

only ones to whom such a revelation would likely be damaging is 

the President and Vice President. They weren't so tight-lipped 

after they allowed a handful of environmental leaders to give 

their views after the Vice President's energy policy report was 

completed and the day before it was made public. Instead they 

ran quickly to the media to tell all, in what in retrospect was 

a transparent attempt to fool the public into thinking that the 

White House was seriously listening to the environmental 

community's views. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Clearly the public interest can now best be served by the 

White House revealing everything related to their secret 

meetings with oil industry representatives. We call upon the 

White House to lift the veil of secrecy and publicly announce 

when the meetings took place, who attended, and what industry 

recommended. The public can then compare the recommendations 

with the President's energy proposals and judge for itself the 

extent to which those proposals simply reflect requests from the 

President's and Vice President's industry pals. If the White 

House continues to deny the public's interest in this 

information and to insist that the information remain secret, we 

call upon the Government Accounting Office to protect the 

public's right to know by filing suit to force the White House 

to reveal all.&quot; </font></p>
