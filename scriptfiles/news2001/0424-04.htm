- April 24 - Citing philosophical opposition to &quot;the taking

of human life&quot; and &quot;devaluation of human life in our

society,&quot; Mary Ellen McNish, general secretary of The American

Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and Donald Gann, chairperson

of the Board of Directors, today came out in written opposition

to both the death penalty and the upcoming federal execution of

convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

<P>

&quot;In declaring certain human beings absolutely worthless and

unfit even to live, our government is officially embracing, legitimizing

and acting upon the very sentiments that lead to the occurrence

of violence in the first place,&quot; McNish said in <a href="http://www.afsc.org/news/2001/stmcveh.htm">the prepared

statement</a>. She went on to say that the McVeigh execution will

&quot;serve only to perpetuate the continued devaluation of human

life in our society&quot; and called upon all people to embrace

each other as children of God.

<P>

The American Friends Service Committee has a long history of opposition

to the death penalty having worked more than fifty years to rid

the criminal justice system of systemic injustice and to increase

awareness about those inequities. AFSC is a Quaker organization

that is committed to social justice, peace, and humanitarian service,

working in communities throughout the United States and internationally

using the power of love and nonviolent struggle to bring about

positive social change.

<P>

With national headquarters based in Philadelphia, The American

Friends Service Committee has regional offices in Atlanta, Baltimore,

Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Pasadena, California;

and Cambridge, Massachusetts.
