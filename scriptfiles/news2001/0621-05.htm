- June 21 - If government censors get their way at next 

week's United Nations conference on HIV/AIDS, the denial and 

discrimination that have helped spread the disease will continue 

unabated, Human Rights Watch charged today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several government delegations, including those of the United States, 

Egypt, Libya, and the Vatican, are attempting to delete from the draft 

declaration of the U.N. General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS any 

mention of that groups at particularly high risk of HIV infection are 

men having sex with men, sex workers and their clients, and injecting 

drug users and their sex partners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Moral squeamishness shouldn't stand in the way of finding solutions to 

this terrible crisis,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human 

Rights Watch. &quot;At a conference devoted to fighting AIDS, governments 

must not replicate the silence and denial that have driven the spread of 

the disease.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In language agreed to by Canada, Australia, and several Latin American 

and European countries, the draft declaration makes explicit the goal of 

reducing incidence among &quot;men who have sex with men, sex workers,        

         [and] injecting drug users and their sexual partners,&quot; as well 

as prisoners and refugees. The United States proposes striking this list 

and replacing it with the vague and anodyne phrase, &quot;vulnerable 

individuals,&quot; including those engaging in &quot;risky sexual behavior.&quot; The 

Vatican prefers a similarly euphemistic reference to &quot;people who         

        have multiple sex partners.&quot; Egypt suggests substituting the 

judgmental phrase, &quot;homosexuality among men, prostitution, and other 

forms of irresponsible sexual behavior.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;HIV/AIDS is born in large part of discrimination against women, gay 

men, drug users, sex workers, and others whose status has impeded their 

access to services, information, and social support,&quot; said Joanne Csete, 

a public health expert on AIDS at Human Rights Watch. &quot;Pretending that 

these groups don't exist, or reinforcing                 discrimination 

against them, will only accelerate the spread of the epidemic by pushing 

them further underground and out of reach of the services they 

desperately need to contain the disease.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Csete is the author of a report on violations of the rights of AIDS 

orphans in Kenya, to be released next week. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Violation of civil and political rights is the engine that spreads 

HIV/AIDS in many parts of the world. Where women are unable to negotiate 

the terms of their sexual relations, where gay men and sex workers are 

marginalized and excluded from services, and where sexual violence is 

prevalent, HIV/AIDS flourishes. In negotiations earlier this month, the 

United States nonetheless rejected a proposal by the European Union and 

the Rio Group that the declaration adopt a &quot;rights-based approach&quot; to 

combating HIV/AIDS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If governments attempt to fight HIV/AIDS without addressing the rights 

violations that fuel the epidemic and result from it, they will be doing 

only half the job - or less,&quot; said Csete. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft declaration of the AIDS conference was meant to be completed 

in preparatory meetings ending May 25 at which civil society 

organizations were present. However, since then, discussions have 

continued over contentious points in closed-door sessions attended only 

by governments. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The independent voices most likely to highlight the role of human 

rights abuse in the spread of HIV/AIDS have been excluded from these 

deliberations,&quot; said Roth. &quot;Sadly, governments seem determined to shut 

out uncomfortable messages, even at the risk of a less effective 

strategy for fighting this deadly disease.&quot;</font></p>
