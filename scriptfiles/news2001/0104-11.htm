- January 4 -The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued a complaint

charging Wal-Mart Stores Division CEO Tom Coughlin and other

managers with widespread violations of federal law in the period

before a scheduled union representation election at the company's

Kingman, Arizona store. The federal complaint contends Coughlin and

the other managers "interfered with, restrained, or coerced, and is

continuing to interfere with, restrain or coerce" employees in

violation of federal law.

<p>A majority of the 18 associates working in the Tire and Lube

Express at the Kingman, Arizona Wal-Mart Supercenter signed cards

authorizing the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW)

Local 99R to give them an organized voice on wages, health

benefits, scheduling and working conditions. The UFCW filed a

petition with the NLRB for a secret ballot union representation

election in August, 2000.

<p>Wal-Mart's systematic intimidation and other illegal activities

against its workers forced the union to block the scheduled

election. At that time, company executive Jay Allen claimed that

the union blocked the election "when they knew they would lose."

Actually, the NLRB held up the election pending its investigation

of the union charges, which led to the Board's complaint against

the retail giant.

<p>The complaint cites Wal-Mart for illegal surveillance of its

employees, illegally soliciting complaints from workers, and making

implied promises to remedy problems as a way to dissuade support

for the union. Managers also illegally threatened workers with

loss of benefits such as their store profitability bonus card and

discount card, and made changes to working conditions to discourage

workers from organizing.

<p>"Wal-Mart would rather break the law in order to break its

employees' will to exercise their federal right for a free and fair

voice on the job. Bentonville executives like Tom Coughlin think

they are above the law. Now, the Labor Board is setting the record

straight that Wal-Mart breaks the law and then lies to the public,"

said Mike Leonard, UFCW Director of Strategic Programs.

<p>A spokesperson for the retail giant consistently deflects

questions about employees' efforts to get a voice on the job by

claiming the union is "wasting everybody's time." Since Sam

Walton died, however, employee voices aren't heard in Bentonville,

and his successor have resorted to legal and illegal actions to

delay, discourage, or prevent its employees from gaining a voice.

<p>"Wal-Mart workers want and deserve to earn a living wage that

can support a family with decent health insurance and retirement

security. The UFCW will work as long as it takes to help Wal-Mart

workers reach their dream of a better workplace and a better life.

Wal-Mart insults its employees by insinuating that the desire for

fairness and respect is a waste of time," said Leonard.

<p>A full hearing on the recent NLRB complaint is scheduled for May

1, 2001.

<p>UFCW Local 99R is the largest private sector union in Arizona,

representing more than 15,000 workers at Safeway, Smith's and Fry's

supermarkets. The UFCW is the largest organization of retail

workers in North America, with 1.4 million members. Workers at

retail food industry leaders such as Kroger and Safeway are members

of the UFCW.
