<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 25 - The Green Party of the United

States calls the growing suppression of open debate

about the U.S. response to the September 11 attacks

anti-democratic, anti-American, and unacceptable. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Prudent measures to keep knives off airplanes is one

thing,&quot; said Starlene Rankin, Illinois Green Party

Media Coordinator.  &quot;But allowing the FBI, CIA, or

other police agencies to spy on American citizens is

quite another.  The Greens absolutely oppose any

restriction on civil political dissent.  We must

remain free to question and challenge the political

status quo and to hold our elected officials

accountable -- our cherished civil liberties must not

be compromised!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush says 'either you're with us, or you're

against us' in the war on terrorism -- and calls

anyone who criticizes the U.S.'s unilateral bombing of

Afghanistan or questions the failed U.S. foreign

policies that have alienated people around the world a

supporter of terrorism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One dissenting organization targeted by the FBI is

Women in Black.  An international network of peace

activists founded in 1988, Women in Black has stood in

silent vigil against military attacks and occupations

around the world, often placing themselves in harm's

way.  Women in Black currently hold vigil every

Wednesday evening at the New York Public Library as a

call for peace and in remembrance of those lost to

terrorism on September 11.  In Pennsylvania, the

Lancaster Greens join Women In Black in vigils in

front of the Lancaster County courthouse every

Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Women in Black counts several Green Party activists

among its members, including Annie Goeke, formerly of

the party's national steering committee and now the

chair of the International Committee.  Other groups

under suspicion by the FBI for potential terrorism

include harmless dissident groups like Reclaim the

Streets and Carnival Against Capitalism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How profoundly ironic it is that as we claim to be

defending the freedom for democracy, we are silencing

the voices of women and others that are part of the

growing movement for peace,&quot; said Goeke.  &quot;Our civil

liberties are being threatened when the FBI labels the

international movement Women in Black as a potential

terrorist group and threatens it with a grand jury

investigation.  Only 9 months ago Women in Black was

awarded the U.N. Millennium Peace Award and was

nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Groups like Women in Black are under suspicion

because they protest U.S. policy, while condemning the

September 11 attacks,&quot; said Kara Ceriello, chair of

the Green Party of Washington State.  &quot;But the Bush

Administration won't criticize the drug companies,

such as Bayer, and drug stores that have been

price-gouging and blocking low-cost generic forms of

antibiotics that effectively fight Anthrax.  The White

House won't hold Unocal responsible for past business

deals with the Taliban or discuss American business

interests in an oil pipeline through Afghanistan.  And

the White House won't acknowledge the Northern

Alliance's multi-million-dollar opium crop, a source

of illegal narcotics throughout the West.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Green activists point to groups like the

Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan

(RAWA) as a hope for peace in Afghanistan and the

surrounding region.  RAWA demands that both the

Taliban and the Northern Alliance be disarmed, calling

both sides violent, brutally misogynistic, and

anti-democratic.  RAWA members, active for two

decades, have risked their lives providing secret

education for Afghani girls, providing medical aid for

Afghani women, and documenting the Taliban's

atrocities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The example set by RAWA should be the foundation of a

humane solution to the international crisis,&quot; said Tod

Sloan, social psychologist and co-chair of the

International Committee of the Green Party.  &quot;Greens

call for a response to the September 11 atrocities

that ensures justice for the victims and seeks peace,

stability, and the protection of human rights and

democracy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens across the U.S. continue to protest the

military attacks on Afghanistan, asserting that

violence will not bring a solution to the current

crisis but instead risks escalation of the conflict

into the 'holy war' sought by Osama bin Laden and his

fanatical movement if the attacks continue.  The Green

Party issued a statement in early October calling for

international cooperation in treating the September 11

attacks as a crime against humanity, with the

perpetrators indicted and tried in an ad hoc

international tribunal in accord with treaties such as

1971 Montreal Sabotage Convention, which both the U.S.

and Afghanistan signed.</font></p>
