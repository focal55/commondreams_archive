- April 12 -  While stories of Florida's

hanging and dimpled chads have covered news pages since Election

Day, a new Nation investigation reveals that Florida elections

officials -- including Secretary of State Katherine Harris --

engineered an electoral system that was stacked against black

voters from the start and was in place well before the election.

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.thenation.com/docPrint.mhtml?i=20010430&s=lantigua">investigation</a> by Pulitzer Prize-winning

journalist John Lantigua in the April 30 issue of The Nation,

Florida's black community -- bitterly at odds with Jeb Bush --

mounted a voter registration drive that increased black voter

turnout in November by an astounding 65 percent. In what many in

the black community saw as a direct response to their efforts, the

state took steps that led to the wrongful disenfranchisement of

many current voters and failed to make preparations to accommodate

the huge numbers of new black voters.

<p>"Despite one well-reported incident involving a police

checkpoint near a polling place, disfranchisement 2000-style did

not depend on intimidation," Lantigua writes in The Nation.

"Instead, Florida state elections officials and hired data

crunchers used computers to target thousands of voters, many of

whom were then purged from the voter rolls without reason. And many

thousands more saw their votes thrown out as a result of

error-prone voting machines and poorly designed ballots, the

results of an underfunded and chaotic electoral system."

<p>In all, some 200,000 Floridians were either not permitted to

vote on Election Day or had their ballots discarded and not

counted. A large and disproportionate number were black, according

to The Nation, which has been recognized for its ongoing reporting

on the Florida election debacle.

<p>"The Nation's investigation into the way Florida, under Governor

Jeb Bush, systematically purged the state's voter rolls and denied

tens of thousands of African Americans their right to vote is a

frightening wake-up call for our democracy," according to Nation

Editor Katrina vanden Heuvel. "The revelations in our story cannot

undo the corruption in Florida's election last November, but they

can and should spur reforms that will ensure that 2000 is the last

time that African Americans will be unfairly targeted and denied

their rights in the voting booth in Florida or anywhere in

America."

<p>A pending NAACP lawsuit charges Secretary of State Harris and

other Florida officials with violating the 14th Amendment and the

1965 Voter Rights Act and demands many reforms to the Florida

electoral system. In its March interim assessment, the U.S. Civil

Rights Commission said it had uncovered evidence that is likely to

lead to "findings of probable discrimination."

<p>According to The Nation's investigation:

<p>-- In 1998 and 1999, Florida contracted with two data analysis

firms to purge the voter rolls of felons and other ineligible

voters. (Florida is one of only 14 states in the nation that does

not restore voting rights to felons who have completed their

sentences.) In both cases, the results were error-filled and

targeted blacks in extremely disproportionate number. "I felt like

I was slingshotted back into slavery," Reverend Willie David

Whiting, a black pastor from Tallahassee, said after arriving at

his polling place to find himself listed as a convicted felon and

refused the right to vote despite never having spent a day in jail.

<p>-- Emmett "Bucky" Mitchell IV, the assistant general counsel to

the Florida Division of Elections who headed the purge effort, knew

that the purge lists would include people who were not felons

because of the intentionally loose standards used to draw up the

purge lists. Mitchell justified the standards to The Nation on the

following grounds, "Just as some people might have been removed

from the list who shouldn't have been, some voted who shouldn't

have." In other words, because an ineligible person may have voted

somewhere else, it was acceptable to deny a legitimate voter the

right to vote. Mitchell said this policy was approved by the former

head of the Division of Elections, after consultation with

Secretary of State Harris.

<p>-- More than a year before the election, thousands of complaints

were already coming in from citizens who had been unfairly purged.

Many more wouldn't discover the state's errors until Election Day

when they were not allowed to vote.

<p>-- Florida state officials refused to appropriate $100,000

targeted for voter education that had been requested by county

supervisors -- education that was critical for many of November's

first-time black voters. The lack of informed voters, along with

the lack of sufficient machines and poll workers, contributed to

the chaos on Election Day.

<p>The Nation also details numerous other problems that came to

light after the election, including cases of voters who registered

in plenty of time but were not allowed to vote. The Puerto Rican

Legal Defense and Education Fund documented numerous incidents

where Latino voters were improperly denied the right to vote. The

organization also cited polling places that could not provide

bilingual ballots and had no bilingual poll workers, as required by

law. Furthermore, there were many occasions where Florida electoral

laws were misunderstood by poll workers to the detriment of voters.

<p>Nation contributor Gregory Palast documented Florida's improper

purging of out-of-state felons, whose right to vote had been

automatically restored, in a report in the February 5, 2001 issue

of The Nation, which can be accessed at www.thenation.com.

Subsequently, Florida changed its policy.

<p>John Lantigua shared the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for investigative

reporting for his work at the Miami Herald on voter fraud in the

1997 Miami mayoral race.
