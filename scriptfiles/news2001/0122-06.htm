- January 22 - The New York Times editorial the day after George W. Bush's inauguration (&quot;A

Vision of Unity,&quot; 1/21/01) predicted, based on the inaugural address, thatBush could &quot;lift the nation to a new era of inclusion and social justice,&quot;

and found room to describe how &quot;the gloomy light of a winter's day was

offset by splashes of color like Laura Bush's blue coat.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it didn't find space to mention the most striking feature of the 2001

inauguration: that it occurred amidst widespread and angry protests

rejecting the legitimacy of Bush's claim to office, the likes of which have

not been faced by any modern president.  Along the parade route, he was

confronted by signs with messages like &quot;Shame,&quot; &quot;Bush Lost&quot; and &quot;Hail to the

Thief.&quot; The London Guardian (1/22/01) reported that the inaugural parade&quot;fell well short of being triumphant, and on many occasions during its slow

advance through the drizzle, the sound of jeering drowned out the cheers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the front page of the New York Times showcased stories like &quot;Bush,

Taking Office, Calls for Civility, Compassion and 'Nation of Character';

Unity Is a Theme&quot; and &quot;Proud Father and Son Bask in History's Glow&quot;-- both

of which discussed Bush's teary-eyed father while avoiding any mention of

protesters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the Times' news editors could not totally ignore the estimated 20,000

demonstrators, they did their best to downplay them, placing the one story

about them (&quot;Protesters in the Thousands Sound Off in the Capitol&quot;) on page

17, the sixth out of eight pages of inauguration coverage. This article

featured one quote from Rev. Al Sharpton and one from a demonstrator who

spoke of the &quot;inchoate feeling&quot; that led her to march. This abbreviated

presentation of the viewpoints of the tens of thousands of anti-Bush

protesters was &quot;balanced&quot; by another quote from one of the hundred

anti-abortion activists who demonstrated outside Planned Parenthood's

offices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All told, the story measured 15 column inches out of eight full pages of

inauguration coverage. (It was about three-fourths the length of &quot;Floridians

of the G.O.P. Savor 'Special Victory,' &quot; on page 18.) The accompanying

photo, a tiny 2&quot;x3&quot; shot of one of the day's anti-Bush marches, was the only

one out of 19 inauguration-related photos in the paper to show any sign of

dissent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another inside-pages story, &quot;Echoes of the Past, Near and Far, Are Heard on

the Capital's Streets,&quot; included a lone protester outside the Supreme Court

building, but presented him as well outnumbered by Republican

counter-demonstrators singing &quot;God Bless America.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most telling story of the inauguration package was a front-page news

analysis headlined &quot;Tradition and Legitimacy: A Nation's Old Rituals Begin

to Dissolve Lingering Clouds of a Bitter Election Battle.&quot; This piece, by

R.W. Apple, did mention the demonstrations-- in order to minimize their

significance:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Arguments about the legitimacy of the Texas governor's victory have

persisted even as the country accepted the fact that he had won. Thousands

of the doubtful and disenchanted took to the streets of Washington today in

angry protest. But the debate is likely to grow softer as the nation grows

accustomed to pictures of Mr. Bush speaking from the Oval Office, boarding

Air Force One, accompanied everywhere he goes by the strains of 'Ruffles and

Flourishes' and 'Hail to the Chief.' In the television age, those images,

more that anything else, confer the mantle of authority and legitimacy on a

leader.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The notion that it is media images, not the votes of citizens accurately

counted, that give legitimacy to a leader is profoundly anti-democratic. The

media's role in trying to shore up the fragile credibility of the

establishment was a theme in the most insightful piece in the New York

Times' inauguration coverage, &quot;Reality of Nation's Divisions Quickly Creeps

into the Commentary, &quot; by TV critic Caryn James. She notes TV pundits'

attempt to &quot;retreat into a soothing little bubble where every action they

observe is majestic and every viewer shares their sense of awe&quot;--a bubble

that was punctured by &quot;visible evidence of furious protesters along the

parade route.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because it was not obliged to present live video footage of that &quot;visible

evidence,&quot; the New York Times was much more successful than the television

networks in minimizing the fact that tens of thousands of citizens from

across the country marched on D.C. to reject Bush's assumption of power as

illegitimate and undemocratic.  The Times left readers with the impression

that the dominant themes of the day were &quot;Unity,&quot; &quot;Tradition&quot; and, above

all, &quot;Legitimacy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

ACTION: Please write to the New York Times if you thought that the protests

against George W. Bush's inauguration were an important story and deserved

more prominence in the Times' inauguration coverage.</font></p>
