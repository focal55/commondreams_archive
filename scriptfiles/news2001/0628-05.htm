- June 28 - The Sierra Club today applauded the House of Representatives for

voting to protect the Great Lakes from destructive oil and gas drilling.

The House approved an amendment, introduced by Reps. David Bonior (D-MI),

Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Steven LaTourette (R-OH) and Bart Stupak (D-MI), to

the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2311) that would prevent

drilling for oil or gas beneath the Great Lakes.  This amendment passed by

a vote of 265 to 157.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans don't want oil drills looming on our beaches or oil spills

ruining our Great Lakes,&quot; said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra

Club.  &quot;By approving the Bonior amendment, the House has rightly protected

another fragile coastline that President Bush has supported opening up to

destructive development.  Instead of President Bush's drill, dig and

destroy approach to finding fossil fuel, Americans want a balanced approach

that gives us quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer solutions, like

energy-efficient technologies, renewable power like solar and wind, and

responsible production.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The approaching Independence Day holiday is a perfect reminder that

millions of Americans rely on the Great Lakes for drinking water and

recreation.  Drilling in these delicate areas would be a slap in the face

to Americans who want to protect our Great Lakes' beaches and fragile

shores. We can meet our energy needs without ruining our favorite beaches

and coastlines,&quot; continued Pope.   &quot;We applaud those Representatives who

stood up for all Americans and blocked efforts to destroy our Great Lakes

and coastlines.  Americans owe a debt of gratitude to Reps. Bonior, Kaptur,

LaTourette and Stupak for leading this battle to protect our Great Lakes

for our families and for our future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vote today to prevent oil drilling in the Great Lakes is the latest

rejection of President Bush's irresponsible energy plan.  Last week, the

House struck down efforts to allow drilling for oil and mining for coal in

our National Monuments and off the coast of Florida.  The House also voted

to force mining companies to pay to clean up their own messes.
