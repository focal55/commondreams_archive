- June 13 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is launching a housing reconstruction project centered in the hardest hit areas of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The project will help Palestinian families in need meet the costs of repairing their damaged homes or to find alternative housing. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the years since the 1967 Six-Day War brought the widely contested Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, thousands of Palestinians have watched their homes destroyed and more than 30,000 have been left homeless. This destruction, part of Israeli government policy, enables illegal building of Israeli settlements and by-pass roads over the lands Palestinian families now call home. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 16 people became homeless Monday, when an Israeli demolition crew, accompanied by hundreds of armed police, reduced their home to rubble. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For many years, courageous Palestinian and Israeli peace activists have literally stood in the path of Israeli bulldozers sent to demolish Palestinian homes. Since September 2000, the beginning of the current intifada or Palestinian uprising against occupation, activists have put their lives on the line by going into Palestinian villages and towns targeted by Israeli tanks, in the hopes that their presence would lead to restraint on the part of the military. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC, as an organization based on Quaker values, respect for sanctity of life and non-violence as a way of life and struggle, believes that peace will not be gained through the barrel of an Israeli gun or the dynamite strapped to the body of a Palestinian suicide bomber. AFSC sees the home reconstruction project as an emergency plan that will contribute to the improvement and rebuilding of the family and community life in the areas affected by the destruction, which will ultimately reduce the amount of violence among peoples. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC has a long history of working to halt home demolition. Recently AFSC, with the support of eight U.S. based non-governmental organizations, organized a speaking tour for Salim Shawamreh, a Palestinian engineer whose Jerusalem area home has been demolished twice by the Israeli authorities, and Jeff Halper, anthropologist and coordinator of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolition (ICAHD). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This AFSC reconstruction project offers another way for activists to come together and build peace. Donations should be directed to AFSC, marked &quot;Palestine Reconstruction Fund,&quot; and mailed to: AFSC/Development, 1501 Cherry St., Philadelphia, PA 19102. To contribute via Visa or Mastercard, call 1-888-588-2372, ext. 1. </font></p>
