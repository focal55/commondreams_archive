- January 9 -  The National Organization for Women

opposes confirmation of attorney general nominee John Ashcroft and states

confidently, without any need to distort his record, that John Ashcroft

is soft on the Constitution.

<p>Ashcroft is soft on equal rights for women and the rights to free speech

and to petition the government. He used his position as attorney general

of Missouri to try to advance his political agenda by denying NOW's constitutional

right to call for a boycott of states which had&nbsp; not ratified the

Equal

Rights Amendment.

<p>Ashcroft is soft on the right to privacy, especially the rights to birth

control and abortion. His opposition to reproductive

rights is so extreme that he has urged a ban not only on abortion (even

in cases of rape and incest), but also some of the most effective forms

of birth control.

<p>Ashcroft is soft on the separation of church and state. He advocates

giving public funds, including monies for public education, to church-run

programs, without adequate protection against proselytizing and discrimination

in hiring and provision of services.

<p>Others at today's news conference will address additional concerns we

share about the Ashcroft nomination: his opposition to affirmative action,

hate crimes legislation, and hand gun control; his praise for a white supremist

publication and honorary degree from Bob Jones University; his opportunistic

and disingenuous distortion of Judge Ronnie White's record for his own

political advancement, so reminiscent of his decision to sue NOW over the

ERA boycott.

<p>The U.S. attorney general has an extraordinarily powerful and broad-ranging

position. In setting law enforcement priorities for the Department of Justice,

would John Ashcroft direct adequate attention to the Freedom of Access

to Clinic Entrances Act or the Violence

Against Women Act? Could the department under Ashcroft's leadership

be counted on even to gather the statistics on hate crimes and violence

against women?

<p>In deciding what cases the department should appeal and on what grounds,

in advising the president on nominees for federal court judges and Supreme

Court justices, would Ashcroft seek to build or to dismantle civil rights,

civil liberties, women's rights and reproductive freedom?

<p>Based on Ashcroft's record we must regretfully answer all of these questions

"no," and we must say "no" to John Ashcroft's nomination as Attorney General.
