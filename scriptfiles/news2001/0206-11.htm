- February 6 - Although a trade panel is

expected this week to order the United States to permit access to all U.S. roads by

Mexican trucks, the U.S. should continue to limit access because of the grave dangers many

Mexican trucks pose to motorists on U.S. highways, Public Citizen has concluded in a

report released today.

<p>A North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) tribunal is expected to reject U.S.

concerns about truck safety and order the U.S. to permit Mexican trucks to have full

access to American highways. Currently, Mexican trucks are confined to a narrow, 20-mile

commercial zone near the border. </p>



<p>The report<i>, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/pctrade/nafta/reports/truckstudy.htm">The

Coming NAFTA Crash:<font FACE="Arial"> </font>The Deadly Impact of a Secret NAFTA

Tribunal&#146;s Decision to Open U.S. Highways to Unsafe Mexican Trucks</a></i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">, </font>documents that Mexico<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s

truck safety regulations are virtually non-existent, that Mexican trucks have far more

safety deficiencies than U.S. trucks, that a disproportionate number of Mexican trucks

crossing the border have been taken out of service for serious safety violations, and that

the U.S. lacks enough inspectors to check incoming trucks. Further, Texas border

communities within the commercial border zone in which Mexican trucks are permitted have

seen a dramatic increase in highway fatalities and serious injuries from crashes involving

trucks with Mexican registrations, the report found. The report is available at <a href="http://www.citizen.org/pctrade/nafta/reports/truckstudy.htm"><i>http://www.tradewatch.org/nafta/naftapg.html</i></a>.</p>

<p>&quot;It is imperative that we continue to limit access for these dangerous

trucks even if it means paying trade sanctions,<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>

said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>It

is impossible to inspect every truck, and we cannot knowingly put drivers at risk by

inviting dangerous rigs onto U.S. highways.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font></p>



<p>Added Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s

Global Trade Watch, which produced the report, <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font>This

ruling once again provides a dramatic example of how trade agreements such as NAFTA reach

far beyond appropriate commercial issues and threaten vital domestic health and safety

standards, even when these standards are applied equally to domestic and foreign commerce.<font face="WP TypographicSymbols">&quot;</font></p>



<p>How the Bush administration handles the NAFTA truck issue will have a dramatic impact

on public opinion about President Bush and NAFTA, the report concludes. Many in the

corporate business lobby that financed Bush<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s

campaign are eager to see Mexican trucks gain full access to U.S. highways. However, many

other Americans <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">--</font> particularly in Texas,

California, Arizona and New Mexico <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">--</font> are

legitimately concerned that a flood of unsafe, unregulated freight trucks from Mexico

would pose a significant threat.</p>



<p>The NAFTA truck issue has percolated for years. A provision in NAFTA, which took effect

in 1994, required the United States to allow Mexican trucks to cross the border and access

all border-state roads starting in 1995, and to drive anywhere in the country by January

2000. The Clinton administration for five years recognized the danger the trucks posed to

the public safety and maintained their limited access to a narrow zone at the border.</p>



<p>Mexico challenged the U.S. government<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s

action before a NAFTA enforcement tribunal. On Nov. 29, 2000, the panel issued a

preliminary ruling declaring that the United States was violating NAFTA by refusing to

allow Mexican trucks to cross the border and rejecting U.S. safety concerns raised as a

defense. The ruling expected this week is final and is not expected to vary significantly

from November<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s ruling.</p>



<p>Mexican trucks that operate in the U.S. must apply for operating permits from the U.S.

Department of Transportation. The preliminary NAFTA ruling noted that the U.S. could use

this system to apply its safety standards but that the U.S. also must meet NAFTA&#146;s

requirement for open access for Mexican trucks. The only way to ensure U.S. standards are

being met would be to check every truck that crosses the border, and this is not

practical. The report found that:



<ul>

  <li>Fewer than 1 percent of Mexican trucks entering the U.S. are inspected, but 35 percent

    of those are taken out of service for serious safety failures (46 percent higher than the

    out-of-service rate for U.S. trucks). The U.S. has neither the facilities nor the

    personnel to inspect every truck;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>Although Mexico pledged to institute a comprehensive truck safety program when NAFTA

    went into effect, seven years later, that country still has not instituted an effective

    system. The new rules now in effect are voluntary and are to be phased in over the next

    two years; </li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>Mexico does not limit the time drivers spend behind the wheel. Some drivers report being

    required to drive 36 hours straight with just a six-hour break before returning to the

    road;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>Mexico<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">'</font>s hazardous materials control system is

    much laxer than the U.S. system. Many substances that must be identified in the U.S. need

    not be marked with an official placard in Mexico;</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>Mexican truck carriers last year were more than three times as likely to have safety

    deficiencies as U.S. carriers, and Mexican trucks are twice as likely to be deficient in

    one safety category; and,</li>

</ul>



<ul>

  <li>When Mexican trucks are inspected at the border, the inspections are often<b> </b>not

    full inspections, but instead involve mere visual checks.</li>

</ul>



<p>The report urges the U.S. to press Mexico to fulfill its promise to implement and

enforce adequate truck safety standards. Mexico also needs a real inspection system,

better safety standards for trucking companies, hours-of-service rules for drivers and

more stringent regulatory oversight. Further, the U.S. must dramatically increase border

inspections and should heavily fine Mexican motor carriers found operating outside

permitted areas in the U.S.
