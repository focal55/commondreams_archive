- March 5 - Today's handgun

shooting at the Santana High School in Santee, Calif., is the

latest incident starkly illustrating the need for a ban on the

most deadly category of firearms -- the easily concealable

handgun -- the Violence Policy Center (VPC) stated today. The

VPC is a national organization working to reduce gun death and

injury in America.

<p>The Santana High School shooting follows last month's

shootings, outside the White House and at a Navistar engine

assembly plant in Melrose Park, Ill. Earlier this year caches

of weapons held by college and high school students planning

copycat shootings similar to the 1999 Columbine massacre were

found by law enforcement officials in California and Kansas. In

1998, there were 2,887 children and young adults, aged 18 and

under, killed by firearms in the U.S.

<p>Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy

Center and author of the new book Every Handgun is Aimed at You:

The Case for Banning Handguns (The New Press/March 2001) states,

"The single bloody thread that runs through these incidents is

the easy accessibility we allow our citizens to the most lethal

categories of firearms, such as handguns. After these shootings

a predictable pattern emerges, we quickly look for a loophole to

be plugged, a limited law that could be better enforced, or

other `common sense' solutions, while never stepping back to

look at the big picture: the freeflow of guns in our nation.

America's gun violence problem will not be solved by licensing

and registration, trigger locks, or lamentations over the evil

in men's hearts. These tragic shootings are America's future

until we eliminate handguns, the tools that make such violence

possible."
