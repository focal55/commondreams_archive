- April 10 -  An independent firm of

accountants unveiled a study today in Washington that shows the

International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can afford to cancel

100 percent of the debts they are owed by the poorest countries.

<p>London firm Chantrey Vellacott DFK's research is contained in a

new report by Drop the Debt, the short-term successor to Jubilee 2000

in the UK, which highlights how deeper debt cancellation is

affordable and urgently required to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS in

Africa. While G7 countries have pledged to wipe out the total debts

they are owed by many of these countries, the IMF and World Bank have

failed to do so.

<p>The report "Reality Check: the need for deeper debt cancellation

and the fight against HIV/AIDS" contains the following new findings:

<p>-- After the first 22 countries have been through the existing

Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative agreed in

1999, they will owe more to the IMF and World Bank than they do to

the next largest 17 creditors combined

<p>-- The IMF and the World Bank can afford 100 percent cancellation

through a number of options, including use of reserves and net

income, without impacting adversely on their ability to carry out

their objectives

<p>-- The 17 African countries that have benefited from HIPC will

still spend $1.4 billion repaying debts each year; UNAIDS estimates

the same countries require $1.5 billion to scale up their effort to

combat HIV/AIDS to an adequate level

<p>-- Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole spends $13.3 billion repaying

debts each year; the Global AIDS Alliance estimates that Sub-Saharan

countries could need up to $15 billion each year to fight the spread

of HIV/AIDS

<p>-- The annual cost of canceling HIPC debt owed to the World Bank

and the IMF is $353 million and $368 million respectively -- this is

equivalent to a dollar each year for every person in the G7 countries

<p>Adrian Lovett, director of Drop the Debt, said, "The AIDS crisis

is devastating Africa and the continent's biggest creditors, the IMF

and World Bank, are still taking the money. They should take a

reality check and act now to cancel the debt. From today, the old

excuse that they cannot afford to do so is comprehensively

demolished."

<p>Maurice Fitzpatrick, author of Chantrey Vellacott's audit found

that "the existing debts due to the World Bank and IMF could be

completely cancelled ... without jeopardizing the ability of the

World Bank and the IMF to carry out their overall functions."

<p>The report was launched at a Drop the Debt/Oxfam conference and

discussed by a panel including Adam Lerrick, Carnegie-Mellon

University, Adrian Lovett, Drop the Debt, JoMarie Griesgraber Oxfam,

Edith Ssampala, Ugandan Ambassador to the U.S., representatives from

the IMF and World Bank, and Maurice Fitzpatrick, Chantrey Vellacott.
