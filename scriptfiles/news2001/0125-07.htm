- January 25 - President George W. Bush in his first week in Washington has

warned of a "huge energy crisis," threatened to invade the Arctic

National Wildlife Refuge to drill for oil and gas, rejected calls

to remove dams to save Pacific salmon, and told CNN, "If there's

any environmental regulations that's preventing California from

having a 100 percent max output at their plants, as I understand

there may be, then we need to relax those regulations."

<p>By early February, the president's allies in Congress plan to

introduce legislation to attack the Arctic Refuge -- among other

hasty measures that would give up too much, to get too little

energy, too late.

<p>In response, American Rivers President Rebecca R. Wodder today

issued the following statement:

<p>"President Bush has wasted no time in declaring that the 'energy

crisis' warrants a rollback in environmental regulations. This is

hasty, unwise, and unnecessary, and it's not what the American

people voted for on Election Day.

<p>"The short-term energy problems that California is experiencing

are the fault of poor management and maintenance by the utility

corporations themselves, combined with a failed state deregulation

scheme. The new president should not try to blame those problems on

citizens who want their environment protected, or imagine that

rolling back environmental protections will solve them.

<p>On removing dams to save salmon:

<p>"In particular, American Rivers rejects the notion that America

has to give up on saving the legendary wild salmon of the Snake

River just to close a short-term gap between energy supply and

demand. Although the President has claimed that, 'I don't notice

anybody talking anymore about breaching the dams to save the salmon

now that there's a huge energy crisis,' the two are not linked. The

existing energy shortage will be resolved in the next few years,

whereas the removal of the Snake River dams will not occur for at

least five years. The weight of scientific evidence indicates that

the Snake River's wild salmon will go extinct without dam

breaching. And as recently as last month, tens of thousands of

Northwest residents successfully appealed to the White House to set

dam removal in motion in five years, if needed to save the salmon.

<p>"Demand can and will be reduced immediately through

conservation. Efficiency measures can follow; we still waste two

out of every three energy dollars in this country. And within 2-3

years, new generating plants with pollution-limiting technology

will be online to handle future needs. Driving wild salmon into

extinction for eternity is not worth a tiny fraction of one percent

of our nation's energy needs, which is all it would take to remove

four Snake River dams that are killing salmon, and to operate all

the rest of the nation's hydroelectric dams in an environmentally

sound manner. Finding such win-win solutions is the goal of the Low

Impact Hydropower Institute, which American Rivers is proud to

support.

<p>On the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge:

<p>"We also reject the claim that it is necessary to invade one of

our country's most pristine environmental sanctuaries with drilling

rigs, waste dumps, roads, pipelines, and other facilities that

would permanently scar the land, fragment wildlife habitat, and

clog its rivers, for the sake of a few months' worth of energy, 10

years or more from now. Ruining the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

for a few months' supply of oil that far in the future will in no

way benefit California's present and future needs for electricity.

<p>"President Bush has stated twice in the past week that he will

review 'all federal lands' for oil and gas exploration, without any

mention of excluding national parks, monuments, wilderness areas,

other wild public lands, or wild and scenic river corridors from

the review. That would turn on its head decades of precedents on

protecting our most sensitive federal lands.

<p>Solving the "energy crisis":

<p>"Will we sacrifice the last best places and the last of wild

species to avoid acting responsibly for a few more years?

<p>"What will it take for us, as a nation, to get serious about

renewable energy and conservation?

<p>"What will it take to get far-sighted leadership from our

elected officials that will put us on a path to a sustainable

future?"

<p>"So far, the Bush administration's solutions to the short-term

energy shortage in California seem to be to dam, dig, drill, and

burn our way out. This will not only fail to help those who are now

suffering from rolling blackouts, it will endanger the health of

our citizens and leave future generations with a legacy of

destruction and extinction.

<p>"We don't have to give up environmental protection for economic

progress. Instead, we need solutions that are sustainable and

forward-thinking:

<p>-- "We must ensure that we use best practices and

state-of-the-art technologies in our current energy production

methods;

<p>-- "We must further develop and support alternative

technologies, including wind power, fuel cells, and decentralized

energy production;

<p>-- "And we must aggressively support energy efficiency and

conservation programs that will allow us to enjoy a better standard

of living while using half of the energy, as people already do in

Japan and Europe.

<p>-- "This is the best path out of the current energy shortfall,

not slashing environmental protections we'll need long after this

current crisis has passed."
