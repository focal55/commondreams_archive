- February 28 - Experts at the Center For Defense Information (CDI), anindependent research organization which monitors military affairs, today

questioned the Bush Administration's decision to add billions of dollars in

Pentagon spending.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This budget returns us to Cold War spending levels,&quot; said Colonel Daniel

Smith, USA (Ret.), CDI's Director of Research.  &quot;The U.S. already spends

substantially more for military forces than any other nation, with no

significant threats to our national security.  We should be looking at

options for reducing military spending, not increasing it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush Administration is requesting $310.5 billion for the Defense

Department in Fiscal Year 2002.  They are also requesting $14.3 billion for

the defense functions of the Department of Energy.  In all, the Pentagon is

seeking $324.8 billion in military spending, $14.2 billion more than last

year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is just the first round in the bidding,&quot; said Christopher Hellman,

CDI's budget specialist.  &quot;Congress has yet to work its will, and then

there is any supplemental spending that might be added next year, something

that has become an annual event.  I'm confident that by the time we close

the books on Fiscal Year 2002 we'll see $10 billion to $15 billion more in

the Pentagon's budget, above the increases requested by the Administration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the proposed increase, the Administration is including $1.4

billion for pay and benefits and $400 million for improved housing.  The

request also includes an additional $2.6 billion for research and development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Additional funding for research and development is a good investment, both

for the military and the country,&quot; said Hellman.  &quot;Pay and benefits are an

important component of attracting and retaining quality personnel, which

are the cornerstone of our military.  To be honest, given the extent of the

military's housing problems, $400 million won't get you very far.  But at

least it's a start. But the fact is, there's plenty of room in the current Pentagon budget to fund these initiatives.  Further funding increases

aren't needed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration is also seeking additional military base closures,

something that the Pentagon has requested &#150; and Congress denied &#150; for each

of the past several years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For political reasons, in the past base closures were 'dead on arrival' on

Capitol Hill,&quot; said Colonel Smith. &quot;But there's savings to be had here.

Hopefully the political dynamic has changed.&quot;</font></p>
