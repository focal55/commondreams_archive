<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 4 - The Sierra Club today expressed frustration with the

Members of the House of Representatives who voted against helping farmers

safeguard clean water, protect wetlands, and prevent suburban sprawl.

Leading the effort to protect the environment and hold corporate factory

farms responsible for their pollution were Reps. Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY),

Ron Kind (D-WI), Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD) and John Dingell (D-MI), who

introduced the proposal.  The amendment narrowly failed by a vote of 200 to

226.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are disappointed that the House passed up an opportunity to help

farmers safeguard our wetlands, clean air and clean water.  Instead, the

House handed tax payers the bill for cleaning up the mess made by giant,

corporate-owned farms,&quot; said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra

Club.  &quot;However, we are grateful to those Representatives who stood up to

corporate interests to protect the health and wallets of all Americans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan, introduced as an amendment to a 10-year Farm Bill, would have

increased funding for the successful Conservation Reserve Program, which

pays farmers to leave highly erosion-prone stream banks and other sensitive

lands alone, protecting 45 million acres.  Additionally, the amendment

would have increased funding for the Wetlands Reserve Program, allowing

farmers to restore at least 250,000 acres of threatened wetlands per year.

It also would have increased funding to protect farmland from suburban

sprawl.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While we are disappointed that the House turned its back on family farms

and clean water, we are hopeful that the Senate will stand up and protect

our wetlands, clean water and open space,&quot; continued Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

America's drinking water, rivers and lakes are at risk from factory farms.

These Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) confine thousands of

animals in one facility and produce staggering amounts of animal waste in

the process (2.7 trillion pounds per year). Too often, this waste leaks

into our rivers and streams, fouling our air, contaminating our drinking

water and spreading disease. According to the Environmental Protection

Agency, hog, chicken and cattle waste has polluted 35,000 miles of rivers

in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states.
