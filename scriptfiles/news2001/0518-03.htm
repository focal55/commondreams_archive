When you think of Silicon Valley, images of newly made millionaires come to mind.  Amy Dean, of Working Partnerships USA, thinks of someone else.  Her work drives home the reality of temp workers in Silicon Valley who not only are detached from the valley's fortune, but also remain so poor they can't afford housing.  Marcy Whitebook and Peggy Haack of the Center for Child Care Workforce have other stories to share where child care providers without health benefits care for other people's sick children.  In Long Island, Nadia Marin-Molina and Lilliam Araujo of the Workplace Project have heartbreaking stories of women who escaped grinding poverty in their home countries only to find similar poverty as domestic workers in the United States.  These are the real images of America's workers - the one's whose stories go unheard.

On May 23 celebrities and leaders from the entertainment, philanthropic, and business communities will pay tribute to grassroots women leaders who fight to give voices and faces to the invisible workers plagued by low-wages.  In recognition of women's limited economic opportunities, this year's Gloria Award recipients are all veterans of the movement to secure decent wages, benefits, and working conditions for women.

<p></p>

"As the Bush Administration's tax plan renders 17 million women living near or under the poverty line invisible, I see the women we are honoring as leaders in a campaign ensuring that low-income workers have a voice in the national dialogue about poverty and low wages," says Marie C. Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation for Women.

Among the attendees will be candidate for NYC Public Advocate, Betsy Gotbaum; chair of Oxygen Media, Geraldine Laybourne; Carolines Comedy Club owner, Caroline P. Hirsch; president of Planned Parenthood, Gloria Feldt; interior designer, Freya Block; and best-selling author Dorothea Benton Frank.

In 1989, the Gloria Awards was created to recognize activists who positively impacted their communities. "There's still a pink-collared ghetto of jobs that are almost totally female," says Gloria Steinem.  "That's where most women are, but 'equal pay' doesn't help.  It's the organizers and troublemakers who are lifting up whole categories of women's work that we are honoring this year.  Every one of their lives could be an Erin Brockovich movie too."

The Ms. Foundation's premiere fundraising event, the Gloria Awards raises funds for cutting-edge projects across the country.  It enables the Foundation to support programs that give girls the skills they need to become the leaders of tomorrow, protect the health and safety of women and girls, and provide low-income women with the tools to attain economic security.

This year's awardees share a common goal: helping women achieve financial security.  As grantees of the Ms. Foundation's New Voices, Proactive Strategies Initiative, they aim to assist women struggling to make ends meet improve their incomes, working conditions, and benefits.  The Initiative focuses on developing the leadership skills of low-income women, so they can raise their collective voice and draw national attention to the issues affecting their lives.
