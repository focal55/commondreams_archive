<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - November 8 - More than 200 clinics 

and pro-choice organizations around the country today received 

FedEx packages with a powdery substance inside. Some of the 

packages contained letters signed by the Army of God, a domestic 

terrorist group, indicating that the powder was anthrax. The 

National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood Federation 

of America were falsely listed as the senders of the packages. 

At the same time that the NAF office began receiving calls from 

member clinics who had received the packages, a bomb threat was 

called into NAF and the office was evacuated. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Anti-choice extremists have upped the ante with this latest 

attempt to terrorize abortion providers and those working to 

protect a woman's right to choose,&quot; said Vicki Saporta, 

Executive Director of the National Abortion Federation (NAF). 

&quot;Despite this latest round of threats, our clinics remain open 

and committed to providing women with legally protected 

reproductive health care services.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Abortion Federation has notified its members 

through fax and email not to open similar packages from FedEx. 

In addition, NAF staff has been in contact with FedEx, the FBI, 

and local law enforcement officials around the country. FedEx is 

halting the further delivery of similar packages. As part of its 

national investigation into the anthrax threat letters that were 

sent to more than 280 clinics in the middle of October, the FBI 

is collecting the FedEx packages and prioritizing their testing 

for anthrax. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is clearly the work of individuals who support 

terrorism as a means to advance their political agenda,&quot; said 

Saporta. &quot;Since the last round of anthrax threat letters was 

sent to clinics three weeks ago, we have been working closely 

with the FBI on their investigation. We are confident that those 

responsible for these cowardly acts will be brought to justice.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more information, or to obtain a copy of the National 

Abortion Federation's brochure on anthrax, please call Stephanie 

Mueller at 202-667-5881. </font></p>
