<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 23 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">============<br>

Majority Leader:<br>

============ <br>

Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) is Majority Leader rather than Sen. Trent Lott

(R-MS)</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significance: If the President decides to support arms control agreements

such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it will be easier to get those

treaties out of committee and onto the Senate floor (although ratification

will still be difficult).  Controversial Pentagon or State Department

nominees may have more difficulty gaining time for full Senate

consideration of their nominations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">=====================<br>

Armed Services Committee:<br>

=====================<br>

Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) is Chairman rather than Sen. John Warner (R-VA)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significance: Probably not much change on military spending levels or for

the future of weapons programs (there tends to be bi-partisan support for

high military budgets and most weapons), but new hurdles to the Bush

Administration's plans to deploy National Missile Defense (i.e., perhaps it

will be harder for Bush to win funding this year for constructions of the

radar site in Alaska), easier to restore funding for non-proliferationprograms that Bush has cut, somewhat less smooth confirmations for

controversial Pentagon nominees, more sympathetic view towards future base

closing (BRAC) from Chairman Levin, more likely to hear pro-arms control

witnesses and schedule hearings that focus on Democratic priority defense

issues.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">======================<br>

Foreign Relations Committee:<br>

======================<br>

Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE) is chairman rather than Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significance: Potential rejuvenation of moribund committee, no longer a

graveyard of arms control treaties, more likely to hold hearings on major

foreign relations issues, more likely to have pro-arms control witnesses on

the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and

other topics, makes a Biden run for President slightly less likely and a

Helms retirement slightly more likely.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">====================<br>

Appropriations Committee:<br>

====================<br>

Sen. Robert Byrd (D-WV) is chairman rather than Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Potential significance: Byrd more inclined than Stevens to hike domestic

spending at the expense of military spending; he has also been very

critical of Pentagon accounting woes, when Chairman Byrd allocates

appropriations totals to the various appropriations subcommittees, funding

may not be so generous for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==============================<br>

Defense Appropriations Subcommittee:<br>

==============================<br>

Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-HI) is chairman rather than Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significance: Not much, because of similar views of the two Senators, both

of whom support high military spending and national missile defense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">====================<br>

Senate Budget Committee:<br>

====================<br>

Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) is chairman rather than Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM)   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Significance: Bush budget priorities have more difficulty in the future,

the Committee is likely to mark-up a budget resolution next year (this

year, the committee failed to produce a budget resolution), somewhat more

focus on domestic spending priorities and somewhat less on defense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==================<br>

Conference committees:<br>

==================<br>

Because Democrats will have a majority of Senate conferees and Republicans

a majority of House conferees, the results are likely to be more bipartisan.</font></p>
