- May 16 - As President Bush prepares to travel to Minnesota to

present his plan to address the future energy needs of the nation, U.S. Senator

Paul Wellstone (D-MN) today joined Senator Mark Dayton to issue a strong

challenge in a letter to the President to restore deep cuts in his budget to

Renewable Energy Funds vital to Minnesota's future economic growth.  The Bush

budget for 2002 slashes funds from the Department of Energy's programs for

renewable energy research into clean sources like wind and solar power, ethanol

and biodiesel by 50%, at the same time the President is calling for

government-backed fossil fuel exploration and power plant building.   Wellstone

also pressed the President to make a firm commitment to increasing the nation's

use of clean ethanol and biodiesel to meet 3% of the nation's motor fuel market

within ten years -  providing energy, environmental and economic benefits for

the nation and Minnesota</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The big oil companies don't want our country to move to  renewable energy

development.  They support more drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

and the weakening of environmental, health and safety standards.  Minnesota is a

cold-weather state at the wrong end of the fossil fuels pipeline; we import

nearly all of our energy today.  Reducing our dependence on unsustainable fossil

fuels will take far-sighted policy, and  Minnesota can help lead the way.  The

future for our economy in Minnesota is clean, efficient, renewable energy, and

if the President is coming here to talk about energy policy, he has to

reconsider his budget cuts in this area, and make a real commitment on renewable

energy.&quot; Wellstone said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minnesota is a leader in the development of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel

and ethanol, which are increasingly important sources of transportation fuel in

the country.   Today, ethanol production in Minnesota is over 250 million

gallons a year.  As Minnesota's 14 farmer-owned cooperatives continue to invest

in value-added processing, ethanol production will rise to well over 300 million

gallons by the end of this year.  Minnesota's increased production and use of

ethanol and biodiesel boosts energy, environmental and economic public policy

goals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wind power in Minnesota, for example, currently producing electricity for 3 to 6

cents per kilowatt-hour, is competitive with the cost of electricity from a new

coal-fired power plant. Through additional investment the price could reach 2.5

cents a kilowatt hour within the next few years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President's budget cuts funding for renewable energy development next year

by 50 percent, but he has an opportunity to restore these cuts in his Energy

Task Force Report on Thursday.   Given the current energy price crisis in our

country, investments in renewable energy development have never been more

important, particularly in our state.  Renewable energy development promotes

keeping capital investments in Minnesota, rather than continuing to spend $6

billion each year to import coal, oil and nuclear fuel.  Renewable energy

production also boosts  our rural communities, who continue to suffer under a

depressed farm economy,&quot; Wellstone said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone also challenged Bush to make a substantive commitment to the largely

untapped energy produced by America's farmers: ethanol and biodiesel.  It would

decrease the need for imported petroleum products, help improve air quality

across the country by reducing carbon monoxide and other toxic emissions, and

provide an important economic stimulus to rural America. A 3% market share for

ethanol and biodiesel, which Wellstone is pushing, would replace about 9 billion

gallons of gasoline annually or between 500,000 and 600,000 barrels of crude oil

each day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

The Honorable George W. Bush<br>

President of the United States<br>

The White House<br>

Washington, DC 20500</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. President:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In advance of your appearance in Minnesota this week to announce the

Administration's energy proposals, we are writing to  urge you strongly to make

a substantive commitment to energy conservation, as well as to renewable energy

development and funding. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your Budget for fiscal year 2002 proposed cutting federal funding for renewable

energy research and development by 50 percent, and it proposed cutting funding

for energy conservation research and development by 46 percent. It further

proposed cutting by 48 percent the federal energy management program, which

seeks both to conserve energy and to reduce federal costs through &quot;advancing

energy and water conservation&quot; in the government's own buildings, vehicles and

operations. You now have an opportunity to recommend restoring these cuts

through the Vice President's task force report. We hope you will do so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investments in conservation and renewable energy development have never been

more important, particularly for a state such as Minnesota, which is situated at

the consuming end of the pipeline for non-renewable fossil fuels.  Contrary to

the widely reported suggestion by the Vice President that conservation is little

more than &quot;a sign of personal virtue,&quot; a recent report by scientists at our

national laboratories concluded that improved energy efficiency could reduce

growth in electricity demand by nearly 50 percent. Furthermore, wind power in

Minnesota, currently producing electricity for three to six cents per

kilowatt-hour, is competitive with the cost of electricity from new coal-fired

power plants, which  appear to be favored by the Vice President's task force.

Through additional research and development investments, it has been estimated

that the price of Minnesota wind power could go as low as 2.5 cents a kilowatt

hour within a few years. Development of such renewable energy sources promotes

keeping capital investments in Minnesota, rather than continuing to rely on the

importation of what is now approximately $6 billion worth of coal, oil and

nuclear fuel each year.  Renewable energy production from wind and biomass also

helps boost Minnesota rural communities economically. Creating jobs in

home-grown, forward-looking, innovative industries is key to the prosperity of

Greater Minnesota, where the farm economy continues to struggle under low

commodity prices and poor federal agriculture policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Minnesota is a national leader in the development of renewable fuels, such as

biodiesel and ethanol - increasingly important sources of transportation fuel.  

Ethanol production in Minnesota already exceeds 250 million gallons a year.  As

the state's 14 farmer-owned cooperative ethanol plants continue to invest in

value-added processing, production is expected to top 300 million gallons this

year.  Ethanol and biodiesel fuels reduce dependence on imported petroleum

products, improve air quality and help revitalize the rural economy. As in the

separate, bipartisan letter sent to your Administration today by a number of

Senators, we again urge you to include among your proposals a recommendation to

utilize biofuels to meet at least 3 percent of the nation's motor fuel market

within 10 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We understand that these recommendations may not be looked upon favorably by

oil, coal or utility industry leaders. However, we believe they are central to

any forward_looking and balanced long_term energy strategy. Clean supply_side

technologies should be combined with conservation to address our current

over-reliance on non-renewable energy sources.  Mr. President, we hope that we

can find common ground to establish sound, sustainable, affordable energy policy

for Minnesota and for the country's future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,</font></p>
