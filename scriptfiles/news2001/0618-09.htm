- June 18 - Interior Secretary 

Gale Norton's appointment of an Alaska oil lobbyist as her 

special assistant demonstrates again that her main priority is 

to promote Big Oil's agenda, Defenders of Wildlife said. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As she visits Alaska this week, Secretary Norton pretends to 

be objectively examining whether oil development would harm the 

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the wildlife that depends on 

that magnificent wilderness for survival. But with this 

appointment, the charade is over. She's willing to surrender 

America's greatest wildlife sanctuary to the special interests 

at any cost to the environment,&quot; Defenders of Wildlife Vice 

President Robert Dewey said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norton named Camden Toohey, the director of the pro-oil 

development group Arctic Power, as her special adviser on oil 

drilling in the Arctic refuge and other Alaska-related issues. 

Arctic Power, the main voice for oil drilling in the Arctic 

refuge, receives its money from state tax dollars appropriated 

by the Alaska Legislature and from the British oil giant BP, 

among other funders. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even as Norton was preparing to announce his appointment, 

Toohey told the Anchorage Daily News that his group is still 

lobbying hard for drilling in the refuge despite opposition by 

the Senate's new Democratic majority. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I feel good about our chances,&quot; Toohey said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norton named another Big Oil advocate -- Alaska state Sen. 

Drue Pearce -- as another special assistant on Alaska issues. 

Pearce is also a staunch supporter of drilling in the refuge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dewey said: &quot;If there was any doubt about the Bush 

administration's direct ties to the oil industry, this 

appointment ends it. It's sad enough that the state of Alaska is 

using tax money to fund lobbying for oil rigs in the Arctic 

refuge. Now, Secretary Norton has put the oil lobbyists on the 

public payroll, and all Americans will pay their salaries.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Defenders of Wildlife is a leading nonprofit conservation 

organization recognized as one of the nation's most progressive 

advocates for wildlife and its habitat. With more than 430,000 

members and supporters, Defenders of Wildlife is an effective 

leader on environmental issues. </i></font></p>
