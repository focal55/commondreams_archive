- January 4 - Today's announcement by Senator Thad Cochran that he will support the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill

is a significant development and a profound sign that we have

turned a corner in the fight for reform. I suspect it will not be

the first time we hear from a Senator who wants to join the fight

to shut down the soft money system once and for all.

<p>On behalf of the members of Common Cause and reform supporters

everywhere, I thank Senator Cochran for lending his support for

this effort. Everyone knows that campaign finance reform has

powerful opponents, and it takes a measure of courage to stand

up in defiance of the Washington culture of money, access, and

influence.

<p>As we get closer and closer to gaining the 60 votes necessary to

defeat a filibuster of campaign finance reform, reform opponents in

the Senate will look to other tactics to try and derail the bill.

Unfortunately for them, the public is paying more attention to this

issue than ever before, and will see through any attempts to kill

the bill by larding it up with poison pills or watering it down

with amendments designed to weaken the soft money ban.

<p>And, Senator McCain is right -- the Senate must move on this

vital legislation immediately after the inauguration of the new

president, and before the Bush legislative agenda is ready to

go.

<p>This legislation has the support of the overwhelming majority of

the House of Representatives, and a growing bipartisan majority in

the United States Senate sufficient to defeat a filibuster. Most

important, this bill has the overwhelming support of the American

people who desperately want their federal officials to be less

dependent on special-interest money, and more accountable to the

people they serve.
