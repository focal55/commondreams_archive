- February 27 - Millions of 

  American families that have left welfare are worse off economically today because 

  many state governments are not spending the federal funds intended to help them 

  transition into work or take care of their children, according to a new report 

  made public today.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The states have failed to use more 

  than $8 billion authorized by Congress for child care, transportation, education, 

  job training and other efforts to help support low-wage workers and struggling 

  families, the report found.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Millions of children and their 

  parents are falling deeper into poverty because in too many state capitals the 

  funds that Congress approved to help these families become self sufficient are 

  going unspent,” said Deepak Bhargava, director of the National Campaign for 

  Jobs and Income Support.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A coalition of grassroots citizens 

  groups in 40 states, the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support compiled 

  and released the report, “Poverty Amidst Plenty 2001” at a news conference at 

  the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. to coincide with the winter meeting 

  of the National Governors’ Association.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Despite the enormous need, forty-six 

  states and the District of Columbia are still holding huge sums in unspent Temporary 

  Aid for Needy Families (TANF) funds that could be paying for new or expanded 

  programs to help poor families raise their children, find decent jobs and begin 

  earning a livable wage,” Bhargava said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the report by the 

  National Campaign for Jobs and Income:</font></p>

</font>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Child 

  poverty remains at a historic high, with nearly one out of every five children 

  in America living today in poverty.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 

  spite of the booming national economy, the average person living in poverty 

  is poorer today than they were at the beginning of the decade demonstrating 

  how the poor are being left behind.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many 

  families that have moved “from welfare to work” are worse off financially and 

  struggling with incomes below the poverty line.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More 

  than half of those who have left welfare for jobs have been unable to pay the 

  rent, buy food, afford medical care, or keep their telephone or electric service 

  from being disconnected.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

  spite of the pressing needs of poor families, fourteen states have actually 

  increased their surplus of unspent Temporary Aid for Needy Families funds since 

  1999.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 

  states – Connecticut, Virginia, Texas, Wisconsin and Michigan in particular 

  – are abusing the flexibility of their TANF anti-poverty funds to pay for tax 

  cuts and shortfalls in other areas of their budget on the backs of the poor.</font></li>

</ul>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In unveiling its report, the National Campaign for Jobs and 

  Income Support called on Congress to provide additional funds to fight poverty 

  and to ensure that the states diligently use the money.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Simply cutting the welfare rolls 

  can’t be the measure of success,” Bhargava said. “Congress and the states must 

  be held to their promise that welfare reform would lift families out of poverty, 

  and that will require a commitment of adequate resources.”</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Campaign also urged Congress 

  and the states to involve local community organizations that deal directly with 

  low-income families in the process of drafting and implementing welfare reform 

  laws and programs.</font>
