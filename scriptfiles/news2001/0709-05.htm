- July 9 - Democrats.com, the largest community of Democratic activists on the Internet, will protest George W. Bush's visit to New York City on Tuesday, 

July 10.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest will take place at 1:30 p.m. at Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 

53rd St.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush will be in New York to present the Congressional Gold Medal to the 

family of John Cardinal O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of Democrats.com will be dressed in black to symbolize mourning, 

and will not engage in civil disobedience or show disrepect towards the 

ceremony at St. Patrick's.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Democrats.com co-founder Bob Fertik, &quot;Democrats.com will be 

holding a solemn 'Memorial for Democracy,' because American Democracy died 

on December 12, 2000 when the Republican Supreme Court ordered a halt to 

vote counting and declared Bush the winner. Our message to Bush will be 

subdued and simple: 'Thou Shalt Not Steal,'&quot; Fertik said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats.com has helped organize hundreds of protests against the George 

W. Bush and the Stolen Election since last November, in cities and towns 

across the United States. Democrats.com has also co-sponsored two major 

protest marches in Washington DC, on Inauguration Day and May 19. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Fertik, &quot;After nearly 6 months in office, it is clear that 

George W. Bush's agenda is wrong for America - and wrong for New York.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;New Yorkers want better education, more affordable health care, and a 

cleaner environment. George Bush wants to shift taxes from working people 

to the rich, a missile defense scheme that will never work, and a secret 

war on Medicare and Social Security. Bush is wrong on the issues, and we 

will tell him so,&quot; Fertik said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democrats.com also believes that Bush is an illegitimate President because he did not actually win Florida, but rather stole the election with the help of his brother Jeb and a partisan Republican majority on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Miami Herald's statewide count of uncounted ballots show that Gore actually won Florida by 662 votes, without counting a single disputed chad. The definitive count of nearly 175,000 uncounted ballots by the National Opinion Research Center is expected any day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-sponsors of the New York City protest include Campaign To End The Death Penalty, Citizens For Legitimate Government, DemocracyMarch.org, International 

Action Center, New York Sierra Club, NOW-New York City, and Refuse and 

Resist.</font></p>
