- January 15 - The following was

released today by Friends of the Earth:

<p>January 11, 2001

<p>The Honorable Jeff Bingaman

<br>Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources

<br>703 Hart Senate Office Building

<br>Washington, DC 20510

<p>Dear Senator Bingaman:

<p>On behalf of the thousands of members of Friends of the Earth,

I would like to formally express this organization's opposition to

the nomination of Gale Norton as Secretary of the United States

Department of Interior. Ms. Norton's background and stances on the

key issues of environmental stewardship signal that her policy

initiatives would be a giant step away from recent progress and a

downturn from a balanced approach towards natural resource

conservation.

<p>The Department of the Interior is our nation's principal

conservation agency with jurisdiction over roughly 450 million

acres of Federal lands and about 3 billion acres of the Outer

Continental Shelf. Its responsibilities include stewardship of 80

million acres of national parks, monuments and historical sites,

over 264 million acres of public lands home to over 3,000 species

of wildlife, and the 92 million acre National Wildlife Refuge

System, which includes 509 national wildlife refuges and 37 wetland

management districts. The appointment of Gale Norton as principal

manager of these priceless natural treasures would be a direct

affront on the spirit of environmental protection.

<p>Ms. Norton's anti-environmental background includes:

<p>-- Attorney General of Colorado, where she was a strong advocate

of a state law that allows companies to conduct voluntary audits to

determine their compliance with environmental requirements. This

"self-audit" law also gives businesses immunity from litigation if

they report and correct violations. This and similar laws have

been opposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>-- A Senior Attorney for the Mountain States Legal Foundation

(MSLF), a non-profit law-firm dedicated to undoing public land

protections and weakening environmental laws. During her tenure,

MSLF worked on cases opposing Clean Air Act enforcement in Colorado

and supporting drilling and mining in Wilderness Areas, among

others. Other MSLF alumni include the controversial former

Secretary of Interior, James Watt, whose sympathy towards private

interests and irreverence for environmental laws earned him a

reputation as an anti-environmental crusader.

<p>-- National Chair of the Coalition for Republican Environmental

Advocates (CREA), a front group posing as a pro-environment

"grassroots organization." In fact, CREA was a Political Action

Committee whose steering committee included registered lobbyists

for the petroleum, mining, auto-making, firearms and alcoholic

beverage interests. CREA was funded by Coors Brewing Company, the

American Forest Paper Association, the Chemical Manufacturers

Association, Amoco and similar corporations.

<p>-- A member of the Board of Advisors for the DC-based Defenders

of Property Rights, a legal foundation created to "counterbalance

the governmental threat to private property as a result of a broad

range of regulations." Defenders of Property Rights has

aggressively advocated for "takings" clauses both in Congress and

the courts.

<p>-- Assistant Solicitor in the Department of Interior within the

Reagan Administration, where she worked to persuade Congress to

open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.

<p>-- Current member of the Washington Legal Foundation's (WLF)

Legal Advisory Board. WLF is a foundation whose stated mission is

"to defend and promote the principles of free enterprise and

individual rights," and advocates for the easing of "regulatory

burdens" on industry, and limiting the legal liability of corporate

wrongdoers. WLF's Environmental Law Project is involved in a

variety of "property rights" lawsuits seeking to weaken

environmental protections.

<p>Gale Norton's recent and past affiliations show a consistent

pattern of efforts to undermine and roll back the very

environmental laws and protections she will be sworn to uphold. In

light of this significant conflict of interests, Friends of the

Earth urges you to oppose her nomination as Secretary of the United

States Department of Interior.

&nbsp;

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Brent Blackwelder

<br>President

<br>Friends of the Earth
