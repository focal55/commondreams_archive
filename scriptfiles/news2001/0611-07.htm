- June 11 - The following statement 

was released today by Friends of the Earth: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President can't have his new energy plan AND seriously 

address global climate change. His energy plan is a fossil fuels 

extravaganza that reads like a veritable recipe for heating up the 

planet. Today's speech was all talk and no meaningful action. It was a carefully orchestrated smoke-screen of empty rhetoric from 

which only one thing can be gleaned: Bush knows he has a public 

relations problem when it comes to his handling of important 

environmental issues like climate change. Global climate change is real, U.S. pollution is greatly contributing to it, and the public 

-- both here and abroad -- demand something serious be done to 

address it. And so the President talks. But where is the 

substance of his plan? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By failing to take real actions -- by failing to advocate 

mandatory controls of greenhouse gasses, President Bush sends a 

clear signal: the polluting industries that benefit most from the 

Administration's energy plan are still running the show. Going to Europe with this message can only heighten Bush's image there as an 

arrogant leader who puts the interests of his wealthy, polluting 

friends above those of the health and safety of the entire planet. </font></p>

President, Friends of the Earth </font></p>
