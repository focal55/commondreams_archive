Tuesday night the San Jose City Council considers a resolution to support a landmark State bill to regulate greenhouse gas pollution. Wednesday night, a town hall meeting brings together business leaders, government officials, scientists, environmentalists, and concerned citizens to discuss global warming impacts and California&#146;s opportunity to be a national leader in the effort to reduce our global warming footprint. Speakers at the event include prominent climate change scientist Stephen Schneider and global warming and transportation policy VIP Rod Diridon.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With agreement that global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issue of our time, the main focus of the town hall meeting will be actions California can take to become a national leader in reducing greenhouse gas pollution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The good news is that there are many cost-effective and sensible things we can do to slow global warming and provide benefits at the same time &#151; like decoupling our dependence on foreign oil, reducing health-damaging air pollution and conserving wildlife. Finding win-win solutions should be our focus,&quot; says Stanford scientist Stephen Schneider.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Government leadership on global warming is critical to combating the problem. Tuesday night the San Jose City Council will vote on a resolution to support California Assembly Bill 1058 (Pavley, D-Woodland Hills), which would for the first time in US history require the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. The bill is sponsored by Bluewater Network and supported by all five South Bay Congressional delegates and over 60 environmental, public health, and business groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With this bill, California can show the rest of the nation that it is possible to protect the environment while maintaining a sound economy,&quot; said San Jose City Council member Linda LeZotte.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Continued global warming is going to undermine the State&#146;s long history of environmental victories. By tackling the problem now, California has a real chance to prove again that protecting the environment can stimulate opportunity and economic growth,&quot; said Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The town hall meeting is sponsored by Bluewater Network, Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, California League of Conservation Voters, and the Loma Prieta Sierra Club Chapter. It takes place Wednesday, December 5, 6:00 PM &#150; 8:00 PM San Jose City Hall Council Chambers, 801 N. First Street, San Jose.</font></p>
