- June 12 - A comprehensive 

nationwide survey released today found that more than 80 percent of 

registered voters support licensing handgun owners and registering 

handguns, and fully 92 percent favor criminal background checks for 

all handgun purchases -- a critical component of a strong licensing 

system. The survey of 1,000 registered voters was conducted by the 

respected polling firm Lake, Snell, Perry, and Associates May 

15-21, 2001 and has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percent. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also reported in this poll were attitudes of National Rifle 

Association (NRA) supporters toward specific new gun law proposals. 

The poll found that three quarters of NRA supporters favor measures 

such as licensing and registration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans overwhelmingly support common sense policies like 

licensing and registration and universal criminal background checks 

to stop the transfer of handguns to criminals and youth,&quot; said 

Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Educational Fund to Stop 

Gun Violence, the nonprofit educational charity that commissioned 

the poll. &quot;Congress is currently considering legislation to close 

the gun show loophole by conducting criminal background checks at 

gun shows. Our poll indicates that the public wants all loopholes 

closed through a system of licensing and registration - a system 

that would mandate criminal background checks on all sales.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key Findings </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key findings from the poll included: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 85 percent of registered voters -- and 73 percent of gun 

owners -- favor requiring prospective gun owners to obtain a 

license before buying a handgun. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 83 percent of the registered voters -- and 72 percent of gun 

owners -- favor requiring gun owners to register their newly 

purchased handguns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 92 percent of the registered voters -- and 86 percent of gun 

owners -- favor criminal background checks for all handgun 

purchases, a key component of a licensing and registration system. 

(Asked of a split sample of 500 respondents.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new poll found slightly higher public support for licensing 

and registration than other, recent national gun policy polls. A 

Gallup Poll conducted in October 2000, for example, found that 72 

percent of Americans favored both licensing and registration for 

new handgun purchases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NRA Supporters Also Support New Gun Laws </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also examined the attitudes of citizens who said they 

supported the National Rifle Association, who made up 35.2 percent 

of the sample. The results appear to contradict the rhetoric of 

that organization's leadership: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 66 percent of NRA supporters favor handgun owner licensing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 65 percent of NRA supporters favor handgun registration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- 82 percent of NRA supporters favor universal background 

checks for all handgun purchases. (Asked of a split sample of 352 

NRA supporters.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This poll shows that common sense measures like licensing and 

registration are universally popular - even among those who support 

the National Rifle Association,&quot; said Horwitz. &quot;This historic poll 

confirms what we've always known: the NRA is woefully out of touch 

not only with voters, but with its traditional supporters as well.&quot; 

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most Think Licensing and Registration Already Exist </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surprisingly, 70 percent of registered voters mistakenly believe 

that a system of licensing and registration already exists. 

However, only five states -- New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, 

Connecticut, and Hawaii -- require some form of licensing and 

registration of handguns or its equivalent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Perhaps people believe the NRA leadership's 'enforce existing 

laws' slogan because they think tough laws like licensing and 

registration already exist,&quot; said Horwitz. &quot;But the reality is 

that handgun licensing and registration laws -- laws that could 

significantly dry up the pool of guns falling into criminal hands 

-- do not exist in our country.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. and Rep. Martin Meehan 

(D-Mass.) have introduced legislation in the current Congress to 

create a nationwide licensing and registration system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the state level, two strong handgun licensing bills are 

successfully making their way through the California state 

legislature. Licensing bills have also been introduced in the 

Indiana and Florida state legislatures. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About Licensing and Registration </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Licensing is designed to ensure that every handgun buyer - not 

just those who buy guns at a gun store - undergoes a criminal 

background check, and is trained on safe gun use. Registration 

promotes responsibility among handgun owners and assists law 

enforcement in tracking down guns that are sold or used illegally. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Licensing and registration would work a lot like the system we 

now use to license drivers and register automobiles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Licensing would require handgun purchasers to pass a basic 

safety course and undergo a background check to make sure they are 

not underage, a violent criminal or mentally ill. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Registration would make the legal owner of a gun responsible 

for its safe use and transfer to another owner, dramatically 

reducing the flow of guns from the legal to criminal market. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Registration would also help police track weapons that are 

passed on to another person in a criminal or negligent way, 

including &quot;straw&quot; purchases where a legal buyer purchases guns on 

behalf of someone prohibited from owning them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence </font></p>
