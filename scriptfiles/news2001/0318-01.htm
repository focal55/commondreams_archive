- March 18 - Fourteen leading neuroscientists and drug policy experts are

calling on the U.S. Sentencing Commission to reject a proposal to

treat MDMA ("ecstasy") more severely than heroin.

<p>The Commission will hold a hearing on the proposal on Monday,

March 19, at 9:30 a.m. and is expected to vote Tuesday on the

punishment increase. See

<a href="http://www.ussc.gov/AGENDAS/not3_19_01.htm">http://www.ussc.gov/AGENDAS/not3_19_01.htm</a>.

<p>In a strongly worded statement, bristling with statistical

comparisons, the group of experts said that there was "no

justification, either pharmacologically or in policy terms" for the

proposed increased penalties. "If the Commission were to ratify the

published proposal, the...change in sentencing would...divert

enforcement resources away from heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine

toward MDMA. The result of such a diversion would be to make the

overall drug abuse problem worse."

<p>The statement was issued on behalf of the Federation of American

Scientists by Prof. Charles R. Schuster, director of the National

Institute of Drug Abuse in the Reagan Administration. Signers

included Dr. Jerome Jaffe, who was "drug czar" in the Nixon

Administration.

<p>For the full statement and list of signers, see

<a href="http://www.fas.org/drugs/MDMAsentencing.pdf">http://www.fas.org/drugs/MDMAsentencing.pdf</a>.

<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission establishes binding guidelines that

control sentencing in all Federal criminal cases. In a bill passed

late last year, Congress instructed the Commission to increase the

sentences handed out to dealers in "ecstasy," the most popular of the

"club drugs" whose use has been rising among young people in recent

years.

<p>Sentencing for drug offenses is based primarily on the weight of

the drugs involved in a transaction. "Offense levels" have been

established for various quantities of marijuana, and every other drug

is given an "equivalency" that equates, for sentencing purposes, one

gram of that drug to some number of grams of marijuana. Each gram of

mescaline is treated as ten grams of marijuana, each gram of cocaine

as 500 grams, each gram of heroin as 1000 grams (one kilogram), and

each gram of methamphetamine as two kilograms. The offense level,

combined with the criminal history of the offender, yields the

sentencing range. Some drugs, including MDMA, are further subject to

a minimum offense level, even for small quantities. Someone with no

prior offenses who sold or gave even a single tablet of MDMA would,

under the current rule, would face ten to 16 months in prison.

<p>Currently, one gram of MDMA has an equivalency of 35 grams of

marijuana. The Commission has proposed an equivalency of 1000 grams,

the same as heroin. Since the weight of a typical MDMA tablet is

about ten times the weight of a typical dose of heroin, that means

that each dose of MDMA would have the same sentencing value as ten

doses of heroin. By a similar calculation, the Commission's proposal

would effectively equate for sentencing purposes each dose of MDMA

to

about 800 marijuana cigarettes. The Federation of American

Scientists' statement calls that equivalency "grossly

disproportionate" to the harms involved.

<p>Based on comparisons between the death, addiction, disease, crime,

and other damage created by heroin and MDMA, the drug expert group

suggests that a ten-gram equivalency would be more consistent with

the data. That would treat each dose of MDMA as the equivalent of

one-tenth of a dose of heroin, or about eight marijuana cigarettes.

<p>"We're still finding out about the risks of MDMA use, especially

possible long-term changes in certain brain regions," said Dr.

Schuster, a leading neuroscientist. "No one would say the drug is

safe. But treating it as worse than heroin is irrational. Heroin is

far more addictive, leads to far more overdose deaths, causes

enormous amounts of crime, and helps spread HIV/AIDS. On any one of

those dimensions, MDMA is much less of a threat to public health and

safety."

<p>Alfred Blumstein, former Dean of the Heinz School at Carnegie

Mellon University and for ten years a member of the Pennsylvania

Sentencing Commission, urged the U.S. Sentencing Commission to resist

Congressional pressure to escalate MDMA penalties. "Setting an

extreme sentence for the latest drug-of-the-year destroys the

coherent sentencing structure reflecting the seriousness of the

underlying crime. Creating coherence is the basic mission of a

sentencing commission. It may be hard for legislators to resist the

political pressure, but sentencing commissions don't have to run for

re-election. Their job is to try to bring order out of the political

chaos."

<p>The F.A.S. statement points out that the effect of the proposed

change would go beyond sentencing to influence the distribution of

law enforcement resources, because enforcement agencies and

prosecutors take sentencing as a sign of the relative importance of

cases against different drugs.
