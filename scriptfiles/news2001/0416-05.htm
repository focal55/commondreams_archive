- April 16 - Jos&eacute; Fernando Ram&iacute;rez, the Human Rights Secretary of the oil workers union of Bogot&aacute; and a member of the Executive Committee of the Oil Workers Federation (USO), will speak at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, April 18th at the Brecht Forum at 122 West 27th Street (between 6th and 7th Avenue) on the effects of America's $1.3 billion funding of the Colombian military under &quot;Plan Colombia.&quot; The USO is one of Colombia's largest and most important unions.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Although few Americans know it, the U.S. is currently at war in Colombia,&quot; said Zeno Wood of the Colombia Action Committee (CAC), a New York City-based organization which arranged Mr. Fernando's appearance in Manhattan. According to Amnesty International, Colombia has long had one of the worst human rights records in the Western Hemisphere, with over 3,000 citizens killed in political violence each year. About 75% of these murders are attributable to the Colombian military and the country's right-wing paramilitaries, which, as Human Rights Watch has documented, are closely linked to Colombia's government.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our $1.3 billion contribution to the Colombia military via Plan Colombia has put us right in the middle of a brutal forty year-old civil war,&quot; continued Mr. Wood, &quot;with appalling consequences for Colombia's people. Moreover, U.S. personnel-such as Army pilot Jennifer Odom and her four fellow crew members-have already died, with more sure to come.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;According to our government, Plan Colombia is solely a counter-narcotics program,&quot; said Carolyn Connelly of the CAC. &quot;However, even former Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey has stated that the line between counter-narcotics activities and counter-insurgency attacks against Colombia's guerillas is very blurry. And while the guerillas do support themselves through a tax on coca, Plan Colombia does not take any actions against the paramilitaries, which are even more implicated in the cocaine trade-not surprisingly, considering that some paramilitary organizations started as the private armies of the drug cartels.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conditions in Colombia are especially dangerous for members of trade unions, with paramilitaries targeting union organizers for assassination. Central Unitaria de Trabajadores (CUT), Colombia's largest labor confederation (of which the USO is a member), has seen over 2,500 of its members killed since CUT's founding in 1986. Over 400 members of the Colombia teachers union alone were killed during a recent five year period. In 2000 the AFL-CIO awarded CUT, on behalf of the entire Colombia trade union movement, its George Meany-Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award, in recognition of its role as &quot;leading advocates for peace, human rights, and economic justice&quot; in Colombia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. Fernando's speech will provide a rare opportunity for Americans to hear firsthand about how their money is being spent in Colombia,&quot; said the CAC's Ms. Connelly. &quot;As the U.S. becomes ever more deeply involved in Mr. Fernando's country, the time has come for us to educate ourselves about this dangerous, volatile situation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Fernando will speak for approximately an hour, with a question and answer period following.  The event is free and open to the public.</font></p>
