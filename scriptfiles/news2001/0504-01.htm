Policy<br>

- May 4 - Pointing to yet another Bush

Administration policy designed to enrich former 

employers and major donors of the President and Vice

President, the Association of State Green Parties

today criticized statements by Vice President Cheney

indicating that this administration will pursue an

energy policy based on 19th century models -- and on

dangerous 20th century nuclear power.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If Bush and Cheney were judges, lawyers, or even

legislators, they would need to recuse themselves from

decisions of the type they are making,&quot; said ASGP

Organizing Coordinator Dean Myerson.  &quot;As with

administration non-policy regarding the energy crisis

in California, where the Administration even ignored

pleas from Republican Governors in order to enrich

their former employers, this administration has shown

again that it does not have the interests of Americans

at heart, who continually support renewable energy in

polls.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beside the Bush family's own extensive holdings in

oil, Vice President Dick Cheney is a former CEO of

Halliburton.  The oil and gas industry contributed

$1,846,331 to Bush's 2000 campaign, and $242,371 to

Spencer Abraham's Senate (Michigan) campaign.  After

Abraham lost, Bush appointed him Energy Secretary. 

Among candidates, Bush and Abraham received the first

and third highest contributions from these industries.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S., with 4 percent of the world's population,

uses about 25 percent of the world's energy resources.

 Instead of conversion to renewable energy, the Bush

Administration is using the California energy crisis

and threats of higher prices -- a result of

deregulation in the early 1990s -- as an excuse to

build new nuclear power plants, drill new reserves in

protected natural areas, lay more pipelines, and mine

more coal.  Fossil fuels cause pollution and

greenhouse emissions, spoiled natural areas, and

depleted reserves.  Nuclear power plants cannot

guarantee safety, and no facilities exist for disposal

of dangerous radioactive waste.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have pushed for a massive conversion to

hydrogen fuel cell technology and low-cost wind

turbines, photovoltaic modules, and solar thermal

energy over the next generation, calling these an

urgent necessity in light of increasing global climate

change, which is in part the proven result of human

agency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASGP Co-Chair Annie Goeke noted that, &quot;The United

States is already falling behind in key technology

sectors due to the total lack of leadership shown by

the Clinton Administration regarding energy and its

obstruction of measures to reverse global warming.

Bush policy will speed this up and mire the U.S.

economy with a 19th century infrastructure as the rest

of the world moves headfirst into the 21st century.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have called for the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. President Bush and Vice President Cheney should

excuse themselves from decision which benefit former

employers or major donors.  A non-partisan committee

of U.S. Congress members should be created to replace

Bush and Cheney when they must recuse themselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The National Research Council should create an

emergency energy panel to analyze the capability of

conservation and renewable sources, such as solar,

wind, and fuel cell energy, to contribute to the U.S.

energy supply.  President Bush must reverse his

proposal for spending cuts of 54 percent for solar and

48 percent for wind energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only through a Green energy policy, including the

above steps, can we enact a sane U.S. energy policy

and restore hope for a clean, efficient, and

sufficient energy system.</font></p>
