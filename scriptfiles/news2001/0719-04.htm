- July 19 - The U.S. Senate needs to 

restore funding for three vital, farmer-initiated agriculture 

conservation programs that were zero-funded in the president's 

budget and the House of Representatives' 2002 agriculture 

appropriation bill, according to a television ad campaign launched 

today by Defenders of Wildlife, the National Wildlife Federation, 

and other farm and conservation groups around the country. The ads 

will air in Iowa, Wisconsin, Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, 

and Illinois. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With help from three very popular programs, America's farmers 

have been protecting wildlife, by protecting wildlife habitat,&quot; 

according to the commercial. &quot;But now President Bush is proposing 

the government spend... Nothing for the Wetlands Reserve Program... 

Nothing for Wildlife Habitat Incentives... Nothing for Farmland 

Protection. Will Congress turn that around?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Wildlife Habitat Improvement 

Program (WHIP) and the Farmland Protection Program (FPP) have 

proven extremely popular with stewardship-minded farmers, offering 

them a means to improve conservation performance on their farms 

with projects of their own design. These programs have faced 

chronic under-funding, which culminated in zero-funding in the 

president's budget and the House appropriation for 2002, despite a 

backlog of thousands of farmer proposals for each of the programs, 

representing more than a million acres and habitat for a host of 

wildlife species. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is incredibly short-sighted for the administration and the 

House appropriators to ignore the thousands of farmers waiting at 

the state level to make room for wildlife on their land,&quot; said 

Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife. &quot;The 

White House's rhetoric is very big on locally-led, voluntary 

conservation programs, but that sure didn't show up in their budget 

for these model initiatives.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;America's farmers are world leaders in agriculture, and they 

can be world leaders in conservation too -- if the President and 

Congress give them the support they need,&quot; said Jim Lyon, NWF's 

Senior Director for Legislative Affairs. &quot;These three initiatives, 

the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Wildlife Habitat Incentive 

Program and the Farmland Protection Program help keep America's 

water clean, conserve wildlife habitat and protect wetlands that 

are critical to wildlife and the people who depend on and enjoy 

it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate has the opportunity to restore funding for WRP, WHIP, 

and FPP either through an FY2001 supplemental currently before the 

Senate Agriculture Committee, or through the regular FY2002 

Agriculture Appropriations legislation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's no doubt that concerned Americans are making the most 

of these initiatives to create a place for wildlife on our 

country's farmlands, pastures and forest lands,&quot; continued Lyon. 

&quot;We mustn't deprive them of the federal help they need to continue 

this important conservation work.&quot; </font></p>
