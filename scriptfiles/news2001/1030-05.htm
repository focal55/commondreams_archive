<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  - October 30 - Eight major 

environmental organizations called today for the Senate to 

investigate whether the Interior Department is withholding 

scientific information critical to the congressional debate over 

whether to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil 

development. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to Sen. Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the 

Governmental Affairs Committee; Sen. Jim Jeffords, chairman of 

the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Rep. James 

Hansen, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, the 

organizations pointed to recent news reports that have raised 

serious questions about whether Congress has been fully informed 

on the issue now before the Senate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was signed by Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice 

Legal Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth, National Audubon 

Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, 

U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and The Wilderness Society. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington Post reported today that the U.S. Fish and 

Wildlife Service has warned in two internal reports that opening 

the Arctic refuge to oil development might violate an 

international agreement to protect polar bears. But the Post 

said those reports have never reached Congress. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;During the current heated debate in Congress over the 

future of the Arctic refuge, it is imperative for lawmakers and 

the public to have all the facts and a transparent process for 

evaluating the science. Yet this critical biological data still 

appears not to have been provided to Congress,&quot; the letter from 

the environmental organizations said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Late last week, four of these environmental organizations, 

including Defenders of Wildlife, asked the Senate to look into 

discrepancies in testimony given by Interior Secretary Gale 

Norton about the legislative proposal to drill for oil in the 

Arctic refuge. Norton has drawn criticism for Senate committee 

testimony in which she left out scientific data from the Fish 

and Wildlife Service showing that drilling would harm caribou. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington Post reported that Norton also added erroneous 

data that would have bolstered the case for drilling if it had 

been true. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These discrepancies raise serious questions regarding the 

scientific integrity of the Department's answers, and the 

process by which these answers were developed within the 

Department,&quot; the environmental organizations said in their 

letter to Lieberman, Jeffords and Hansen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defenders Vice President Robert Dewey said: &quot;It appears that 

when Secretary Norton says policy will be based on sound 

science, she really means science that sounds good to her. 

Members of Congress need the Secretary of the Interior to play 

straight with them on polar bears, caribou and other wildlife 

that would be harmed by drilling in the refuge, and it's not 

clear that she is.&quot; </font></p>
