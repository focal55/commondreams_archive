- January 16 - Statement of Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club

                       On Homestead Air Base Victory:

<p>

"The Sierra Club applauds the Clinton Administration for making the right

decision on the Homestead Air Base. For six years Sierra Club members in

South Florida have worked to ensure that our national parks are protected

from this commercial airport. By firmly rejecting a commercial airport plan

next to Everglades and Biscayne National Parks, the US Department of

Interior is standing up for all national parks and saying that developments

that threaten our precious wildlands are unacceptable.

<p>

"The legacy President Clinton leaves today will protect our nation's wild

lands forever.  With this landmark decision, President Clinton will be

remembered as a protector of the Everglades and of our nation's wildlands.

When you step into Everglades or Biscayne Bay National Parks, you will hear

the impact of today's decision -- peace and solitude rather than the roar

of jets screaming overhead.

<p>

"The people of South Florida are the real winners today. The President

heard their demand that no airport can be built on or near the property.

Requiring a mixed-use development is the right solution for South Florida

and for our nation. It will provide needed jobs for the region without

harming our environment and national parks.

<p>

"Unfortunately, the fight is not yet over. Private land use speculators who

hope to take private gain from the ruin of our national parks may sue. We

hope that they accept and support this decision, and we will fight for as

long as it takes to protect what belongs to the American people: our

national parks."
