- January 19 - Hundreds of Greens from Iowa,

Ohio, Maine, New York, and many other states will join

the D.C. Statehood Green Party in Washington, D.C. on

Saturday, January 20 for a day of protests and other

events in response to the inauguration of George W.

Bush after a national election subverted by election

irregularities. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Greens issued a statement voter

disenfranchisement in Florida and elsewhere on

Thursday, December 7 (appended below), which was

revised and adopted a few weeks later as a national

statement by the Association of State Green Parties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Implicit in Green participation in the

counter-inaugural events is a challenge to all

Americans distressed by the Florida election scandal. 

The protests, say Greens, are not about Al Gore vs.

George W. Bush, or about Democrats versus Republicans,

but about the continuing American struggle to achieve

democracy and about support for all those in Florida

and across the U.S. whose votes were hindered or

discounted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party (and other third parties and

dissenters of all stripes) recognized and suffered

assaults on democratic rights long before Florida --

prohibitive ballot access laws, exclusion of Ralph

Nader from the debates, corporate purchase and control

of major parties and candidates, brutal suppression of

protesters in Seattle and other demos,

disenfranchisement of people of color and the poor

(including exfelons and those who don't speak or read

English) -- for all of which Democrats as well as

Republicans are responsible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Part of this struggle is the movement for D.C.

self-determination.  The D.C. Statehood Green Party

rejects the call by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton for

&quot;virtual statehood,&quot; insisting that neither

Congressional representation nor limited autonomy in

themselves constitute genuine democracy.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only acceptable resolution to our lack of

constitutional rights, say D.C. Statehood Greens with

the enthusiastic support of the Green Party

nationally, is full statehood.  Green candidate Ralph

Nader held a Super Rally which drew 10,0000 people to

the MCI Arena in Washington, D.C. on November 5, with

D.C. statehood as the theme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Counter-Inauguration Day</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens will meet 10 a.m. at the Counter-Inaugural

rally, at Stanton Park in Northeast D.C., and at noon

march with counter-inaugural protesters organized by

Rev. Al Sharpton and the National Action Network to

the Supreme Court for the Counter-Inauguration

ceremony.  Greens will participate in various other

protests as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later in the afternoon, there will be a D.C. Statehood

Green Party reception and celebration for Charlie

Mason at the University of the District of Columbia

Auditorium from 2 - 5 pm, and many Greens will attend

the three counter-inaugural balls, organized by the

Justice Action Movement, on Saturday evening.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Charlie Mason was a co-founder of the D.C. Statehood

Party (merged with the D.C. Green Party since 1999)

and a long time supporter of the party, and is husband

of former D.C. Council member Hilda Mason.  (For more

D.C. Statehood Green Party: Statement on Voter

Disenfranchisement in the 2000 Election</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Passed by consensus, Thursday, December 7, 2000</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The D.C. Statehood Green Party calls for an

investigation of the alleged election irregularities

in Florida and other states, especially the alleged

disenfranchisement of many African Americans and other

people of color.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These include reports of intimidation and obstruction

by crowds and officials, lack of ballots and working

voting machines, refusal of assistance and foreign

language translation to voters, failure to process

registrations and ballots, and other errors and

omissions potentially affecting the rights of voters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The presidential election stalemate in Florida reveals

that voter fraud, manipulation, and intimidation

against African Americans may not have ended with

passage of civil rights laws, and sheds light on some

of the same practices used against Latinos, American

Indians, immigrants, and poor whites in some states. 

The D.C. Statehood Green Party condemns all such

assaults on the democratic rights of thousands of

voters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Green Party supports the demand of

the Congressional Black Caucus that the Justice

Department investigate these allegations as possible

violations of the constitutional rights of thousands

of Americans and as abuses of the 1965 Voting Rights

Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Green Party calls for the

investigation of allegations of disenfranchisement of

voters in the armed forces.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Green Party also condemns the

disenfranchisement of convicted felons, according to

the laws of certain states, which has resulted in the

ethnic engineering of elections.  The disproportionate

incarceration of people of color and the War on Drugs,

under which hundreds of thousands of Americans have

been imprisoned for minor and nonviolent offenses, are

monstrous injustices which must cease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Green Party demands that all

Americans convicted of felonies or any other offenses,

whether currently in prison or having served their

sentences, have their full voting rights restored.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Already on record opposing the War on Drugs, which

addresses drug use and addiction as a legal and

military crisis instead of a health issue, the D.C.

Statehood Green Party asks all Americans to recognize

the War on Drugs as a cruel and unjust tactic to

deprive millions of Americans, especially people of

color and the poor, of their constitutional rights,

including the right to vote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Green Party continues to demand

equitable redistricting, enactment of Instant Run-off

Voting and other election reforms, and closer

monitoring of elections.  The D.C. Statehood Green

Party takes no side in the current election stalemate

in Florida.&quot;
