- May 4 - On Tuesday, May 8 at 11 am, the Institute for America's Future

will join with Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Barbara Boxer, and Jon

Corzine, to release a new report, "Choosing the Wealthy Over

Children." The report finds that if Congress votes in favor of

President Bush's tax proposal, giving $555 billion in tax

reductions to the people earning over one million a year, America

will lack the resources to do anything significant to address the

needs of its poorest children.

<p>The report, compiled with the assistance of City Policy

Associates, outlines a ten-year investment strategy designed

show how the lives of poor children could be improved if the

$555 billion President Bush proposes to give as tax breaks to

the top one percent of income-earners over the next ten years

were instead spent on programs for children. "Bush ignores

the needs of America's children in order to give a wind-fall

tax return to the wealthiest of all Americans," said Roger Hickey,

Co-Director of the Institute. "We challenge the President --

and any Member of the Senate or House planning to vote for his

<br>

tax cuts -- to explain how they can claim there is surplus when

millions of children are raised in poverty, lack health care,

live in unsafe housing, and attend overcrowded schools that

are falling apart."

<p>The report will be released simultaneously by citizen groups in

several states, many in conjunction with the national grassroots

movement, Fair Taxes for All Coalition, to bring attention to the

pressing needs of children at the state and local level.
