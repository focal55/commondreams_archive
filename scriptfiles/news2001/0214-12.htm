- February 14 - Gene Kimmelman, 

  Co-Director of Consumers Union's Washington DC Office, made the following statement 

  today in response to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)'s annual report 

  on cable industry prices, which showed that both &quot;competitive&quot; and 

  &quot;noncompetitive&quot; cable operators increased rates by 5.8% in the twelve 

  months leading up to July 1, 2000:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Another day, another couple 

  of bucks on your cable bill. That's what happens when the government deregulates 

  a monopoly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;With the fifth anniversary 

  of the Telecommunications Act one week behind us, this report demonstrates why 

  policymakers need to require effective competition before deregulation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The FCC's analysis has consistently 

  shown that cable rates in communities with two cable operators in direct competition 

  are 20 percent lower than the rates in communities served by one operator. That 

  means that if communities nationwide had just two cable companies going head-to-head, 

  consumers would save more than $4 billion a year. Obviously, this report shows 

  that it's time for Congress and the FCC to clamp down on cable monopolies and 

  find new ways to jump-start competition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The FCC, as directed by Congress, separates cable operators into two categories 

  -- 'competitive' and 'noncompetitive.' These categories are not necessarily 

  what you would expect them to be. The 'competitive' category lumps cable operators 

  that have real head-to-head competition with the cable monopolies that sign 

  up less than 30 percent of their communities as subscribers. This is an artifact 

  of the '92 Cable Act and does not provide a meaningful comparison between competitive 

  and noncompetitive markets. The only way to truly compare the effect of competition 

  in the cable industry is to compare communities with one cable operator to those 

  with more than one.&quot;</font></p>
