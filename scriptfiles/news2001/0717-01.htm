- July 17 - Today a transnational 

alliance modeled after Jubilee 2000, the Global AIDS Alliance 

(GAA), challenged the G7 governments meeting in Genoa, Italy this 

weekend to take real action to stop global AIDS. The club of seven 

wealthiest nations, meeting on the Italian Riviera, are expected to 

discuss the Global AIDS and Health Fund, the AIDS epidemic and the 

status of debt relief efforts. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The fate of millions of lives in Africa and other areas rides 

on this meeting,&quot; commented David Bryden, spokesperson for the 

Global AIDS Alliance. &quot;People in impoverished, indebted nations, 

struggling to contain the AIDS crisis, cannot afford more empty 

rhetoric. The leaders at the Summit will discuss the state of the 

industrialized nations' economies -- but what about the economic 

impact on countries in Africa of AIDS and the still ridiculous 

levels of debt payments to the IMF and the World Bank? That should 

be a primary focus, the fate of over a billion people in 

impoverished countries. But will they have time to give this 

serious attention as they sip their Italian espressos?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Saturday, July 21, the Global AIDS Alliance will take part in 

a peaceful and non-violent march and rally sponsored by Drop the 

Debt. GAA and many other AIDS organizations are calling for deeper 

and broader debt relief as a means of freeing up scarce resources 

to fight the epidemic. Over 30 major AIDS, health care, 

development and religious organizations, including the Christian 

Children's Fund, have written to President Bush appealing to him to 

use the Genoa meeting to mandate full cancellation of debts owed 

the IMF and World Bank by the poorest nations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In Genoa we'll see if the G7 leaders accept distortions by the 

World Bank and the IMF about their ability to drop the debt,&quot; 

stated Bryden. &quot;As elected leaders they must exercise their 

responsibility and mandate these institutions to contribute their 

fair share.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The World Bank and IMF are the biggest remaining creditors to 

the poorest countries and independent accountants have confirmed 

they could write off 100 per cent of these debts without impeding 

their ability to function. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAA also challenged the G7 leaders to contribute billions 

more to fight the epidemic, to open the Global Fund design process 

to full, open participation, and to make sure recipients have the 

option of purchasing AIDS medicines from generic manufacturers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush and Members of Congress from both parties 

support billions of dollars in emergency US funding for purchasing 

armaments, while blocking Congressional efforts to provide billions 

to fight AIDS&quot; noted Bryden. &quot;We hope the Genoa meeting will be a 

turning point where the US will match its rhetoric about AIDS with 

action that reflects our tremendous wealth. AIDS needs real money, 

not pennies.&quot; </font></p>
