- January 2 - Adding to the anti-environmental picks of Norton and Ashcroft,

today President-elect Bush rounded out his cabinet with ousted

Michigan senator Spencer Abraham to head the Department of Energy.

Like Ashcroft, Abraham's record is entirely composed of

anti-environmental votes in the last congress, particularly in the

area of energy.

<p>Abraham voted to increase special subsidies to the oil industry,

and took positions against renewable energy and fuel efficiency

standards. Consistently siding with the oil and coal industries,

Abraham voted to open up the Arctic National Wildlife refuge to oil

exploration and to continue blowing apart mountains for coal in

violation of the Clean Water Act.

<p>"In today's press conference Bush urged the American public to

look at the nominee's records. We've done that. And we're here

to report that the records of Abraham and Ashcroft in the 106th

Congress have been complete environment zeroes," said Friends of

the Earth President Brent Blackwelder.

<p>"With the appointments of Abraham, Ashcroft and Norton, the Bush

cabinet is shaping up as a jobs program for recently defeated

anti-environmental zealots and recycled Reagan and Bush-era

industry friendly operatives."
