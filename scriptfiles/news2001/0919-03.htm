<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> WASHINGTON - September 19 -The Green Party of the United States urges President Bush, Secretary of

              State Colin Powell, and other American leaders to take seriously the plea from European heads of

              state and other leaders around the world not to launch a massive, indiscriminate strike against

              Afghanistan and perhaps other countries that will cause civilian deaths in vengeance for the terrible&nbsp;

              attacks launched against the United States on September 11. Instead, the U.S. must seek

              international cooperation in bringing those who incited and abetted this atrocity to justice and

              punishment according to international law.&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Green Party supports our nation's right to defend itself and its people," said Robert Franklin,

              Treasurer of the Green Party of the United States and a Texas Green. "But a massacre of civilians, in&nbsp;

              vengeful retaliation, will put us at the same level as the terrorists, will not eliminate the threat of the

              international network that perpetrated the attacks, will erode international sympathy for the U.S., and

              will encourage more people in Middle Eastern nations to join or support violent extremists. The best

              way to convert people to terrorism is to drop bombs on their families."&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

              Greens have condemned the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and U.S.

              airlines, mourned with other Americans over the tragic loss of life, and called for justice for the victims

              and punishment for the terrorists and those who support them. But Greens oppose the 'blank check'&nbsp;

              Congress gave President Bush to wage war at his administration's sole discretion.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Comparisons to the attack on Pearl Harbor are valid only to a point," said Sarah Davidson, secretary&nbsp;

              of the Peace Issues Committee of the Iowa Green Party. "Japan, as a nation state, was an obvious,

              geographically defined enemy. The September 11 terrorists apparently work as a secretive international

              network. France could not defeat the Algerian guerrillas who fought for independence; the

              United States'&nbsp; wrongful war in Vietnam caused millions of civilian deaths but failed against the Viet Cong.

              Last week's attackers represent a movement that will be even harder to crush, with its secret

              operatives dispersed internationally. Bombs and other technological warfare will slaughter the innocent,

              \ but will not defeat these criminals. International investigation

              and cooperation will."&nbsp;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There's a tendency, promoted by some warmongering op-ed columnists and irresponsible national

              officials, to call the terrorists 'religious fanatics,' 'evil,' with an unmotivated 'pathological hatred for&nbsp;

              American freedom and prosperity' without further context, as if the terrorists' attitudes and actions

              occurred in a historical vacuum," added Scott McLarty, a member of the D.C. Statehood Green Party

              and one of two national media coordinators for the Greens. "Bin Laden and his sympathizers don't call&nbsp;

              the U.S. 'Satan' because they're insane, but because they believe that Islamic society is already under

              attack by the U.S., and this is their fanatical response."&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

              

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">Greens warn that rash military strikes and a protracted war will result in thousands, perhaps millions

              more civilian casualties, including many Americans, leading to further attacks against the U.S. and

              other nations and to possible destabilization of a region that includes Pakistan, which owns nuclear

              weapons. The goal of U.S. policy, say Greens, must be peace with justice: peace which preserves the&nbsp;

              human rights and stability for all people in the Middle East, the U.S., and the rest of the world, and

              justice for those who have suffered death, injury, and loss.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">

              Punishment for the terrorists and their supporters must be waged within the Realpolitik of the Middle

              East: an ongoing 'war' and U.S.-imposed sanctions that have led to the deaths of hundreds of&nbsp;

              thousands of Iraqis (perhaps a half million children); the need for an engaged U.S.-sponsored peace

              policy aimed at resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict in a way that's perceived as fair to both sides and

              that sets out a 'road to peace' which recognizes both Israeli security and Palestinian human rights and

              self-determination; and broad, popular opposition in the Middle East to repressive regimes and

              transnational corporate interests that violate fundamental  norms of international law and basic human&nbsp;

              rights.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">

              This will take enormous political and moral courage," said Nancy Allen, a member of the Maine Green

              Independent Party and also a national media coordinator for the Greens. "But it's the only way we'll&nbsp;

              achieve a resolution. The alternative is too horrible to imagine."</font>                             </p>
