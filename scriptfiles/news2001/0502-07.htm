- May 2 - Investors holding 83.3 

million shares of  PepsiCo, Inc. (Ticker: PEP), worth 3.7 

billion dollars, voted to support a shareholder resolution 

on recycling at the company's annual meeting today in 

Plano, Texas. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Investor sponsors of the PepsiCo shareholder recycling 

proposal called the 8.1 percent 'yes' vote today an 

excellent result,&quot; said Lance King, spokesman for the 

environmental groups supporting the shareholder 

recycling proposal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;PepsiCo's board and management graciously listened to 

all our speakers.  Hopefully the company will take the 

strong shareholder message to heart and begin to examine 

ways to improve its recycling practices by setting specific 

goals,&quot; Bill Sheehan, network coordinator for the 

GrassRoots Recycling Network, said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Supporters of the recycling resolution secured enough 

support to bring the proposal back again next year, 

according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 

rules governing shareholder proposals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kenneth Scott, representing Walden Asset Management 

and Domini Social Investments, co-sponsors of the 

shareholder resolution, made the presentation in support 

of the shareholder recycling proposal (Item Number 6).   

The non-binding proposal calls for PepsiCo, Inc. to 

achieve two specific recycling goals by January 1, 2005:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot;	Make plastic bottles with 25 percent recycled 

plastic; and

&middot;	Take steps to achieve an 80 percent recycling rate 

for Coke bottles and cans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental leaders speaking in support of the 

proposal included:  Pat Franklin of the

Container Recycling Institute; Bill Sheehan for the 

GrassRoots Recycling Network; Bob Woodall of Waste 

Not Georgia; and, Molly Rooke, a Dallas-based leader in 

the local Sierra Club.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- more -</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Recycling rates dropped dramatically in recent years, 

largely due to the proliferation of throwaway beverage 

packaging.  Plastic bottles are the fastest growing type of 

bottle and can waste.  Three out of four plastic soda, 

juice, water and sports drink bottles go to landfills or 

incinerators,&quot; said Pat Franklin, executive director of the 

nonprofit Container Recycling Institute, based in 

Arlington, Virginia.</font></p>

<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The key to eliminating waste and increasing 

recycling is creating an effective financial incentive, 

which is why states with refundable deposits on 

beverages average an 80 percent recycling rate,&quot; Franklin 

said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sheehan presented a letter in support of the shareholder 

resolution on recycling,

addressed to the PepsiCo Board of Directors, and signed 

by 98 public officials, businesses, environmental 

organizations, student and community leaders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bob Woodall,  executive director of Waste Not Georgia, 

said after the vote:  &quot;Litter is a

key issue for many people across Georgia and the nation.  

States with deposit laws are much cleaner than states 

without.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Molly Rooke, a leader in the Dallas area Sierra Club, told 

PepsiCo leadership: &quot;Stop messing with Texas.  Pepsi is 

lagging behind the industry leader, Coca-Cola, and needs 

to become a leader in recycling. Stop spending money 

lobbying against bottle bills.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Institutional investors co-sponsoring the shareholder 

recycling resolution called upon PepsiCo to stop 

opposing bottle bills or come up with another method to 

achieve the 80 percent recycling rate, which is the current 

average in states with refundable deposits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The vote today assures shareholders that recycling will 

stay on the agenda in discussions between investors and 

top management at PepsiCo.  The resolution can be 

brought back again next year,&quot; King said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Coca-Cola CEO Doug Daft announced on April 18 that 

his company is working to use 10 percent recycled plastic 

in making new bottles by 2005.  While it less than what 

Coke does in other nations, it puts them far ahead of 

Pepsi.  Daft also said Coke will work with a multi-

stakeholder group, called BEAR, exploring means to 

increase recycling,&quot; Sheehan noted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Perhaps PepsiCo will join the multi-stakeholder group, 

comprised of businesses and environmentalists seeking to 

roughly double the national recycling rate,&quot; said Sheehan.</font></p>
