- July 18 - Continuing to stress the 

need for stronger and timelier implementation of clean air 

safeguards, Earthjustice today filed the third of seven lawsuits 

challenging the federal government's chronic failure to protect 

Americans from the health hazards of toxic air pollution. 

Representing Sierra Club, Earthjustice is filing one lawsuit each 

day for a week, to compel EPA to do its job. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's lawsuit focuses specifically on supertoxins -- dioxins, 

PCBs, and mercury as well as four other pollutants that Congress 

singled out for especially careful regulation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In 1990, Congress put a shortlist of seven supertoxins in the 

Clean Air Act,&quot; said Earthjustice attorney James Pew. &quot;All seven 

share characteristics that make them especially dangerous. First, 

even in extremely low doses they can cause a wide variety of 

horrible health effects, including cancer and birth defects. 

Second, they persist almost indefinitely in the environment. Third, 

they bioaccumulate in the foodchain, so that relatively low levels 

in the environment can translate into high levels in certain types 

of fish, dairy products, and meat.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once emitted, these pollutants contaminate the environment for 

decades,&quot; said Dr. Bob Palzer, chair of Sierra Club's Air 

Committee. &quot;It's time to get them under control so we can start 

cleaning up and reducing the risk. Until we do, people are likely 

to get seriously sick as a result of our inaction.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The seven pollutants, listed in the Clean Air Act, are alkylated 

lead compounds, polycyclic organic matter, hexachlorobenzene, 

mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 

2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofurans and 

2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (collectively referred to as 

dioxins). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By November 2000, EPA was required to complete regulations 

assuring that the sources emitting 90 percent of the supertoxins 

were subject to emission standards with respect to those 

pollutants,&quot; pointed out Pew. &quot;But it hasn't done so. In fact, for 

three of the seven pollutants, including PCBs, EPA has yet to 

require any controls at all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On behalf of Sierra Club, Earthjustice filed suit in the United 

States District Court for the District of Columbia. </font></p>
