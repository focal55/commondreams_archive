- July 19 - Capping a successful first seven months of

organizing, Campus Greens will hold its founding

convention at The University of Illinois at Chicago,

August 9-12.  An estimated 500 students from 150

schools are expected to attend.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The convention will consist of issue, identity, and

skill-building workshops, panel discussions on the

future of the Green Party and progressive politics, a

plenary session that will determine national

organizing strategy, a major rally open to the public,

and a direct action for affordable housing organized

in coordination with the Rodgers Park Action Network

and other progressive Chicago-based organizations. 

Ralph Nader, Winona LaDuke, Medea Benjamin, Jello

Biafra, Mike Feinstein, Patti Smith and countless

other Green Party and progressive activists will

participate in the convention.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We plan on using this convention to help young Green

Party activists build the skills they need to help

build the Green Party, and to directly address

questions of how the Green Party can position itself

as the party of the progressive left, particularly on

issues of poverty and racial justice,&#148; Development

Coordinator Lauren Schwartz (Columbia, '04) said

today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campus Greens was founded in the wake of last

November&#146;s election by students involved with the

historic Students for Nader/LaDuke effort.  Its

mission is to engage members of campus communities in

Green and progressive third-party politics -&#151; as

activists, campaign workers, and candidates.  The

Campus Greens national office is currently located in

Madison, WI, where twelve college students are working

as staff or full-time volunteers to organize the

founding convention and lay the groundwork for a

sustainable national organization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Students made up the bulk of support for the Green

Party in last year&#146;s campaign,&#148; Field Organizer Brian

Sandberg (UMass, &#146;01) said today.  &#147;Our emergence,

together with the likely formation of the Green Party

of the United States later this month, gives the Green

Party the institutional structure it needs to grow and

grow fast.&#148;</font></p>

convention from your area of the country, contact
