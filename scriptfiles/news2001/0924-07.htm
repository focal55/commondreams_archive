<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Pentagon seems to be saying that lesbian and gay soldiers are welcome to put themselves in the line of fire, but if they live through combat they won't have jobs when they return,&quot; said National Organization for Women (NOW) Executive Vice President Karen Johnson, a retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A &quot;stop-loss&quot; order on discharges was also issued during the Persian Gulf War in 1991, but those whose sexual orientation was disclosed during that period faced removal after the war. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NOW continues to call for a permanent end to the ban on lesbians and gays in the military, including an end to the failed 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, in the hope that future veterans will not be cast aside after they have served their country during its greatest need,&quot; Johnson continued. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In this time of national tragedy and a war on terrorism, our military's top brass recognizes the value of our lesbian and gay service members,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;As they fight the war on terrorism, NOW calls on the U.S. military to fight the war on hate and intolerance by honoring those who serve -- in peace as well as in war.&quot;  </font></p>
