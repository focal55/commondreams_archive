- May 1 - As the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank

 convene for their Spring Meetings in Washington, DC, Congresswoman Cynthia

 McKinney released a letter to Secretary Treasury O'Neill calling on the

 Treasury Department to use its influence with the International Monetary

 Fund and the World Bank to stop these institutions from undermining

 Mozambique's cashew nut processing industry.

 

<p>The letter, signed by twenty-one Members of Congress, asserts that "the

 IMF's continued obstruction of Mozambique's democratically determined

 economic development policies" is an "abuse of the authority and resources

 granted to the IMF by the United States."  The letter asks O'Neill "to

 instruct the United States Executive Directors at the IMF and the World

 Bank

 to communicate that it is the policy of the United States that the IMF and

 the World Bank should cease obstructing Mozambique's efforts to

 rehabilitate

 its cashew industry."

 

<p>The controversial policy of the two institutions in Mozambique was the

 subject of an article in September in the Washington Post. The IMF and the

 World Bank have insisted that the cashew nut industry, once one of the

 largest private sector employers, be dismantled as a condition of debt

 relief and new loans.

 

<p>"It's ludicrous that the World Bank and the IMF are imposing poverty and 

 joblessness and dependency on the Mozambican people.  It's long past time

 for 

 Congress to assert its authority over U.S. policy at these institutions," 

 McKinney said today. "It's outrageous that these institutions, largely

 funded 

 by the U.S. taxpayer, impose misguided economic policies on developing 

 countries that have never been approved or even debated by the U.S.

 Congress."

 

 

 

<p>April 26, 2001

 

<p>Mr. Paul H. O'Neill

 Secretary

 Department of the Treasury

 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

 Washington, DC 20220

 

<p>Dear Secretary O'Neill:

 

<p>As you are no doubt aware, in the last several years Members of Congress

 on

 both sides of the aisle have become increasingly dissatisfied with the

 policies promoted and imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the

 World Bank in developing countries, using U.S. tax dollars.

 

<p>One particular case stands out: for the last several years, the IMF and

 the

 World Bank have undermined Mozambique's efforts to rehabilitate its cashew

 nut processing industry. As a result, thousands of workers have lost their

 jobs in an industry that was once one of the largest private sector

 employers. Production has shifted to India, which uses child labor to

 shell

 the nuts. Ironically, the United States is a major market for processed

 cashew, so that as a result of the IMF/World Bank intervention, U.S.

 consumers are subsidizing child labor. For years the World Bank persisted

 in

 pressuring Mozambique to remove support for its cashew industry, despite

 opposition to the World Bank policy by Mozambique's democratically elected

 parliament and despite the fact that a study commissioned by the World

 Bank

 indicated that the World Bank's policy was unsound.

 

<p>Last year, the new head of the IMF, Horst Kohler, promised that IMF

 policies

 would change, that the IMF would stop imposing policies on developing

 countries that have nothing to do with the IMF's core mission.

 Unfortunately, like so much rhetoric in the past concerning "reform" at

 the

 international financial institutions, it is far from clear that the change

 in rhetoric has been matched by a change in reality. Recent reports

 indicate

 that the IMF is still pressuring Mozambique to remove support for its

 cashew

 industry.

 

<p>We regard the IMF's continued obstruction of Mozambique's democratically

 determined economic development policies to be an abuse of the authority

 and

 resources granted to the IMF by the United States. We ask you to instruct

 the United States Executive Directors at the IMF and the World Bank to

 communicate that it is the policy of the United States that the IMF and

 the

 World Bank should cease obstructing Mozambique's efforts to rehabilitate

 its

 cashew industry.

 

<p>Sincerely,
