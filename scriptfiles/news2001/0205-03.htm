- February 5 - The National Women's Law

Center is analyzing President Bush's tax plan this week to determine

how it affects women and their families in particular. Initial

analysis shows that both the size and the distribution of the

proposed tax cuts present concerns for women.

<p>"The size of this proposed tax cut poses a serious threat to

Social Security, Medicare and other safety net programs, including

the need to make increased investments in areas critical to women and

their families such as education, child care and health care. Women

have a greater stake in these federal programs because they tend to

earn less during their lifetimes and are more likely to bear the

burden of uncompensated family care-taking responsibilities," said

NWLC Co-President Nancy Duff Campbell.

<p>Campbell added that NWLC will also be watching closely to see how

the distribution of the plan affects different kinds of women, such

as single heads of households, women in the paid labor force, and

older women.

<p>"We are concerned that the tax rate cuts announced today are not

sufficiently tilted toward middle- and low-income families. For

example, the rate cut changes provide no benefit to the lowest-income

families, so many of whom are headed by women. If there is to be a

tax cut, it should help these families most in need, such as by

making the child tax credit refundable or increasing the earned

income tax credit," said Campbell.

<p>Campbell has almost 30 years' experience in tax law and policy,

especially at it pertains to women and their families. She serves on

the board of the Community Tax Law Report and chaired the national

Coalition on Women and Taxes during the 1986 tax reform debates.

<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-partisan, non-profit

organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect

women's legal rights. NWLC focuses on major policy areas of

importance to women and their families including economic security,

education, employment and health, with special attention given to the

concerns of low-income women. </i>
