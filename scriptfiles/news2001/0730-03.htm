- July 30 - The Sierra Club welcomed the findings of the National

Academy of Sciences that technology exists to safely improve the fuel

economy of cars and light trucks, but said the industry-weighted panel's

report does not go far enough.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report released today identifies

technologies that can significantly improve Corporate Average Fuel Economy

(CAFE) Standards over the next decade, but largely ignores a range of

technologies that would make even greater improvements, such as high

strength lightweight materials, improved aerodynamics and better tires.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report is a triple for the environment, not a home run,&quot; said Daniel

Becker, Director of Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy Program. &quot;Even

this industry-friendly panel says we can move forward to increase fuel

economy with existing technologies that will curb global warming, save

consumers money at the gas pump, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club also praised the NAS finding that the &quot;The car/truck

distinction has been stretched well beyond the original purpose.&quot;  Current

law holds SUVs and other light trucks to a much weaker fuel economy

standard, and it is time to close this &quot;light truck loophole.&quot; Congress

will have the opportunity to close this loophole later this week with an

amendment to the Energy Advancement and Conservation Act of 2001.  The

Sierra Club is running targeted radio ads asking Representatives to vote to

close the loophole.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The panel also recognized that raising CAFE standards is important to

reducing global warming and our dependence on foreign oil, stating that

without CAFE standards the U.S. would be consuming an additional 2.8

million barrels of oil daily.  Additionally, the panel found that improving

fuel economy standards with existing technology does not have to affect the

safety or performance of the vehicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;History shows that while the auto industry doubled car fuel economy in the

1970's and 1980's, the rate of traffic fatalities fell by half,&quot; added

Becker.  &quot;Better engines, transmissions and improved aerodynamics could

safely improve fuel economy today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NAS panel does make several concessions to the auto-industry, and

ignores a larger range of technologies that would make even greater

improvements to fuel economy. The New York Times described the NAS panel as

consisting &quot;mainly of engineers and consultants who have worked for the

auto and oil industries, along with some economists and retired oil

executives.  It does not include anyone from the environmental movement.&quot;

The New York Times also reported that the panel weakened its report under

auto industry pressure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even this industry-friendly report says we can provide what Americans

want: cars and SUVs that go farther on a gallon of gas, save money and

slash pollution,&quot; said Ann Mesnikoff, Sierra Club Washington

Representative. &quot;Congress can immediately act on the NAS recommendations by

voting this week to close the &quot;light truck loophole.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Importantly, the panel recommends ending the dual fuel vehicle loophole

which allows auto makers to garner credits toward meeting CAFE standards by

making vehicles that can, but never do, run on alternative fuels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Updated fuel economy standards are an essential part of a balanced and

effective national energy policy.  Cars and light trucks alone consume 40

percent of the oil used in the US - approximately 8 million barrels per

day.  CAFE standards for cars have stagnated for more than a decade and the

standards for popular SUVs has gone virtually unchanged for 20 years.  The

average fuel economy of new passenger vehicles sold in 2000 sank to its

lowest point since 1980.
