- February 27 - In a letter sent today to Senate and House Democrats, Council for a Livable

World criticized Democrats who are advocating military budget increases

beyond the level to be proposed by President Bush.<br>

	<br>

The overall Bush budget numbers are slated to be released February 28.

Advance reports suggest that Bush will propose to retain the last budget

proposed by President Clinton, $310 billion for the Pentagon alone and

about $322 - $324 billion for defense including Energy Department nuclear

weapons spending.<br>

	<br>

Some Democrats have chosen to go to the right of the Bush Administration.

On February 13, Rep. Norm Dicks (D-WA) and five colleagues introduced a

defense supplemental appropriations bill for $6.7 billion despite the

Administration's present review that will determine the shape and role of

the military over the next few years.<br>

	<br>

On February 17, Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) used the Democratic radio

address to charge that: &quot;His [Bush] plan will undermine national defense to

pay for excessive tax cuts.&quot;  Sen. Mary Landrieu, in a February 21 letter,

urged President Bush to consider a $5 - $10 billion supplemental defense bill.<br>

 	<br>

The Council, an organization advocating a sensible military budget, stated

that: &quot;We are appalled that leading members of the Democratic Party

advocate increasing that budget.&quot;  The letter continued: &quot;The Democratic

Party has traditionally fought for social and domestic programs such as

health care, civil rights enforcement and the environment.  Those who

benefit from, and believe in, these programs are the pillars of the

Democratic Party.  Committing the party to supporting massive increases in

military spending will jeopardize these programs.&quot;  <br>

	<br>

The letter pointed out that the budget to be released tomorrow represents

an increase from fiscal year 2001 of about $14 billion.  It pointed out

that the new budget will be almost 95 percent of the Cold War average and

greater than the military budgets of the next 12 nations combined.<br>

	<br>

The Council outlined a number of ways to create a stronger military without

increasing the budget, including closing unnecessary bases, removing &quot;buy

American&quot; provisions in spending bills, canceling Cold War era weapons such

as the F-22 fighter jet, V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Crusader

mobile howitzer, eliminating inter-service duplication and straightening

out its accounting.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, on February 13, Republican Senator Charles Grassley stated:&quot;Ramping up the Pentagon budget when the books are a mess is highly

questionable at best. To some it might seem crazy.&quot;<br>

	<br>

The Council letter concluded: &quot;Addressing wasteful Pentagon practices will

provide more than enough funding for necessary defense programs.

Significant increases in defense spending may jeopardize many important

domestic programs.  Council for a Livable World strongly urges Senators and

Representatives to refrain from calling for increases in military spending;

it's too high now.&quot;</font></p>
