- January 30 - A coalition of environmental groups, investors, 

            religious organizations, and indigenous peoples announced today the 

            filing of an Arctic National Wildlife Refuge shareholder resolution 

            with BP Amoco, the largest player in Alaska. The coalition called 

            on BP Amoco and its shareholders to respect the wilderness values 

            found in the Arctic Refuge, and review plans to drill for oil and 

            gas in the area.

<p align="left"> "BP Amoco and their allies in the Bush Administration 

            want to ruin one of the planet’s last wild places for less than six 

            months worth of oil and gas," said Athan Manuel, director of the Public 

            Interest Research Group’s (PIRG) Arctic Wilderness campaign. "The 

            best way for BP to go ‘beyond petroleum’ is to cancel drilling plans 

            for the Arctic Refuge - America’s Arctic - support wilderness for 

            the coastal plain, and go solar instead." </p>

          <p align="left">Thirteen percent of BP Amoco shareholders voted in favor 

            of a similar Arctic Refuge resolution, supported by PIRG, Greenpeace, 

            and Trillium Asset Management, at last year’s annual general meeting. 

            Those three groups are joined this year by Walden Asset Management 

            of Boston, the Green Century Balanced Fund, World Wildlife Fund, Sierra 

            Club, Free The Planet! and members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate 

            Responsibility. </p>

          <p align="left">The state PIRGs' national lobbying office, U.S. PIRG, 

            is coordinating a corporate campaign targeting the four oil companies 

            that have expressed interest in drilling in the Arctic Refuge. </p>

          <p align="left">"The national debate to protect the Arctic Refuge is 

            becoming more intense week by week and is a top priority for the environmental 

            community. Protecting our fragile environment is a priority for many 

            investors as well," said Timothy Smith, Senior Vice-president of Walden 

            Asset Management. "Thus we are issuing this urgent appeal to BP Amoco 

            to review their plans to drill. As President Clinton stated on January 

            17, 2001 - ‘We must continue to safeguard the Arctic National Wildlife 

            Refuge, one of the last truly wild places on earth . . . the Serengeti 

            of the Americas.’”</p>

          <p align="left"> The resolution was drafted by U.S. PIRG, Trillium Asset 

            Management, and Walden representatives, who then reached out to gather 

            the 100 shareholders to file the resolution with BP Amoco. Among the 

            more than 100 shareholders are the Green Century Balanced Fund, Greenpeace, 

            World Wildlife Fund, Sierra Club, United Methodist General Board on 

            Church and Society, United Church of Christ, Mercy Consolidated Asset 

            Management Program, Ethical Funds of Vancouver, British Columbia, 

            Catholic Healthcare West, Hampshire College, Oxfam USA, Oneida Tribe 

            of Indians of Wisconsin, Tides Foundation, Unitarian Universalist 

            Service Committee, and the As You Sow Foundation. </p>

          <p align="left">"BP Amoco represents one of the largest energy holdings 

            in our portfolio," said Simon Billenness, Senior Analyst with Trillium 

            Asset Management in Boston. "As ethical investors, we expect BP Amoco 

            to honor its promise to move 'beyond petroleum' and leave the Arctic 

            Refuge and the Gwich'in alone." </p>

          <p align="left">The Arctic shareholder resolution calls on BP Amoco 

            “to prepare a report on the impact of oil and gas drilling on the 

            coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to be available 

            to investors and the public by September 2001.” The report should 

            include an assessment of the potential damage to the ecosystem of 

            the coastal plain, to the Porcupine River Caribou herd, and to the 

            human rights of the Gwich’in Indians, that would result from the company 

            drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and 

            asks BP Amoco to include a summary of the research and positions taken 

            by major environmental organizations in the United States and the 

            United Kingdom on these issues. </p>

          <p align="left">In November 2000, BP Amoco CEO John Browne stated that 

            the company would like to drill in the coastal plain if George W. 

            Bush, who supports drilling for the Arctic Refuge, was elected president. 

            In June 1998, BP Amoco, Chevron, and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation 

            (ASRC) finalized a lease for oil exploration and development in the 

            coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. </p>

          <p align="left">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last 

            pristine areas left in the United States. Caribou, muskoxen, wolves, 

            polar, brown and black bears, and hundreds of thousands of migratory 

            birds rely on the wilderness habitat that the Refuge provides. The 

            Gwich'in people, Alaska natives who live near the Refuge, depend on 

            the caribou. For 20,000 years, their culture and way of life have 

            been intimately bound up with the Porcupine River caribou herd.</p>

          <p align="left"> "The breadth of the shareholders sponsoring the resolution, 

            from religious organizations to OXFAM, from Hampshire College to socially 

            concerned money managers, is testimony to the depth of concern in 

            America today regarding protecting the Arctic," said Kris Curtis, 

            Treasurer of the Green Century Balanced Fund. </p>

          <p align="left">Trillium Asset Management, Greenpeace, and U.S. PIRG 

            have also filed a climate change resolution with BP Amoco asking the 

            company to report to its shareholders on how and when it intends to 

            move away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy in response to 

            climate change. BP Amoco shareholders will vote on the resolutions 

            at their annual general meeting on April 19, 2001 in London. Similar 

            Arctic Refuge resolutions have been filed with ExxonMobil and Chevron.
