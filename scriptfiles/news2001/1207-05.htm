- December 7 - Earlier today in Geneva, U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton deliberately wrecked the 5th Review Conference of the 

Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention (BWC). Only yesterday, 

Bolton told the Conference that the United States would allow the 

continuation of negotiations for a new enhancement mechanism for 

the BWC. Today, one hour before the Conference was to end, Bolton 

reversed that position. This forced a suspension of the Review 

Conference until November 2002. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This reversal so shocked delegates that a European Union (EU) 

representative referred to the U.S. delegation as &quot;liars&quot;, and said 

that in &quot;decades of multilateral negotiations, we've never 

experienced this kind of insulting behavior.&quot; The EU nations, 

including staunch U.S. ally Great Britain, then boycotted a meeting 

of the Western Group of States Parties to the BWC saying they had 

&quot;been treated like dirt.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Since the Anthrax letter attacks, biological weapons are 

recognized as a major threat to U.S. and global security,&quot; said 

Martin Butcher, director of security programs for Physicians for 

Social Responsibility (PSR). &quot;Negotiating an enforcement mechanism 

would have been a major step forward in preventing the spread and 

use of these dreadful weapons of mass destruction. In killing the 

talks, the administration puts Americans at risk&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Review Conference had agreed to continue negotiations for an 

inspection and enforcement regime for the Treaty, already underway 

for seven years. The United States was alone in opposing the draft 

enforcement mechanism before the Review Conference. As early as 

July, U.S. Ambassador Donald Mahley announced that the Bush 

administration would not sign the protocol for the Biological 

Weapons Convention. The 1972 BWC bans biological weapons but 

provides no mechanism for enforcing the ban. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the need for primary prevention as a first line 

of defense, PSR also supports administration and Congressional 

efforts to strengthen the public health infrastructure necessary to 

respond to a biological weapons attack. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The administration is being hypocritical,&quot; Butcher said. &quot;They 

claim to be fighting the menace of biological weapons, but are 

walking away from a treaty that would further that goal. They are 

preparing a public health response to an attack, but blocking 

diplomatic initiatives that could prevent one.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interviews with PSR speakers are available on request. </font></p>
