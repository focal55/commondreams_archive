<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - August 22 - Amid growing public concern in the U.S. over the policies 

of the World Bank and IMF, the city council of Boulder, Colorado expressed 

its opposition to environmentally harmful World Bank policies late Tuesday 

night by unanimously passing a resolution by a 5-0 margin which commits the 

city not to invest in World Bank bonds. The Boulder council also passed a 

resolution opposing the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Mayor of Boulder, Will Toor, said, &quot;When we looked at the Bank's record 

of lending for large dams and their lending for fossil fuel projects, we 

found that the Bank's efforts to reform have not yet been sufficient. Given 

the environmental threats facing the globe, we stated that we would not buy 

World Bank bonds until the Bank fundamentally reconsiders its environmental 

policies and practices.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In just the past two months, four major institutional investors have joined 

the growing World Bank Bonds Boycott campaign, including the American 

Federation of Government Employees, a 600,000 member public sector union; 

the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, with 60 local unions in 

the states of California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii; the 

Unitarian Universalist General Assembly, comprised of over 1,000 churches; 

and the Sisters of the Holy Cross, an international congregation of women 

religious. In addition, the Midstate Central Labor Council (Ithaca, NY) and 

Pax Christi USA have adopted the boycott.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Francoise Poinsatte, a member of the Boulder city council, said, 

&quot;Structural adjustment programs instituted by the World Bank have 

contributed to a loss of social services, health, nutritional, and 

educational programs that are greatly needed in developing countries. By 

adopting the boycott, the city of Boulder is taking a stand to invest for 

not only financial purposes but with a goal of furthering social and 

environmental justice around the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign, modeled on the anti-Apartheid divestment movement, is causing 

the Bank serious concern. High-level World Bank officials attempted to 

dissuade members of the Boulder council from passing the resolution by 

sending several lengthy e-mails to city officials, including a 12-page 

position paper. World Bank officials have lobbied city council members 

against boycott initiatives in Madison, Wisconsin and in Los Angeles, 

California as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Boulder city council joins the cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and 

Berkeley, California, and Takoma Park, Maryland; 12 unions; 7 religious 

institutions; and 10 investment firms in making a commitment not to buy 

World Bank bonds.  The campaign was recently launched in Europe, and there 

are growing World Bank Bonds Boycott initiatives in Australia, Africa, 

Asia, Central America, and the Caribbean.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The one-year-old World Bank Bonds Boycott campaign organizes institutional 

investors to stop buying World Bank bonds as a means of putting political 

and financial pressure on the World Bank for fundamental change. The 

boycott demands that the World Bank Group cancel 100% of debts owed to it 

by impoverished countries, stops destructive 'structural adjustment' and 

similar policies, and ends all lending for oil, gas, and mining projects 

and all support for environmentally harmfulprojects such as dams that 

include forcedrelocation of people.</font></p>
