- April 19 -  "Today, Big Pharma

capitulated in the face of worldwide outrage," said James Love,

director of the Consumer Project on Technology, in response to

news that the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association of South

Africa (PMA) and 39 multinational brand-name drug corporations

would drop their suit against the government of South Africa.

<p>"Now is the time for the South African government to issue

compulsory licenses for HIV/AIDS drugs to generic

manufacturers," said Robert Weissman, co-director of Essential

Action. Compulsory licensing permits generic competition for

on-patent products. "By authorizing generic competition, South

Africa will see prices fall dramatically and steadily, and will

enable those with HIV/AIDS to gain access to the medicines they

need to survive."

<p>"The South African government deserves enormous credit for

withstanding over the last several years massive pressure from

the Clinton-Gore administration, the European Union and the drug

companies themselves," Love said. "Other countries in Africa and

the developing world have benefitted greatly from the South

African efforts," Love said.

<p>"The case was about U.S.-style generic substitution and

European-style parallel importing, and whether African countries

can do what countries in the North have done for years," Love

said.

<p>"The next step involves something that was not really

resolved in the court case," Love said, "which is whether South

African can and will proceed with compulsory licensing of cheap

generics to the African market. Unless the South African

government authorizes compulsory licensing on patents, people

who live in South Africa will not get access to dollar-a-day

AIDS cocktails. Nothing that happened today is sufficient to

make that happen."

<p>"The brand name drug companies must once and for all get out

of the way of efforts to deliver life-saving medicines to people

in South Africa," Weissman added.

<p><i>The Consumer Project on Technology and Essential Action are

both Ralph Nader-founded advocacy groups.
