Fails to Assure Safety of All Kids&#146; Drugs<br>

- July 30 - On Wednesday (Aug. 1), the Senate Health, Education, Labor and

Pensions Committee will take up legislation sponsored by Sens. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) and

Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) that gives drug companies a six-month extension on their lucrative

monopoly patents just for testing the safety of such drugs in children. Dodd&#146;s

legislation, however, fails to assure that <i>all</i> drugs likely to be used in children

will be tested for safety prior to marketing.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monopoly extensions first were made available to drug companies in exchange for testing

in children by legislation sponsored by Dodd and enacted in 1997. The new legislation

&#150; the &quot;Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act,&quot; S. 838 &#150; would continue

the practice of granting what is known as &quot;pediatric exclusivity&quot; to the drug

companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer advocates have been appealing to Dodd to address the higher costs for drugs

that his legislation would impose on already-overburdened consumers, particularly the

elderly. They also have asked Dodd to support changes to the bill that would assure that

all drugs likely to be used in children are first tested for safety.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pediatric exclusivity gives a windfall to the prescription drug industry. The U.S. Food

and Drug Administration (FDA) has estimated that the six months of pediatric exclusivity

that would be granted for hundreds of drugs over the next 20 years, as their patents

expire, would increase brand-name drug company sales by $29 billion. The cost to consumers

would be an additional $14 billion over that time because access to lower-priced generics

would be delayed six months. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The profits enjoyed by the drug companies from the patent extensions greatly exceed the

cost of conducting the studies, a Public Citizen <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/drugs/pedexclusivityfactsheet.html" target="new">analysis</a>

shows. The FDA estimates that drug companies will reap $592 million in additional

annual profits under pediatric exclusivity. It also estimates that the annual cost of

conducting studies if they had been required between 1993 and 1997 was only $80 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If senators want to assure that drugs are tested before they are given to

children, they should support legislation that requires this testing to be done as a

condition of FDA&#146;s approval of drugs,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch. &quot;This would be the courageous approach. But it

requires the Senate to stand up to the drug industry. It is also the only solution that

puts the burden for the safety of drugs where it should be, squarely on the shoulders of

the drug industry, the most profitable industry in the nation, rather than on the backs of

consumers.&quot;</font>

</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, the 11 biggest brand name drug manufacturers made $28 billion

in profits, prompting <i>Fortune</i> magazine to once again rank the drug industry as the

most profitable in America. During the 1990s, the average profits of the Fortune 500 drug

companies have been three to four times the average profits of all Fortune 500 industries.

</font></p>



<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the key problems with the Dodd-DeWine bill:



</font>

<ul>

  

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It fails to ensure that drugs likely to be prescribed to children will be tested in

    children before being prescribed for their use. Public Citizen analysis of FDA documents

    reveals that the current law, to which the Dodd bill makes only minor modifications, will

    leave many drugs important for children untested.</font></li>

</ul>

<ul>

  

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It doesn&#146;t guarantee that companies will make the results of their studies known

    through the labeling changes necessary for drugs to be used safely and effectively in

    children.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, the FDA issued a rule that would require testing for all <u>new</u>

drugs that are likely to be used by &quot;a substantial number of children,&quot; or that

would provide &quot;meaningful therapeutic benefit&quot; to children. But enforcement of

the rule has been blocked by litigation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen endorses the FDA&#146;s proposal and believes that pediatric exclusivity

for new drugs should be ended and that drug companies should be required to test new drugs

for use in children as a condition of getting FDA approval to market their product. For

drugs already on the market, Congress should give the FDA authority to require testing and

end the six months of additional patent protection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s bad enough giving drug companies a huge windfall for something that

should be required as part of the FDA drug approval process,&quot; Clemente said.

&quot;What&#146;s worse is that after consumers pay out an extra $14 billion for pediatric

exclusivity, many of the drugs most needed by children will remain untested.</font></p>

<font FACE="Times New">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some advocates for children support the pediatric exclusivity incentive out of

frustration and desperation, fearing that drug companies would conduct no pediatric tests

without a hefty financial reward. This attitude makes it easy for members of Congress to

support S. 838. Senators may see a vote for the Dodd-DeWine bill, which would continue the

handout to the industry, as a safe vote for children. But Senate Democrats need to use

their new-found clout to stop corporate welfare for the drug industry.&quot; </font>
