- January 16 - Today's most pressing

health care crises will top the 2001 legislative agenda of the

American Medical Student Association (AMSA), according to the

organization's president Sindhu Srinivas, MD. Medical students

will challenge legislators on Capitol Hill to address universal

health care, health disparities and medical errors committed by

overtired physicians. Founded in 1950, AMSA

<a href="http://www.amsa.org">(http://www.amsa.org)</a> is the nation's

largest, independent

medical student organization with more than 30,000 members.

<p>Universal health care will be the focus of numerous

legislative vehicles in early 2001, and AMSA will work to

educate members of Congress and its own physicians-in-training

on the dire need for radical and immediate reform of the health

care delivery system in this country.

<p>"It is unconscionable that 45 million Americans struggle

without health insurance, while it is criminal that 25 cents of

every dollar spent of health in this country is wasted in

administrative overhead," Srinivas said. "Years have been wasted

fighting for minor reforms in managed care plans while studies

have proven that for-profit managed care has failed.

Organizations across the political spectrum propose conflicting

solutions to the problems-solutions designed to support their

constituencies, yet are doomed to failure."

<p>AMSA believes immediate changes must be made and the

organization will support congressional legislation sponsored by

Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), and Rep. John Tierney (D-Mass.)

and Jim McDermott (D-Wash.). AMSA maintains that McDermott's

H.R. 1200, the American Health Security Act, contains the most

comprehensive universal health plan under consideration. AMSA

has prepared a comparison chart outlining several major

proposals for universal health care and has made that chart

available at <a href="http://www.amsa.org/lad/uhcinitiative.html">http://www.amsa.org/lad/uhcinitiative.html.</a>

<p>The pervasive disparity between the health care of the

underprivileged and minorities and wealthier Americans has

become a top issue for AMSA. AMSA's legislative and programming

efforts will continue to support congressional action to close

the gap, including economic development in depressed inner

cities and increasing the number of scholarships awarded by the

National Health Service Corps.

<p>"We don't think there's a silver bullet to defeat health

disparities in this country," said Srinivas. "But removing a

toxic waste dump from an inner-city community and improving the

ratio of doctors to patients in rural areas are concrete steps

that must be taken." AMSA has prepared additional resources on

this issue, online at <a href="http://www.amsa.org/div/">http://www.amsa.org/div/</a>.

AMSA's national

convention scheduled for late March in Anaheim, Calif., will

feature keynote speakers, plenary discussions and workshops

designed to address how medical students can work toward the

goal of zero health disparities. Learn more about AMSA's 51st

Annual Convention online at

<p>A reformation of the resident-physician work hour system is

expected to see movement in the new Congress. Residents-new

doctors completing their training in hospitals-are routinely

forced to work 36-hour shifts and 100-hour workweeks. Studies

have shown that persons awake for more than 24 hours perform as

if legally drunk, and AMSA believes that fatigue caused by such

long hours logically leads to errors committed on patients. A

1999 Institute of Medicine report showed that as many as 100,000

Americans die each year in hospitals due to preventable errors.

AMSA hopes to work with congressional supporters to introduce

legislation to require hospitals to curtail resident work-hours

or face stiff penalties. AMSA's resources on this issue can be

found at <a href="http://www.amsa.org/lad/reswork.html">http://www.amsa.org/lad/reswork.html.</a>

<p>Hundreds of medical students participated in a variety of

'lobby days' last year on these issues of critical importance,

including a major rally last March on the steps of the U.S.

Capitol, in conjunction with a celebration of the organization's

50th anniversary. AMSA's full-time legislative affairs director,

a medical student taking a year away from training, directs the

efforts of the independent, wholly student-run organization's

legislative advocacy efforts in Washington. In addition to the

organization's work in Washington, the organization regularly

undertakes national letter-writing campaigns and local

activities such as candlelight vigils to raise public awareness

on these issues and others.
