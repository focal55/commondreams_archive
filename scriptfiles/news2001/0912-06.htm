- September 12 - We profoundly condemn yesterday's 

cruel attacks in the United States and express our condolences to the 

victims and their loved ones.  This was an assault not merely on one 

nation or one people, but on principles of respect for civilian life 

cherished by all people.  We urge all governments to unite to 

investigate this crime, to prevent its recurrence, and to bring to 

justice those who are responsible.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last night, President Bush said that the United States &quot;will make no 

distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those 

who harbored them.&quot;  Yet distinctions must be made: between the guilty 

and the innocent; between the perpetrators and the civilians who may 

surround them; between those who commit atrocities and those who may 

simply share their religious beliefs, ethnicity or national origin. 

People committed to justice and law and human rights must never descend 

to the level of the perpetrators of such acts.  That is the most 

important distinction of all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are people and governments in the world who believe that in the 

struggle against terrorism, ends always justify means.  But that is also 

the logic of terrorism.  Whatever the response to this outrage, it must 

not validate that logic.  Rather, it must uphold the principles that 

came under attack yesterday, respecting innocent life and international 

law.  That is the way to deny the perpetrators of this crime their 

ultimate victory.</font></p>
