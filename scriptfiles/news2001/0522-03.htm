- May 22 - The U.S. Environmental 

Protection Agency today finalized its plan to delay until February 

a rule that would strengthen standards for arsenic, a known 

carcinogen, in drinking water. The nine-month delay comes after the 

arsenic rule was already postponed 60 days from its original March 

2001 effective date. Congressional mandate legally required EPA to 

establish a final rule by June 22, 2001, a deadline that the agency 

will miss by eight months. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Not only is EPA thumbing its nose at the legal deadline set by 

Congress,&quot; said Maria Weidner of Earthjustice, &quot;they're also doing 

the American public a grave disservice by opting to delay and 

reconsider this important public health standard. The jury is in on 

arsenic's health effects-we know it's a poison and we know it 

causes cancer.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In today's rule, the agency justifies missing its June deadline 

and ignoring the law by asserting its authority -- independent of 

statutory deadlines -- to establish appropriate effective dates. 

The delay also will postpone until February 2002 stricter federal 

reporting requirements to inform communities of the contamination 

levels of arsenic in their drinking water. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Bush administration is flouting the law by delaying the 

arsenic rule beyond the deadline set by Congress,&quot; said Joan 

Mulhern of Earthjustice. &quot;It seems their lawyers think they can get 

off on a technicality by trying to debate the meaning of the words 

in the law -- 'promulgate a final rule.' This is almost like trying 

to debate what the meaning of the word 'is' is. The 

administration's callous dismissal of the deadline shows they 

believe themselves to be above the law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We know the mining industry doesn't want to see tougher 

arsenic standards,&quot; added Weidner. &quot;The Bush administration is 

clearly more interested in keeping their corporate donors happy 

than they are in complying with Congress's directives.&quot; </font></p>
