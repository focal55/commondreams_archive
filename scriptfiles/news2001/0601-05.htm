- June 1 -  Concerned consumers were on hand at Wal-Mart&#146;s annual meeting today to convince shareholders that the company should not sell irradiated food. They gathered outside the Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus and distributed leaflets to shareholders entering the arena.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leaflets drew shareholders&#146; attention to Wal-Mart&#146;s plan to test market irradiated meat at some of its stores. They described the health questions surrounding irradiated food, and said that a decision to sell irradiated products would violate the principles upon which the company was founded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, representatives of Public Citizen delivered petitions and letters to Wal-Mart corporate headquarters in Bentonville. The letters and petitions were signed by more than 4000 Wal-Mart customers asking the company not to sell irradiated food. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public Citizen&#146;s Patty Lovera said that &quot;Irradiating food simply serves to mask problems in slaughterhouses and processing plants that contaminate meat with feces and other filth. The meat industry needs to address the cause of these contamination problems, not just try to sterilize their products after the fact.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Wal-Mart customers deserve better than nutritionally vacant, chemically altered food&quot; declared Marquette Mycue of Socially Principled Individuals Responding in Truth (SPIRIT), a local group concerned about food irradiation. &quot;We&#146;re here to let Wal-Mart shareholders know that if their company is going to live up to their consumers&#146; expectations, they must pledge not to sell irradiated food&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food irradiation exposes food to high doses of energy in order to kill bacteria and extend shelf life. While proponents of the process state that irradiation will make food safer, no one really knows the health impacts of eating irradiated food. Because irradiation disrupts the chemical composition of everything in its path, new chemicals are created and vitamins, essential fatty acids and other nutrients in food are destroyed. Many of the new chemicals are untested, but some are known carcinogens, and one has recently been found to cause genetic damage in rats and human cells. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are no studies on the long-term effects of irradiated food on humans, and the Food and Drug Administration has ignored many of its own rules in legalizing irradiation. However, there is research dating to the 1950&#146;s linking irradiated food to chromosomal damage, organ malfunction, and vitamin deficiencies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the health questions surrounding irradiated food, there are other concerns. Irradiation masks and encourages filthy conditions in slaughterhouses and food processing plants. It can kill most of the bacteria in food, but it does nothing to remove the feces, urine, vomit, and pus that often contaminate meat. Because it increases the shelf life of food and utilizes large centralized facilities, irradiation encourages consolidation of the food industry. The trend of consolidation has already forced multitudes of family farmers and ranchers out of business and reduced the diversity of products in the marketplace. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most consumers share the views expressed by those passing out leaflets at the shareholders meeting. A 1999 poll commissioned by the American Association of Retired Persons and the Center for Science in the Public Interest found that 88.6 percent of Americans want irradiated food labeled. A 1997 CBS News poll found that 77 percent of Americans would not buy irradiated food.</font></p>
