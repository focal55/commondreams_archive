- March 20 - As one of President Bush's Pentagon reviews is soon to be completed,

defense experts are speculating which weapons programs will be cut.  TheMarine Corps V-22 Osprey is one of the threatened systems, and we think it

should end up on the chopping block as it did in 1989.  The following are

some excerpts from the upcoming Council for a Livable World Education

Fund's FY 2002 Military Spending Briefing Book regarding the Osprey. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is the V-22 is airworthy and safe?  <i>&quot;The Osprey is a proven technology&#133;

purchased only after careful consideration for cost and operational

effectiveness.&quot; </i>- Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Jones</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Actually, this is not true.  The V-22 has crashed four times, killing 30,

including two crashes last year causing 23 fatalities.  An August 2000

report by the Pentagon's Inspector General described 22 &quot;major

deficiencies&quot; in the Osprey program.  Recent evidence of falsified

maintenance records, which is now fingering Marine generals, proves that

the Marines closest to the V-22 know it will not fly as advertised.  PhilipCoyle, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Testing and Evaluation,

claimed in a Nov. 2000 report that the Osprey's poor reliability record&quot;suggests the V-22 would be available to conduct fewer missions, would

abort during a mission more often and would pose a significantly increased

maintenance burden.&quot;  A January 2001 GAO briefing revealed the Osprey's

susceptibility to uncontrollable descents and accused the Navy of deleting&quot;significant testing that would have provided additional knowledge on V-22

flying qualities&#133;to meet program cost and schedule pressures.&quot;  Most

recently, the independent panel investigating the V-22's credibility

accused Bell-Textron of purposefully glossing over the dangers of this

uncontrollable descent, or vortex-ring state. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is the V-22 needed by the Marines?  The Corps has not engaged in an

amphibious assault since the Korean War, yet they continue to insist the

Osprey is necessary to bring troops ashore quickly.  However, any potential

quick troop deployment would be delayed until slower helicopters could

transport the necessary heavy equipment the Osprey cannot carry.  Moreover,

Coyle noted that the V-22 can only complete its missions 57% of the time.

Internal Marine documents show that percentage is usually significantly

lower.  If the Osprey cannot fly when needed, any potential advantage theV-22 may have over older transport helicopters is lost.</font></p>
