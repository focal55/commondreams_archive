- July 30 - Green Party leaders today

celebrated the formation of the Green Party of the

United States and announced their application to the

Federal Election Commission for national committee

status, heralding a new era for the country&#146;s third

strongest political party. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party has grown an estimated 35% since the

historic Nader/LaDuke 2000 presidential campaign.

Already this year, more than half of our Greens

candidates for office have been elected. There is no

stopping the Green movement,&quot; said Jo Chamberlain,

co-chair of the newly elected Green Party Steering

Committee. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The new Green Party of the United States is the

political framework from which we will fuel the

momentum against corporate power that is building on a

global scale,&quot; she said. State Green parties voted

unanimously to form the new national party at their

recent convention in Santa Barbara, Calif. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The announcement was made in Santa Monica, where,

under the leadership of Green Mayor Mike Feinstein and

Green Councilmember Kevin McKeown, the city council

recently passed a groundbreaking living wage

ordinance. The first living wage ordinance in the

country to apply to the private sector, the law raises

wages to $10.50 an hour and provides benefits to some

2,000 low-wage workers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party is working for the things that will

make a positive difference in the lives of average

people,&quot; Mayor Feinstein said. &quot;We are working for

universal health care coverage, a living wage, a safe

and healthy environment, an end to the inhumane and

racist death penalty and war on drugs, and reforms to

put power back into the hands of the people &#150; the

issues Americans care most about.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feinstein announced a three-part strategy to build the

party in the coming years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Greens will win more campaigns by recruiting and

supporting viable candidates who will challenge

Democrats and Republicans at every level of

government. We will aggressively register new party

members to vote for our candidates. And we will work

to change our undemocratic, winner-take-all electoral

system to a fair and inclusive system of proportional

representation,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens are also organizing on colleges and

universities across the country with the help of the

newly formed Campus Greens, which holds its founding

convention August 9-12 at the University of

Illinois&#150;Chicago. More than 200 Campus Greens chapters

will be active by the fall. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party has been building in the United States

since 1984 and now has 91 elected officials in 21

states.</font></p>
