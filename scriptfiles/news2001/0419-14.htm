- April 19 - Shareholders and company executives attending today&#146;s Boise

Cascade Annual General Meeting received first-hand testimonies from an

international delegation of forest and human rights activists about the path

of environmental destruction and social unrest left by the corporation&#146;s

operations abroad.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following a press conference and rally on the State House steps, forest and

human rights advocates from Chile, Mexico and the U.S. appealed directly to

Boise Cascade shareholders to pressure the logging company to stop exporting

hit-and-run logging practices and instead end its business in old growth

wood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International speakers included Patricia Vera, International Coordinator of

&quot;Defensores del Bosque

Chileno&quot; (Defenders of the Chilean Forest), from Santiago, Chile, and

Enrique Rodriquez Krebs, representing Rodolfo Montiel and the Organization

of Farmer Ecologists of the Sierra de Petatlan and Coyuca de Catatlan,

Guerrero, Mexico. Rodolfo Montiel is a Mexican farmer imprisoned on trumped

up charges after he protested logging operations-including clear cuts to

fuel Boise Cascade&#146;s mill--near his home.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Forest advocates from around the Americas are here to let Boise Cascade

shareholders know that they are invested in an industry dinosaur, a company

unwilling to adopt modern business ethics and adapt to the changes in the

marketplace,&#148; commented Jennifer Krill of the Rainforest Action Network

(RAN). &#147;Even as the company&#146;s customers reject the use of old growth wood

and front-line communities in logging areas abroad say &#147;enough!&#148; Boise

Cascade disgracefully moves forward with business as usual.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boise Cascade has also come under intense public scrutiny in recent months

for its role as plaintiff in a suit designed to prevent some of the

country's largest remaining wilderness areas from being protected. Called

the most popular federal policymaking decision in U.S. history, the roadless

policy generated 1.6 million letters of support from citizens across the

country, five times more than any other policy announcement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month RAN launched a campaign targeting 500 customers of Boise

Cascade, urging each company to discontinue business relations with the

company. Boise Cascade's practices run counter to the purchasing policies of

many of its top customers such as Home Depot, Kinko's, Lowe's and others.

More than four hundred companies-including an estimated twenty-five percent

of the U.S. lumber market-have pledged to help protect the world's last

remaining old growth forests by eliminating the purchase and use of wood and

paper from these regions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday Ecopledge.com announced Boise Cascade as one of their five target

companies this year. Ecopledge.com, is a high-profile advocacy service that

works with consumers, investors and students to &#147;harness their power to

leverage concrete changes in corporate environmental behavior&#148; through

pledging not to work for, purchase products from, or invest in companies

with particularly egregious environmental track records.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boise Cascade acts as a primary distributor of wood products from old growth

forests globally. The company sells wood that has been ripped from

endangered forests in the Amazon Basin, tropical rainforests in Southeast

Asia, temperate rainforests in British Columbia and Chile, among other

areas. According to the World Resources Institute, more than three-quarters

of the world's old growth forests have already been logged and degraded,

much within the past three decades. In the United States, less than five

percent of our original forests remain</font></p>
