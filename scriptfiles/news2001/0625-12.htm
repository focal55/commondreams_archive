- June 25 - &quot;We applaud the United States Supreme Court's 6-3 decision today in United 

States v. United Foods striking down the mushroom checkoff program. Today's 

decision will mean the end of the beef and pork checkoff programs and other 

undemocratic, unfair programs that force farmers and ranchers to subsidize 

speech with which they fundamentally disagree.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We joined in a friend-of-the-court brief in this case because we believe 

the beef and pork checkoff programs, like the mushroom program struck down 

today, violate the First Amendment free speech rights of cattle and hog 

producers. Those programs not only violate our right to free speech, as the 

Court said today, but they also force hog farmers and cattle ranchers to 

fund our own destruction. They are taxation without representation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The beef checkoff program taxes all beef producers on every head of cattle 

sold, in order to fund programs almost exclusively carried out by the 

National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA). The NCBA uses those funds, 

directly and indirectly, to promote and carry out programs and policies 

that favor agribusiness corporations and erode the bargaining power of 

family farmers and ranchers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is unfortunate that producers have had to defend our rights in court 

against these undemocratic programs. Hog farmers fought for and won a vote 

to end the pork checkoff, but that decision was nullified by Secretary of 

Agriculture Ann Veneman, forcing hog producers into court to defend their 

vote. Beef producers submitted 145,000 signatures on petitions demanding a 

vote on continuation of the beef checkoff program, but USDA has denied us 

our right to a vote, and that case is also in court.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's decision will help family farmers and ranchers put an end to 

checkoff assessments that tax them to pay for programs with which they 

disagree and which operate against their best interests.&quot;</font></p>
