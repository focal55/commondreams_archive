- April 18 -  The World Resources

Institute (WRI) today launched SafeClimate.net

(<a href="http://www.SafeClimate.net">http://www.SafeClimate.net</a>),

a Web site where visitors can take

decisive action to address global warming.

<p>SafeClimate.net site challenges individuals and organizations to

calculate the size of their own carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint and

pledge to reduce it by taking one or more actions outlined on the

site. According to climate scientists, CO2 emissions from human

activities are the largest source of greenhouse gases contributing

to global warming.

<p>"We don't have to wait for our government to lead.

SafeClimate.net provides the opportunity for concerned citizens and

organizations to do their part and demonstrate their concern on

this issue," said Jonathan Lash, WRI president. "Every step toward

carbon reduction is a meaningful one in reducing the threat of

global warming."

<p>Visitors to SafeClimate.net can use the site's calculator to

estimate their carbon dioxide emissions from energy and

transportation use. It also offers a set of voluntary actions they

can take to reduce their emissions like purchasing climate-friendly

products on-line, signing up for green energy, and making easy

lifestyle changes such as properly maintaining appliances for

maximum energy efficiency. Any proceeds from the site will be used

to fund climate protection projects.

<p>SafeClimate.net also provides the latest information on climate

science, policy, and technology through a bimonthly column. Daily

environmental news is available at the site, too. Visitors will

have the opportunity to send letters to policymakers appealing for

them to reduce the threat of global warming.

<p>The site contains a report on WRI's pledge to reduce its own

carbon dioxide footprint. In 1999, WRI became the first non-profit

organization to commit to zero net emissions by 2005. To meet the

zero net goal, WRI uses energy efficient appliances in its office.

It also purchased carbon offsets by investing in a project in

Portland, OR to upgrade a school boiler to use natural gas instead

of oil, thereby reducing CO2 emissions.

<p>"By walking the talk, we have learned a tremendous amount about

the benefits and challenges of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

It's a healthy dose of reality that we can bring to our efforts to

stimulate action by governments and business," said Elizabeth Cook,

director of WRI's Environment and Business Program. "The Internet

is a great way to share our experience and tools to make it easier

for other office-based organizations."

<p>WRI is developing partnerships with a variety of membership

groups and organizations to increase SafeClimate.net's impact.

Environmental Defense will offer the SafeClimate.net's bimonthly

climate column, for example, on its recently launched ForMyWorld

Web site. ClimateGuru, an information management site for the

public and private sectors, will also feature the column, as well

as a link to the SafeClimate.net CO2 calculator. National Wildlife

Federation's Campus Ecology Program will offer energy-efficient

products sold through SafeClimate.net to engage their network.

Conservation International will be promoting SafeClimate.net

through its web site, given the serious impact climate change is

likely to have in accelerating species extinction.

<p>SafeClimate.net was developed through the support of individual

donors and private foundations, including the Shell Foundation, The

New York Community Trust, and the John D. and Catherine T.

MacArthur Foundation.

<p>"SafeClimate.net provides the public with the means to really

make a difference," said Kurt Hoffman, deputy director of Shell

Foundation. "With e-education, e-activism, and e-commerce, it's

really one-stop shopping," he added.

<p><i>The World Resources Institute (<a href="http://www.wri.org">http://www.wri.org</a>)

is an

environmental think tank that goes beyond research to create

practical ways to protect the Earth and improve people's lives.</i>
