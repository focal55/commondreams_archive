- September 28 - A coalition of environmental and consumer groups today

sent a letter to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National

Research Council (NRC) requesting that they cease further changes sought by

General Motors Corp (GM) to its recent report on automotive Corporate

Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.  The groups urged the cancellation

of a meeting planned for October 5, 2001 to re-open the Academy's recent

report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The NRC can't seem to say &quot;no&quot; to General Motors,&quot; said Ann Mesnikoff,

Global Warming and Energy Representative for the Sierra Club. &quot;We're

calling on the National Research Council to stop allowing itself to be

manipulated by GM.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report on CAFE standards, released on July 31, 2001, found that

technology exists to safely improve the fuel economy of cars and light

trucks. Although the report was produced by a panel described by the New

York Times as consisting &quot;mainly of engineers and consultants who have

worked for the auto and oil industries, along with some economists and

retired oil executives,&quot; it was welcomed by environmental and consumer

groups because it concluded that we can move forward to increase fuel

economy with existing technologies that will curb global warming, save

consumers money at the gas pump, and reduce our dependence on oil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On August 22, 2001, the NRC held a closed-door meeting with four

representatives of General Motors and one from DaimlerChrysler. Following

that meeting, the NRC announced that it would hold an October 5 meeting to

discuss, and possibly alter the report, despite the fact that proper peer

review and evaluation of the report was completed before the report's

release.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A letter from Alliance to Save Energy, American Council for an Energy

Efficient Economy, the Center for Auto Safety, Natural Resources Defense

Council, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists, asks the NAS and

NRC to cease modifying the report and cancel the October 5 meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just as General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have taken issue with the final

report, we also have identified problems, missed technologies, and flaws in

the analysis.  No doubt this report, or any report the NAS issues, is open

to criticism, but it is unprecedented that a dissatisfied interested party

would prevail upon the NAS to secure changes to a final report even under

the guise of clarifying language,&quot; reads the letter in part.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">September 28, 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Dr. Alberts and Mr. Colglazer:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We strongly object to the meeting the National Research Council plans to

hold on October 5, 2001 to discuss, and alter, the report entitled

Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)

standards.   It is our understanding that this meeting is the result of an

August 22, 2001 closed-door meeting between National Research Council (NRC)

staff and four representatives of General Motors and one from

DaimlerChrysler -- parties that have a major economic interest in the

findings of the Academy.  This process is troubling.  It undermines the

objectivity of the Academy and the NRC and raises questions about the

finality of NRC Reports.  We request that the October 5th meeting be

cancelled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report the NRC released on July 31, 2001 was peer-reviewed and final,

subject to editorial correction.  The National Academies' Study Process

states:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*As a final check on the quality and objectivity of the study, the

Academies appoint additional independent experts with a range of views and

perspectives to review and comment anonymously on the draft report prepared

by the committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*The review process is structured to ensure that the report addresses the

committee's charge and does not go beyond it; the findings are supported by

the evidence and arguments presented; the organization and exposition of

the report are effective and logical; and that the report is impartial and

objective. After revisions are made by the committee to satisfy the

institution's rigorous review process, the report is transmitted to the

agency that sponsored the study and released to the public. Names of the

principal reviewers are made public when the report is released.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*The reputation of the National Academies for objectivity, integrity,

independence, and competence is one of its most valuable assets. For this

reason, the procedures designed to ensure excellence apply to each study

undertaken and to each step of the study process.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The peer-review process took place in July and the report was revised prior

to the July 31st release.  Now, after the ex parte August 22, 2001 meeting

the NRC is improperly reconvening the CAFE committee and opening up the

report to further discussion and changes.  This violation of process

undermines the reputation of the Academy and its objectivity, integrity and

independence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The industry, including General Motors, has had an active, if not dominant,

role in the preparation of the report: various companies provided testimony

and their employees, representatives, and contractors participated in the

Committee process and its technical analysis. One of the peer-reviewers,

William Agnew, is retired from General Motors Research Laboratories.   We

are now very disturbed that the National Academy of Sciences and the NRC is

providing General Motors with further, undue influence over modifications

to the content and characterization of the fuel economy ranges included in

the final report the Committee issued to Congress and the public.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several of us have had conversations with Alan Crane, a staff member of the

NRC. Mr. Crane has stated that while the October 5th meeting will not yield

changes in the ranges of fuel economy improvements or &quot;break-even&quot; analyses

in the report, it will lead to changes in how those ranges are described.

The NRC has publicly stated that the auto industry's private communications

have already persuaded the NRC that report was overly optimistic.  We

understand that these concerns are now being addressed in the report as it

undergoes editorial revision.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just as General Motors and DaimlerChrysler have taken issue with the final

report, we also have identified problems, missed technologies, and flaws in

the analysis.  No doubt this report, or any report the NAS issues, is open

to criticism, but it is unprecedented that a dissatisfied interested party

would prevail upon the NAS to secure changes to a final report even under

the guise of clarifying language. The Union of Concerned Scientists,

however, is prepared to present a technical criticism of the report should

the October 5 meeting take place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is appropriate for all sides to release their criticism of the report

publicly and in writing.  The October 5 meeting is inappropriate and raises

legal questions.  The charge to the NAS from Congress was to convene a

committee and finalize a report by July 1, 2001.  The CAFE Committee

completed its work and issued its report on July 31. The work of the CAFE

Committee is over and there is no basis for the NRC to convene a 10th

meeting of this Committee more than two months later.  Moreover, it is

highly improper for the NRC to effectively facilitate a critique,

instigated by the auto industry.  Any changes, beyond editorial changes,

made to the report or issued in a supplemental report or statement will be

unacceptable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In our view, any separate memo or other form of statement by the NRC or the

CAFE Committee on the topic of CAFE would constitute an improper extension

of the study and will be considered part of the Report.  In this regard, we

believe that the NRC has already violated the integrity of its process

through statements to the press and others since August 22.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report issued on July 31, 2001 must not be opened.  We strongly object

to the October 5th meeting and request that the NRC cancel the meeting and

that the report not be modified, even under the pretext of providing

clarifications or reinterpretation.</font></p>
