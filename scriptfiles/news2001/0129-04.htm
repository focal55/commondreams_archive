- January 29 - The drumbeat began Jan. 18, when President-designate George W.

Bush put much of the blame for California's energy problems on

clean air standards: "If there's any environmental regulations

that's preventing California from having a 100 percent max output

at their plants -- as I understand there may be -- then we need to

relax those regulations," he told CNN.

<p>Within days, that myth began spreading like the flu -- almost as

if it were a coordinated campaign:

<p>-- Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said easing clean-air standards

"is an option" to address Californa's troubles. The President's

chief economic adviser, Larry Lindsey, repeated that message.

<p>-- Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), new chairman of the House Energy

and Commerce Committee, asserted that clean air standards were

constricting operation of existing power plants in California. A

Tauzin spokesman piled on: "The clean air laws have created part of

the problem in California," he said.

<p>-- Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), new chairman of the House

Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, will examine the California

situation. "Some of the (national clean air health) standards may

be too tight," he told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram.

<p>-- The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has

scheduled a hearing on California Jan. 31 with "clean air rules in

the crosshairs," according to one published report.

<p>-- Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) asserted in a letter to his

congressional colleagues that "environmental extremism" was "almost

exclusively" the cause of California's problem.

<p>-- The National Petrochemical and Refiners Association jumped on

the bandwagon when it announced it would sue to overturn EPA's new

diesel clean-up standards: "We can see today in the California

electricity market what happens when policymakers take continued

supplies of energy for granted."

<p>-- And the auto industry -- in a failed attempt to persuade

California to repeal its zero-emission vehicle program -- made the

shameless argument that vehicle requirements would have a

measurable impact on California's energy supply.

<p>In other words, California has become a poster child for

demagogues who would seek to roll back clean air protections.

<p>The Facts Give a Lie to the Myth

<p>It's time to give this mythology a breather and look at the

facts:

<p>-- About myth number one (the President's assertion that clean

air restrictions are preventing California plants from operating):

I would commend to everyone's attention an excellent article in the

Jan. 25 Los Angeles Times, which notes that "power plants

throughout California are running around the clock, cranking out as

many megawatts as possible to ward off blackouts." The sole

exception is a small utility run by the city of Glendale -- and it

is supposed to be running at full production within a matter of

days. Sorry, Mr. President. Time to hire some better-informed

advisers.

<p>-- About myth number two (the insinuation that the Clean Air Act

had blocked construction of new electric power plants in

California): This is flat out false. The law does require, in

areas such as Los Angeles that are in violation of national clean

air health standards, that increased pollution from major new

sources be offset by reductions from existing pollution sources.

But, according to the California Energy Commission, no electric

power plant in California has been rejected for lack of offsets.

In other words, the Clean Air Act has not blocked construction of

a single plant in California.

<p>Some Key Reasons for the Power Shortage

<p>If not clean air, what has caused the California problem? The

real reason, of course, is the disparity between electricity supply

and demand. There are a number of factors for this gap, but here

are some keys (let's leave aside the unusually dry weather that

restricted hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest, and the

charges that energy suppliers are manipulating supplies,

OPEC-style, to drive up prices and gouge consumers):

<p>-- In the early 1990s, California had more than enough

electricity to meet demand. Indeed, during the state's severe

recession, there was an oversupply.

<p>-- In the mid-1990s, when California began considering

complicated and controversial electricity deregulation, potential

electricity suppliers decided to wait and see how it would play out

before seeking to build new plants. Statistics from the California

Energy Commission document this phenomenon (check

<a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov">http://www.energy.ca.gov</a>): Virtually

no one even applied for a

permit to build a new plant in the mid-1990s.

<p>-- California's local power companies exploited this

uncertainty. In 1995, the state's major electric utilities,

including Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric,

helped kill a state plan that would have authorized creation of new

power plants sufficient to power 1.4 million homes, according to an

investigative report published in the Jan. 21 Los Angeles Daily

News. "The utilities argued that they could buy plenty of cheaper

power elsewhere -- an assertion that appears to be the epitome of

shortsightedness," the Daily News reported. "Edison does not

foresee a need to add any new capacity resources until 2005 at the

earliest," Southern California Edison said in a 1995 filing to the

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The power companies were

afraid that they might have to buy -- heaven forbid --

pollution-free wind power from independent producers.

<p>-- Once the deregulation issue was hashed out, energy companies

once again began to seek -- and get -- permits. According to the

Energy Commission, "Restructuring occurred in March 1998. Since

April 1999, the Energy Commission has approved nine major power

plant projects with a combined electric generation capacity of

6,278 megawatts." Fourteen additional projects are currently under

commission review. It is worth re-starting: clean air controls did

not block any of these projects.

<p>-- It is fair to note that some proposed plants -- even those

planned with advanced, super-clean technology -- face tough

scrutiny from nearly local communities. But that

"not-in-my-backyard" sentiment is not unique to California nor is

it a product of the Clean Air Act.

<p>-- As for electricity demand? Of course, it has grown by leaps

and bounds since California's economy recovered from the recession.

The Internet revolution has obviously accelerated demand far beyond

anything envisioned in the early 1990s. But supply is starting to

catch up.

<p>Lessons Learned?

<p>What are the lessons learned from this episode? Beware when a

politician -- even a soon-to-be President -- tries making clean air

a scapegoat for problems related to energy or the economy. Ditto

for a similar claim from a big polluter. And check the facts

before succumbing to mythology.
