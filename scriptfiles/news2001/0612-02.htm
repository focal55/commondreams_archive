- June 12 - As George W. Bush touched down on European soil for the first time as President, Greenpeace activists occupied a tanker full of oil bound for the U.S. to protest Bush&#146;s rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and support the European Union&#146;s action on the agreement with or without the U.S.</font>

</table></font>At 5:30 am EST today, fifteen Greenpeace activists* stopped the Greek registered oil tanker &quot;Cosmic&quot; from leaving the Statoil-owned Mongstad terminal and hung a banner, which read STOP OIL TO BUSH &#150; RATIFY KYOTO. The tanker was to carry 150,000 tons of crude oil from Norway to the U.S. east coast, leading to more unregulated CO2 emissions. As of 9:15 am EST, activists were still occupying the tanker near the Norwegian city of Bergen.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is too easy just to talk. Bush needs to be shown that the rest of the world is serious about global warming. We are stopping oil exports to show Bush the costs of not joining the international community to address global warming,&quot; said Truls Gulowsen, Greenpeace Nordic campaigner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These exports undermine Norwegian policy on the Kyoto Protocol by allowing Bush to take no legitimate action on climate change. Norway must show where it really stands on global warming and stick with the rest of Europe to ratify Kyoto,&quot; said Gulowsen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Though it is a first small step towards safeguarding Earth&acute;s climate, the Kyoto Protocol which has been formulated over ten years, is the ONLY legal instrument available to start tackling the problem on a global scale,&quot; said Kert Davies, who heads the Greenpeace global warming campaign in the U.S. &quot;Oil exports to the U.S. will only lead to continued unregulated CO2 emissions by a country that is trying to destroy the Kyoto Protocol,&quot; he continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norway is currently the eighth largest oil exporter to the U.S., and fuels the unregulated U.S. emissions with two percent of the total oil consumption. Norwegian exports in February amounted to more than 355 thousand barrels a day, which represents two tankers the size of the &quot;Cosmic&quot; per week. The Norwegian state-owned Statoil, soon to be privatized, supplies ten percent of the oil consumed on the U.S. east coast.</font></p>
