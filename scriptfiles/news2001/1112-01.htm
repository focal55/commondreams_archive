- November 12 - Since  08:30 this morning, Greenpeace staged a protest in Montreal where delegates from environment ministries and scientific experts from over 110 countries are meeting to discuss the future of the world’s remaining ancient forests. Seven inflatable animals representing the threatened wildlife of the world’s remaining forests greeted delegates as they entered the meeting.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the meeting opened, Greenpeace exposed governments for ignoring key recommendations by scientists to protect ancient forests globally.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meeting, which is the last preparatory meeting before next year’s Ancient Forest Summit,  is the most critical forest meeting in 10 years, offering world governments a last chance to save the ancient forests. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“The world’s remaining ancient forests are facing a crisis. If world governments do not act now, these crucial ecosystems will disappear, as well as the plants, animals and human communities that depend on them,”  said Greenpeace political advisor Gudrun Henne. “Despite the urgency of the ancient forests crisis, vital recommendations made by experts have been ignored. It is time to act, and we are calling on world governments represented here to agree on concrete measures to save these magnificent forests.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The action in Montreal comes in the wake of a series of protests by Greenpeace worldwide over the failure of world governments to halt ancient forest destruction since the Rio Earth Summit almost 10 years ago. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“In 1992, world governments adopted the Convention on Biological Diversity, a legally binding agreement aimed at conserving life on Earth. But since then, these governments have done little to live up to this commitment. Harbouring around two-thirds of the world’s land-based species, conserving forests is key to conserving biological diversity,” said Henne.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to FAO figures released last month,  an average of more than 15 million hectares of pristine forest in the tropics alone has been cleared each year during the 1990s. Meanwhile Jeffrey McNeely, Chief Scientist of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) has recently stated that “if forest clearing continues at 1990s rates, the forests will lose many of their remaining species by the middle of the 21st century.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Independent scientific evidence shows conclusively how ancient forests, from the boreal forests of Russia and Europe to the tropical forests of Brazil, are being eroded at a staggering pace. Unless urgent action is taken by world governments these magnificent forests will disappear, along with the unique human cultures and animals, such as the gorilla, orang-utan and brown bear,” said Henne.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/saveordelete/reports/saveordelete.pdf" target="_new">report</a> released by Greenpeace to highlight the SBSTTA meeting and the forthcoming Ancient Forest Summit, Greenpeace emphasised the role of world governments in contributing to the ancient forest crisis, pointing out both their failure to live up to earlier promises on conservation, and their culpability in failing to control the international forest products industry. Greenpeace calls on world governments to:

</font>

<p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stop their role in ancient forest destruction, by stopping any further industrial activities in intact ancient forests until ecologically responsible plants for forest conservation and sustainable use have been agreed and implemented.

</font>

<p>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clean up the timber trade, by ensuring that timber is produced and traded in a legal and ecologically responsible way.

</font>

<p>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Come up with the money, by providing at least US$15 billion each year to pay for forest conservation and sustainable development.</font>

</ul>
