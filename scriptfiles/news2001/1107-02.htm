- November 7 - The nation's governors became a little greener on Tuesday,

as Jim McGreevey (D-NJ) and Mark Warner (D-VA) were swept into office.

Both McGreevey and Warner were endorsed by the Sierra Club, and the

environment played a role in both elections, where the candidates pledged

to protect clean water and rein in suburban sprawl.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The environment was the big winner on Tuesday.  The citizens of New Jersey

and Virginia can trust that their air and water, shorelines and parks are

in safer hands as a result of the choices they made in the ballot booth,&quot;

said Margaret Conway, Sierra Club Political Director.  &quot;Voters care about

improving quality of life and protecting the environment, and they

responded by electing pro-environment governors in New Jersey and

Virginia.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In both states, all of the candidates jockeyed to claim the environmental

mantle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Virgina, Mark Warner stood out for his plans to protect water quality,

curb out-of-state waste, safeguard open space, and clean up the Chesapeake

Bay.  The Virginia Sierra Club endorsed Warner, reaching out to its 13,000

members and the rest of Virginia through media work, volunteers, and

distributing thousands of educational pieces on the race.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New Jersey race featured an even greater emphasis on the environment,

with open space protection serving as a major issue along with protecting

clean air and water.  A story in last week's Philadelphia Inquirer,

headlined &quot;Environment Stands Out As An Election Day issue&quot; noted that the

environment is &quot;an apple-pie issue in New Jersey,&quot; according to David

Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University in

Lawrenceville.   &quot;Jerseyans are not just being politically correct, but

they recognize the importance of the environment for their personal quality

of life,  the state's economy, and the value of their homes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New Jersey Sierra Club felt McGreevey stood out on those issues and

endorsed him in August, calling Bret Schundler a &quot;threat to the

environment.&quot;  McGreevey touted his Sierra Club endorsement in an October

10 debate, citing the endorsement as proof that he was the candidate who

would protect New Jersey's open space. The New Jersey Sierra Club also

supported McGreevey by mobilizing its 20,000 state members, generating

press, and activating dozens of volunteers to turn out the vote for

McGreevey.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club is energized by our victories in 2001 and we will use them

as a springboard for our activities in 2002,&quot; Conway said.  &quot;Today's wins

show that voters elect candidates who are committed to protecting the

environment and who back up that position with credible policies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Sierra Club is the nation's oldest and largest grassroots environmental

organization with over 700,000 members throughout the United States.
