- September 4 - U.S.



delegates to the World Conference Against Racism connect and

condemn the United States administration's walk out of both the

Kyoto Protocol and the WCAR as similar acts of environmental

racism and climate injustice, said representatives from a

diverse group of U.S. organizations attending the WCAR.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People of color, Indigenous peoples and workers bear a

disproportionate health, social, and economic burden of a

society addicted to a fossil fuel economy. As such, they are the

first victims of government inaction, corporate abuse, and

negligent public policy. "Foot dragging and inaction is not only

immoral, but is sending a death warrant in people of color

communities, which is tantamount to environmental racism," said

Dr. Robert Bullard, National Black Environmental Justice Network

and Professor of Sociology at Clark Atlanta University.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In April 2001, 25 civil rights, academic, religious,

grassroots, and policy organizations gathered to share

testimonies of struggle, and strategies for reducing the human

impact on climate change and for achieving environmental and

economic justice. Today at the WCAR, these diverse groups

unveiled a statement of solidarity about the problem of global

climate change. This statement recognizes the disproportionate

impacts on low-income, people of color, and Indigenous peoples,

and workers. In a call to action, the group demands that

governments and corporations include the concerns of these

affected communities and enact strong and fair policies to

address climate change.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(The full text of the statement is available at

<a href="http://www.rprogress.org/media/durban/" target="_new">www.rprogress.org/media/durban/</a>)

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the inequities of climate change:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Climate change-related insect and rodent-borne diseases,

respiratory problems related to air pollution, and deaths and

illness related to thermal extremes, will disproportionately

impact the poor and communities of color because of the

distribution of impacts and access to healthcare.

-- People of color are concentrated on the coastlines,

vulnerable to erosion and flooding due to sea level rise.

-- While wealthy homeowners have the means to move,

low-income households often do not and, usually renters, lack

insurance to replace possessions lost in storms and floods.

-- Indigenous peoples are already losing traditional

medicinal plants to a warming climate, and subsistence

households are suffering from the loss of species unable to

adapt climate change.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If the U.S. Administration truly represented Americans most

affected by climate change, they would not have walked away from

the Kyoto Protocol and the WCAR," said Jenice View, Executive

Director of the Just Transition Alliance.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although President Bush cites concern that curbing carbon

dioxide emissions would "harm our economy and hurt our American

workers," over 2,500 economists, including eight Nobel

Laureates-declared that policies to slow climate change can be

enacted without harming either the United States economy or

living standards

(<a href="http://www.rprogress.org/publications/econstatement.html" target="_new">www.rprogress.org/publications/econstatement.html</a>).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Fair and low-cost approaches to climate change can and must

be implemented. Given the evidence, the Bush Administration

appears to be selling out the U.S.'s people of color,

low-income, and Indigenous communities to the fossil fuel

industry that supported his election," said Tom Goldtooth,

Executive Director, Indigenous Environmental Network.
