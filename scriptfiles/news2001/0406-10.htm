<p>What: Press Conference

<br>Just the Facts: Tax Burdens on Typical Families

<br>9:15 a.m., April 13

<br>National Press Club, Murrow Room

<br>&nbsp;

<p>On Friday, April 13 at 9:15 a.m., in the Murrow Room of the

National Press Club, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities will

hold a press conference to assess how much Americans pay in taxes.

<p>The press conference will also examine the methodology the Tax

Foundation uses in computing what it calls "Tax Freedom Day," the day

until which the Foundation says the average American must work to pay

taxes. Last year, The Tax Foundation said it was May 3, but the

Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found significant flaws and

distortions in the methodology used to compute this date. In

addition, the Center noted, the federal tax burden on middle-income

families has fallen in recent years.

<p>The Tax Foundation plans a release later on the morning of April

13. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities anticipates issuing

a

timely analysis of it.

<p>Iris J. Lav, the Center's deputy director, will discuss Center

findings supported by data from sources such as the Congressional

Budget Office, the Treasury, and the Joint Committee on Taxation on

how much Americans are actually paying in taxes and the deficiencies

of the Tax Foundation methodology.

<p>For more information on Friday's press conference, contact

Michelle Bazie  or Jim Jaffe

at

202-408-1080.

<p>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a nonpartisan

research organization and policy institute that conducts research and

analysis on a range of government policies and programs, with an

emphasis on those affecting low- and moderate-income people. It is

supported primarily by foundation grants.
