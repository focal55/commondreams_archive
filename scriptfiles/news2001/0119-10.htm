- January 19 - NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON

<p>"That an election for an American President can be stolen by the

highest court in the land under the deliberate pretext of an

inapplicable constitutional provision has got to be one of the most

frightening and dangerous events ever to have occurred in this

country."

<p>Renowned litigator and award-winning writer Vincent Bugliosi

dissects the US Supreme Court's election decision in an explosive

analytic report in the February 5, 2001 issue of The Nation

magazine.

<p>His conclusion that the five justices who made up the majority

in Florida election case "are criminals in every true sense of the

word, and in a fair and in a just world belong behind bars," while

shocking, is supported by past precedent and a statutory reading of

the applicable laws governing judicial conduct, as Bugliosi rightly

insists.

<p>Read this explosive report in its entirety at <a href="http://www.thenation.com">www.thenation.com</a>.

<p>Vincent Bugliosi successfully prosecuted 105 out of 106 felony

jury trials as a Los Angeles deputy district attorney, including

twenty-one murder convictions without a single loss. His

<br>

prosecution of Charles Manson was the basis for his true-crime

bestseller, Helter Skelter (Bantam). He is also the author of

Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away With Murder

(Island).
