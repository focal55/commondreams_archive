- February 6 -  When the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) announced

its 2001 Grammy Award nominations on January 3, many feminists were angry

but not terribly shocked. Rapper Eminem, infamous for his menacing lyrics,

is up for four Grammy Awards this year, including Album of the Year. Eminem

has become one of the hottest musicians today, with many young fans and

mainstream music outlets and critics embracing him. And now the Grammys

have invited Eminem to perform at the February 21 ceremonies to be telecast

live on CBS.

<p>National NOW President Patricia

Ireland will join activists from the Gay

&amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), California

NOW and other organizations outside the Los Angeles event to protest

the hate and violence that NARAS legitimizes by honoring Eminem.

<p>Women's rights advocates and lesbian and gay groups have been speaking

out against Eminem's violent songs for over a year now. NOW Executive Vice

President Kim Gandy appeared in an

MTV special on hate, where she addressed the dangerous implications of

Eminem's lyrics. MTV itself has attempted to retreat from the key role

it played in making Eminem a star, and even devoted 17 hours recently to

the stories of hate crime victims. But the music channel is still the main

place to watch Eminem videos and a dependable peddler of the exploitation

of women.

<p>Those in the music industry deflect charges that Eminem promotes violence

by talking about the artistry of the production and the complexity of his

musical arrangements. Most critics who put his album on their top ten lists

for 2000 admit that his lyrics are offensive and inflammatory, but bow

to its popular influence and driving beats. His supporters say Eminem's

just joking, or he's reflecting a culture that's already warped.&nbsp;

They say he's started a dialogue about hate. But feminists know that dialogue

started a long time ago and Eminem hasn't added anything new to the discussion–he's

just proved how far a musician can go and still reap the rewards of fame,

money and accolades.

<p>Eminem's music contains some of the most explicit descriptions of violence

ever to make their way into people's homes. In addition to consistently

calling women bitches, sluts and whores, Eminem sings about killing his

wife and raping his mother. He strikes out at everyone, including his fans,

but has a particular bloodlust for women, lesbians and gays.

<p>Is it possible for music fans to listen to a recording and hear only

the rhythm, not the words and their meanings? And what does that say about

the state of music? Or, do most of his fans hear the words, but are not

bothered by them? And what does that say about our culture?

<p>Here's a sample of Eminem's lyrics, all of which appear on his Grammy-nominated

album, words which fans and critics either don't hear or don't take offense

to:

<p>* Put your hands down, b*tch, I ain't gon' shoot you

<br>I'ma pull YOU to this bullet and put it through you

<br>(from Kill You)

<p>* Don't you get it b*tch, no one can hear you?

<br>Now shut the f*ck up and get what's comin to you

<br>You were supposed to love me

<br>NOW BLEED! B*TCH BLEED!

<br>(from Kim)

<p>*&nbsp; My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge

<br>That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or lez

<br>(from Criminal)

<p>* I make fight music for high school kids

<br>I put lives at risk when I drive like this

<br>I put wives at risk with a knife like this

<br>(from Who Knew)

<p>* B*tch, please - you must have a mental disease

<br>Assume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon

<br>(from B*tch Please II)

<p>Violence against women is a serious problem, one that women's rights

groups, shelters and survivors of male violence deal with every day. To

ignore Eminem's lyrics proves only how numb our society is becoming to

violence as entertainment. To treat his words as a joke communicates to

a large number of boys and young men that violence against a wife, girlfriend

or mother is something to laugh at.

<p>With Eminem's Grammy nominations viewed as a seal of approval, many

more people have stepped forward to voice their outrage. Young women, parents,

people of all political persuasions are writing to NOW, asking what they

can do. While Eminem continues to make lots of money for lots of people,

he will most likely be everywhere. But we can certainly shame those who

profit from and promote him and his music. If you're going to be in the

Los Angeles area on February 21, come to the protest outside the Staples

Center at 3:00 pm. If not, write to NARAS, 3402 Pico Boulevard, Santa Monica,

CA 90405 and tell them what you think about the members of the Recording

Academy giving a platform to hate and violence.
