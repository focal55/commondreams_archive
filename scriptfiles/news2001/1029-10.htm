- October 29  - Saturday, November 10, Ralph Nader will bring 

                                his &quot;People Have the Power Tour&quot; to 

                                Boston&#146;s Orpheum Theater to support global 

                                justice, security, human rights and American democracy.

<p>&quot;The purpose of these events this year is 

                                to bring people together in cities across America, 

                                which is especially critical now,&#148; said Nader, 

                                the 2000 Green Party Presidential Candidate. &#147;Progressive 

                                Bostonians must work together. Civil liberties 

                                for all Americans are at risk in Congress and 

                                the Executive Branch. While we mourn the victims 

                                of the recent terrible massacres, we will honor 

                                their memory by working together to make sure 

                                the values of democracy, enforcement of the laws, 

                                the respect for human rights, and the protection 

                                of all innocent people prevail here and spread 

                                around the world. Locally, the event will focus 

                                on campaigns for clean elections in Massachusetts 

                                and universal health care.&quot;</p>

<p>Nader 

                                will by joined by recording artist Patti Smith 

                                and numerous internationally acclaimed artists, 

                                celebrities, and community leaders working for 

                                progressive social change.</p>

<p>Boston 

                                is the fifth stop in a nationwide tour, which 

                                began this summer in Phoenix and then continued 

                                to Portland, OR on Aug. 4, 2001 which drew over 

                                7,500 people. Nader likened this current tour 

                                to the &quot;Super Rallies&quot; he headlined 

                                during his bid for the Presidency in 2000. Those 

                                rallies filled nine major arenas from Oakland&#146;s 

                                Kaiser Arena to New York's Madison Square Garden 

                                with crowds that greatly surpassed turnouts generated 

                                by the major candidates. This event is being sponsored 

                                by Nader's newest organization, Democracy Rising, 

                                which seeks to unify people &quot;in the cause 

                                of freeing American politics from the grip of 

                                corporate interests,&quot; he said.</p>
