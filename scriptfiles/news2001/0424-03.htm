- April 24 - Berkeley students will occupy a building and hold a sit-in on

the UC Berkeley campus at noon on Tuesday, April 24, 2001. As the assault of

Palestinians escalates in the Middle East, students are taking urgent direct

action to demand that the UC Regents sever the University&#146;s connection to

the Israeli military regime.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Students for Justice in Palestine at Berkeley (SJP) will sit-in on the UC

Berkeley campus and will be joined by various campus organizations, members

of the Bay Area Activist community and well-known Berkeley professors. SJP

calls for an end to the University's investments in companies with

significant holdings in Israel. Preliminary findings indicate this amount to

be $6.4 billion out of the total portfolio worth $59 billion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the University of California's Regents meeting in Davis on April 12,

2001, SJP presented demands for divestment. The group requested a deadline

of April 22nd for the Regents to respond. This deadline has passed with no

response from the Regents. The rally and sit-in will reiterate these demands

and send a clear message to the Regents that students and people of

conscience oppose such irresponsible investment in the Israeli war machine.

SJP will wage its campaign for divestment from Israel until the Israeli

government dismantles its Apartheid policies that racially discriminate

against the indigenous Palestinian population. First and foremost, the

Israeli government must recognize its responsibility for the creation of the

Palestinian refugee problem and allow them their legal Right of Return. SJP

member Yalda Afshar claims Israeli Apartheid &quot;is epitomized fundamentally by

Israel's Law of Return, which grants a Jew anywhere in the world full

immigration and citizenship rights, whereas Palestinians, exiled by force in

1948, have no such right.&quot; Afshar indicates that such racial distinction

violates numerous United Nations resolutions, its founding charter, and

various international conventions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SJP bases its campaign on the precedent set by the 1980s Anti-Apartheid

movement, in which the University of California committed to anti-racist

policies and withdrew its investments from the South African economy. The

recent Israeli invasion and destruction of homes in Khan Younis resembles

previous Israeli aggression in the 1982 Sharon-headed massacre at Sabra and

Shatila. The parallels between Israeli and South African Apartheid are very

strong.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SJP is a diverse coalition of students, faculty, and community members

formed in October 2000 at the University of California, Berkeley with an

interest in the human rights of the Palestinian people and their struggle

for liberation under Israeli occupation. SJP also seeks to raise public

awareness in the United States about the plight of the Palestinian refugees.

SJP conducts education, programming, information distribution, and other

coordinated efforts in order to counterbalance anti-Palestinian biases in

the American media.
