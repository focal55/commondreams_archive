- October 19 - Ajamu Baraka, a human rights activist who has 

worked to abolish the death penalty for 15 years, will receive the 

Abolitionist of the Year Award this weekend from the National Coalition 

to Abolish the Death Penalty.  Baraka directed AIUSA’s National 

Program to Abolish the Death Penalty over the past 12 months, at a time 

when intense international attention was focused on capital punishment 

in the United States. Baraka is now the Director of AIUSA’s Southern 

Regional Office in Atlanta.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are honoring Ajamu for his longtime service and remarkable 

dedication to the abolition of the death penalty," said National Coalition 

to Abolish the Death Penalty Executive Director Steven W. Hawkins. 

"As Southern Regional Director of Amnesty International, Ajamu has 

traveled extensively throughout the South, highlighting not just the 

death penalty cases that receive tremendous media attention, but each 

and every case, regardless of the level of publicity." Baraka said, “This 

award is important to me, but also to Amnesty International because it 

recognizes the outstanding work of Amnesty activists and supporters. 

This honor will inspire me to continue speaking forcefully to stop 

executions, one of the most egregious violations of human rights.” 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baraka, a native of Chicago, has served with AIUSA since 1987, first as a 

Ralph Bunche Human Rights Fellow, then as a Board Member, and now 

as Director of the Southern Regional Office in Atlanta. He has taught 

political science at universities including Clark Atlanta University and 

has been a guest lecturer at schools throughout the US. In 1998, UN 

Secretary General Kofi Annan and the international community honored 

Baraka at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, as one of 300 human rights 

defenders from around the world convened to commemorate the 50th 

anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baraka noted that tremendous progress has been made in the past two 

years toward educating the public about the cycle of violence 

perpetuated by the death penalty. He is optimistic about building on that 

progress.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“We have an abolition unity plan among organizations at the national 

level, growing doubt about the death penalty system, significant 

momentum with the moratorium in Illinois, and a lot more scrutiny of the 

system as a reward for our hard work,” Baraka said. “As the public 

continues to examine the death penalty in a moral context, I believe that 

support for abolition of the death penalty will grow.”

He emphasized that this award is for all of the people who have worked 

to abolish the death penalty in the United States. During his acceptance 

speech, Baraka will call on activists “to stay the course and victory will 

follow.”



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The award will be presented at a dinner Saturday at the Brownstone 

Hotel, 1707 Hillsborough Street, in Raleigh. Ajamu Baraka can be reached 

at 678/232-3790 for interviews.
