- May 25 - By a 67-29 percent margin, American voters oppose allowing off-road vehicles, including snowmobiles and jet skis, in America's national parks, according to a new poll released by Zogby International. In addition, an overwhelming majority of Americans support decisions by the National Park Service to phase-out snowmobiles from Yellowstone (66-29 percent) and jet skis from our coastal National Parks (60-37 percent). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The message is clear: the American people love their National Parks and want them protected from the damage caused by dirt bikes, jet skis, snowmobiles and other off-road vehicles,&quot; said William H. Meadows, President of The Wilderness Society. &quot;Nevertheless, the Bush administration assault on our National Parks continues unabated. This poll provides further evidence that President Bush and Secretary of Interior Norton are completely out-of-step with the American people when it comes to protecting our Parks.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll results come as Bush Administration officials hold closed-door negotiations with snowmobile, jet ski and other off-road vehicle industries. &quot;These secret talks could weaken, and possibly eliminate, critical protections for Yellowstone and Denali National Parks, Big Cypress National Preserve and more than 20 National Seashores and Lakeshores,&quot; Meadows said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Yellowstone, the Bush administration has indicated publicly it might overturn a rule issued by the Park Service that would phase-out snowmobile use in the Park. A proposal by the industry, now being considered by the Administration, would allow snowmobile use to continue at current levels, which are proven to harm buffalo, elk and other wildlife, drown out the eruptions of Old Faithful, and threaten public safety. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1998, the Service has held 22 public hearings and collected tens of thousands of public comments concerning its proposal to phase-out snowmobiles from Yellowstone. Throughout this process, a clear majority has supported the phase-out. The poll demonstrates that this support continues to grow with nearly two-thirds (66%) of respondents endorsing the Park Service's plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite strong public support for phasing out snowmobiles from Yellowstone, the Bush administration is accelerating closed-door negotiations with the industry,&quot; said Jon Catton, a spokesman for the Greater Yellowstone Coalition. &quot;Against this backdrop, the message from the American people is loud and clear: stop putting special interests ahead of protecting our National Parks.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By a 70-24 percent margin, American voters believe the National Park Service should continue the phase-out of snowmobiles in Yellowstone even after respondents were told of manufacturers' plans to release new machines that they claim will run cleaner and quieter than existing models. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's clear that the American people aren't buying the bill of goods the snowmobile industry is trying to sell on redesigned snowmobiles,&quot; said Kevin Collins of the National Parks Conservation Association. &quot;The problems that snowmobiles cause in Yellowstone go well beyond pollution and noise. The vast majority of Americans expect a complete solution, not half-way measures.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As families prepare to go to their favorite coastal National Park this Memorial Day weekend, they should be aware that Secretary of Interior Gale Norton has set aside the professional judgement of four local Park managers who have acted to eliminate jet ski use in order to protect natural resources and public safety. While the Secretary is overturning local decisions, three in five Americans support the Park Service decision to remove jet skis. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans have made it clear that they want their National Parks protected from loud, dangerous and dirty off-road vehicles such as jet skis, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles,&quot; said Sean Smith, Public Lands Director for Bluewater Network and a former Yellowstone Ranger. &quot;We urge President Bush to listen to the public and prevent the National Parks from deteriorating into nothing more than motorized amusement parks.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll, conducted for the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition, involved 1,003 likely voters nationwide between May 14 and 18, and has a margin of error of +/-3.2 percent.
