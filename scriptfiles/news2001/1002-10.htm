- October 2 - &#147;Resistance against oppressive US foreign policy and the 

School of Assassins is a necessity, not a crime!&#148;  This was the presiding tone 

among the more than 50 supporters who held vigil outside the Philadelphia 

courthouse this morning as the five SOA Watch activists went on trial for 

peacefully protesting the School of the Americas (SOA), located at Ft. Benning, 

GA.  Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, from Detroit, Michigan, offered eloquent 

testimony about the atrocities committed by graduates of the SOA.  Represented 

by former Pennsylvania Attorney General Shane Creamer (who took the case pro 

bono) and Public Defender Shawn Nolan, the activists were acquitted on all 

charges (disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, obstructing justice, obstructing 

a highway, and conspiracy to obstruct a highway).   </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the Republican National Convention (July 31, 2000), the five enacted a 

massacre carried out by SOA graduates, presided over by Uncle Sam.  Defendant 

Laurel Paget-Seekins stated, &#147;We put the SOA on trial today and the verdict 

shows that the real crime is the training of soldiers to repress their own 

people.  We will continue to nonviolently act to close this school of terror 

until it is shut down for good.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growing public outcry over the SOA and the exposure of the atrocities 

perpetrated by its graduates has moved Congress to action.  Legislation to 

close the school gradually gained bipartisan support, forcing the Pentagon to 

rename the SOA: the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, in 

January 2001. The Defense Department&#146;s intent was to disassociate the school 

from its murderous past, but the citizens&#146; movement and Congress were not 

fooled.   On May 10, 2001, a bipartisan bill was introduced in the House (HR 

1810) to close the SOA and investigate the relationship between the training 

and the countless human rights abuses perpetrated by graduates of the school. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During its 55-year history, the SOA has trained over 60,000 Latin American 

soldiers. It continues to train hundreds of soldiers yearly in combat skills 

such as commando tactics, mine warfare, military intelligence and psychological 

operations. SOA-trained troops return home to wage war against their own 

civilian population. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been 

tortured, raped, assassinated, &quot;disappeared,&quot; massacred and forced into refugee 

camps by those trained at the SOA.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the course of a decade, 75 SOA opponents have spent over 40 years 

collectively in federal prisons for nonviolent acts of civil resistance to SOA 

violence.  The &#147;SOA Philly 5&#148; commit themselves to working in solidarity with 

the 24 nonviolent resisters who are currently in federal prisons by continuing 

their witness to close this school of torture.   </font></p>

&#147;SOA Philly 5&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These human rights activists were arrested while acting out a massacre 

committed by graduates of the School of the Americas (SOA), commonly referred 

to as the &#147;School of Assassins.&#148;  For years the training at the SOA included 

manuals advocating the use of torture, kidnappings and executions.  The street 

theater was a creative attempt to bring the reality of the violence being waged 

against the poor and indigenous communities throughout Latin America to the 

streets of Philadelphia.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ally Styan, 18, is a recent high school graduate from Lancaster County, 

Pennsylvania and is currently working in the national office of SOA Watch.  

Ally has traveled to Nicaragua and Chiapas, Mexico to look at the effects of US 

foreign policy on the people of Latin America. These experiences led Ally to 

organize the Youth Coalition for Human Rights, a social justice group at her 

high school.  Since the RNC, Ally has continued in her work to bring justice 

and peace to the people of the Global South.  She has continued to put her body 

on the line in acts of civil disobedience to call attention to the violence of 

the SOA.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laurel Paget-Seekins, 21, grew up in Philo, California.  She graduated with 

honors from Oberlin College with a degree in mathematics and liberation 

struggles studies.  Laurel has been working to close the School of the Americas 

for four years, co-coordinating an active student SOAW chapter in Oberlin, 

Ohio.  She has traveled to Ft. Benning, Georgia, six times to protest the SOA.  

Last January, she was part of a 31-day fast and vigil at the gates to Ft. 

Benning.  Laurel is dedicated to nonviolence and to acting to create a more 

just world. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rebecca Johnson, 22, a recent graduate of Oberlin College and a social justice 

activist, has spent nearly four years organizing to close the school of 

assassins.  In January 2001 she organized a 31-day fast and vigil at the gates 

of Ft. Benning to draw attention to the reopening of the school under a 

different name.  As a woman of nonviolence, Becky hopes to denounce terrorism 

in this trial, especially terrorism funded by the US government in Latin 

America.  As she mourns in the wake of the September 11 tragedy, she asks, &#147;Are 

our hands clean?&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill Brown, 32, lives and works in Philadelphia.  Bill has been involved with 

the human rights movement in the Philadelphia area for several years spending 

the last three focusing on the School of the Americas.  Bill has been to Ft. 

Benning three times, crossing the line twice, most recently acting as a 

peacekeeper.  Bill completed a 14-day fast in April 2000 to draw attention to 

the crimes of the SOA.  Bill has lobbied for the closure of the school, helping 

to hold our public officials accountable for how our tax dollars are spent.  

Bill was part of an SOA Watch affinity group that ventured to Quebec this past 

spring to protest the FTAA.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Linda Panetta, 35, from Medford, NJ, is founder of SOA Watch/NE.  She has been working extensively on Latin American issues for the past 15 years.  She lived 

and worked in Guatemala and Nicaragua in the late 1980&#146;s, and in Oaxaca, Mexico 

in the mid-90&#146;s. She recently returned from Colombia, and continues to travel 

to Latin America working on human rights issues.  Linda is the producer and 

director of the award winning documentary &#147;School of the Americas: An Insider 

Speaks Out!&#148; (over 6,000 copies sold), and author of the book &#147;Solidarity in 

Action.&#148;  She does extensive lecturing, and has directed the effort with Bishop 

Gumbleton, which to date has resulted in a resolution signed by over 300 

bishops calling for the closure of the SOA.  Linda is a freelance photographer 

documenting, among other things, the realities in Latin America.</font></p>
