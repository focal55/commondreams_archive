- June 7 - The Bush 

Administration's recent budget release allows for zero funding 

for crucial family medicine training programs, and those cuts 

could create major headaches for the American people seeking 

primary care in rural and urban underserved areas, according to 

the American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation's 

largest, independent medical student organization. 



<p>The Bush budget eliminates federal funding for family 

medicine training programs under Title VII of the Public Health 

Service Act. These are the only programs at the federal level 

specifically designed to support family medicine training. 



<p>By reducing the number of medical students able to complete 

family medicine specialty training, Americans will be forced to 

look elsewhere for everyday, basic medical services provided at 

free clinics, community health centers and doctor's offices. 

This crisis could flood already-overwhelmed emergency rooms and 

cause a further collapse of the nation's already-frayed health 

safety net. 



<p>"Medical students need to be encouraged to seek out family 

medicine as a specialty," said Jaya Agrawal, AMSA national 

president. "Physicians in family medicine provide necessary 

preventive care, especially at a time when the nation's health 

care system is not focused on providing this valuable service to 

every American." 



<p>"People ask, why do students still pursue medicine, with all 

these problems?" asks Agrawal. "Medical students are saddled 

with six-figure debts before completing their four years of 

school. They can look forward to grueling work hours during 

their residency training, while being paid only a subsistence 

wage. Managed care bureaucracy makes doctoring an unpleasant, 

even unwanted, experience. Older physicians are retiring in 

greater numbers, while the number of physicians available to 

treat an ever diversifying population continues to dwindle." 



<p>Agrawal continues, "Into this morass enters the Bush 

Administration with an effort to wipe out an important program 

that directs physicians-in-training to careers in family 

medicine. It is interesting that President Bush has declared his 

commitment to community health centers, but has eliminated the 

program that places desperately needed doctors at these 

underserved clinics. These decisions do not bode well for the 

American people." 



<p>AMSA is committed to rectifying the shifts in public policy 

made in Washington, D.C. The organization will sponsor its third 

National Primary Care Week during October 2001, dedicated to 

promoting primary care as a medical specialty. This program, 

coordinated with other health professional students, will focus 

on the federal government's Healthy People 2010 initiative, 

which is designed to target specific health indicators.
