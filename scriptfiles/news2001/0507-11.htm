- May 7 -  The nonprofit Clean Air

Trust today assailed a new diesel fuel report by the Energy

Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S.

Department of Energy.

<p>"This report uses selective information in an obvious attempt

to help the oil industry undermine EPA's new diesel fuel

standards," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the

Clean Air Trust.

<p>"It raises real doubts about the Bush Administration's

intentions about the clean diesel standards," O'Donnell added.

"Will this lead to yet another flip-flop?" he asked, noting the

President used an earlier EIA study to justify a flip-flop on

carbon dioxide controls.

<p>The diesel fuel standards were announced late last year by

the Clinton Administration. They were embraced earlier this

year by EPA Administrator Christie Whitman and recently cited by

President Bush as evidence of his positive approach to

environmental protection.

<p>The standards would require low-sulfur diesel fuel for

highway vehicles by 2006. Low-sulfur fuel is needed to achieve

much cleaner diesel trucks and buses because the sulfur poisons

pollution control devices. EPA estimates the standards would

prevent 8,300 premature deaths a year and that it would produce

$70 billion in annual benefits by reducing exposure to smog,

soot and toxic air contaminants.

<p>The American Petroleum Institute and the National

Petrochemical and Refiners Association have filed suit against

the rules, claiming they could cost the oil industry too much

money and lead to fuel shortages.

<p>"These industry opponents of the standards appear to be the

primary resources for the new EIA study," said O'Donnell. The

study parrots their complaints about the standards, he said.

<p>The study appears to have ignored those companies, including

BP Amoco and Tosco, that have supported the diesel cleanup,

O'Donnell noted.

<p>O'Donnell added that EIA "gave short shrift to new

technologies that will dramatically reduce cleanup costs."

Several new, lower-cost methods were unveiled in March at a

refiners' meeting. For example, a new process by SulphCo, Inc.

of Nevada could remove the sulfur from diesel fuel for a mere

2.5 cents per gallon -- only half the cost estimated by EPA and

far below the even-higher costs projected by doomsday-sayers in

the oil industry.

<p>The EIA study was requested last summer by key members of the

House Science Committee, "who were obviously biased against the

cleanup," said O'Donnell. He noted those members, led by Rep.

James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), told EIA that they believed EPA

had not adequately studied the potential impacts of the diesel

cleanup.

<p>"Once again, it appears that EIA is being used as a tool by

those who seek to portray environmental protection as an

obstacle to energy production," said O'Donnell. He noted that

Vice President Cheney relied on an earlier EIA report in his

recent call for a massive expansion of energy production

facilities.
