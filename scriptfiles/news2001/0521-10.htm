- May 21 - ALLEGRA PACHECO, <a href="mailto:pacheco@radcliffe.edu">pacheco@radcliffe.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.nigelparry.com">http://www.nigelparry.com</a><br>

An American/Israeli Jewish human rights lawyer who represents Palestinians 

in the West Bank, Pacheco is now a Peace Fellow at the Bunting Institute at 

Harvard/Radcliffe. She said today: &quot;In calling for the end of the building 

of settlements on occupied territory, the Mitchell report is calling for 

Israel to stop an illegal act. There shouldn't be any debate on that. Last 

week the Red Cross, which is the official arbiter of the Geneva 

Conventions, said that settlement building constitutes a war crime. The 

U.S. State Department responded by saying that the Red Cross was 'not being 

helpful.' Such contempt for international humanitarian law by the U.S. 

government seriously undermines the force of basic human rights principles. 

It also illustrates why the U.S. is losing its moral credibility worldwide, as we saw most recently when it was voted off the UN Human Rights Commission.&quot;</font>

Hassan is co-author of the recently released National Lawyers Guild report 

titled &quot;The Al Aqsa Intifida and Israel's Apartheid: The U.S. Military and 

Economic Role in the Violation of Palestinian Human Rights.&quot; She said 

today: &quot;Federal law requires the termination of all foreign assistance to 

Israel&#133;. Under the Arms Export Control Act, Israel is permitted to use U.S. 

military assistance solely for 'legitimate self-defense' and 'internal 

security.'&quot;</font></p>

Editor of Tikkun magazine, Rabbi Lerner said today: &quot;The Mitchell report's 

notion of freezing the building of settlements and calling for an end to 

the violence in exchange misses the point that the settlements are 

themselves a major source of the violence. The Palestinian uprising is in 

response to the occupation...&quot;</font></p>

Vice president of the Arab-American Action Network, Abunimah said today: &#147;The Bush administration has been pretending that it has been taking a 

'hands-off' approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In fact, by 

continuing to supply weapons, funds and diplomatic protection -- like 

vetoing a UN protection force -- to Israel, the Bush administration, like 

its predecessors, has been fueling the conflict.&quot;</font></p>

Communications director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 

Committee, Ibish said today: &quot;The deteriorating cycle of violence between 

Israelis and Palestinians must be seen in its context -- Israel's 

occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Because of this 

occupation, Palestinians have endured for 34 years almost everything 

suffered by black South Africans -- including political disempowerment, impoverishment, dependence on work and travel permits, curfews, land 

confiscations, home demolitions and living under separate and unequal legal 

systems. Israel refuses to end its occupation, Palestinians refuse to 

endure it.&quot;</font></p>
