<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO 

- July 10 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>WHAT: </b>Outraged by the apparent &quot;lovefest&quot; between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the petroleum industry, a broad coalition of environmentalists will present a letter of concerns at the BLM's 2001 National Petroleum Forum (Forum) demanding a meaningful participation in working groups on petroleum production on public lands. Despite the Forum's supposed goal of &quot;broad outreach to all stakeholders,&quot; to consider &quot;nationwide public lands issues related to petroleum exploration, development and production,&quot; the Forum is better characterized as an industry/BLM strategy session where &quot;all interested parties&quot; are limited exclusively to oil and gas interests. </font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHO:</b> The environmental coalition includes Bluewater Network, Californians for Western Wilderness, Center for Biological Diversity, Environmental Defense, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oil &amp; Gas Accountability Project, Wyoming Outdoor Council, and others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHERE:</b> Holiday Inn Capitol Plaza, 300 J Street, Sacramento, CA. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: Thursday, July 12, 2001. Welcome at 8:00am. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHY:</b> &quot;It is outrageous that the petroleum industry has effectively bought exclusive advisory rights to the BLM,&quot; said Katy Rexford of Bluewater Network. Past Petroleum Forums have resulted in working groups that have issued Instructional Memoranda advising BLM to issue new drilling permits without environmental analyses in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Other activities of the industry working group include preparation of BLM documents, field reviews of wildlife mortality, preparation of planning data, and review of best practices policies. &quot;I have repeatedly and publicly requested that the BLM seek out and include a diverse range of groups, individuals, and agency employees who are interested in public land management. Instead, it looks like BLM dedicated its efforts to providing the industry pressure groups direct access to the BLM oil and gas decision-makers&quot;, said Travis Stills of the Oil and Gas Accountability Project. Not only did BLM exclude the environmental community, but also agency personnel with expertise in biology, wildlife, water and air quality, and all other disciplines. &quot;A forum where BLM has three panels all of which are 100% oil and gas interests is supposed to represent all stakeholders? BLM and industry have to ask themselves who they think they are fooling,&quot; said Tom Darin of the Wyoming Outdoor Council. </font></p>
