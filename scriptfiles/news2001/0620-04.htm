- June 20 - ACORN is campaigning against the unfair and abusive lending 

practices of Household Finance, a company that also works under the 

name Beneficial. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today ACORN is filing complaints with regulatory agencies in 

several states. In each state, ACORN will be reporting cases of 

predatory lending and requesting that the state take action against 

Household. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For copies of the complaints, or to speak with borrowers, 

contact David Swanson at 202-547-2500. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACORN has already filed complaints in New York, Missouri and 

Minnesota. In Missouri, the state attorney general and the banking 

commissioner have begun looking into the matter. Today ACORN will 

be filing complaints in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, 

Pennsylvania, New Mexico and the District of Columbia. ACORN will 

file complaints in California on Friday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Household's practices are very similar to those for which the 

Federal Trade Commission is prosecuting the Associates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Household Finance is guilty of a widespread pattern of unfair 

business practices, aggressively and deceptively marketing loans 

that cheat homeowners out of their savings and their equity, 

especially low- and moderate-income, elderly, and minority 

families,&quot; said ACORN National President Maude Hurd. &quot;We are 

reporting these cases, and we are going to follow up to make sure 

something is done about them.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Household &amp; Beneficial's abusive lending practices include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Financing over priced &quot;single premium&quot; credit insurance into 

borrowers' loans, often without their understanding of what they 

have been sold. 

-- Charging high fees and interest rates unrelated to borrower's 

credit risk 

-- Refinancing loans and collecting excessive points and fees, 

when these refinancings only hurt the borrower. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Household makes its loans through aggressive and deceptive sales 

techniques. Some borrowers report having been promised lower 

payments, only to face higher ones, still more are unaware of some 

of the most abusive terms of their loans. They do not know they 

have been sold credit insurance, or they do not know how expensive 

it is and how little it does for them. They do not know their loans 

have prepayment penalties, and have often been assured that they do 

not. They do not know that they could have qualified for less 

expensive loans. </font></p>
