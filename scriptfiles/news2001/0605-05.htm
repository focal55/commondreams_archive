- June 5 - At today's City Council meeting, the Silicon Valley Toxics

Coalition will urge the Council to postpone signing a contract with Calpine

until appropriate health studies on the use of the recycled water for

Calpine's cooling towers are performed.

 

&quot;For more than one year, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) has

requested the City of San Jose to test the recycled water for harmful

health effects&quot;, said Ted Smith, SVTC Executive Director.  &quot;There is a

simple test that we have asked the city to undertake to ensure that the

recycled water is safe. To date, the city has declined to do these tests.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last several years, scientists have been increasingly concerned

about the impact that low-level exposure to dangerous chemicals can have

not only on the reproductive capacity of humans and other animals, but also

on their offspring.   The  state-of-the-art multi-generational fish test

advocated by SVTC is designed to determine whether the chemicals in the

recycled water could cause harmful effects on generations and populations

of species, including humans.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Metcalf Road Calpine power plant will evaporate up to 3 million gallons

of recycled water a day through the cooling towers of the plant.  This

water will be dispersed into the air and much of it will settle into the

percolation ponds that are the main entryway to the groundwater drinking

system (aquifers) for much of San Jose.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We recognize that the energy crisis is driving the decision making on this

project, but that should not be used as a rationale to make a snap decision

that may have irreversible effects on the health of San Jose residents,&quot;

said Ted Smith.  &quot;Greater research is needed before such a potentially life-

altering decision can be made in good conscience.&quot;</font></p>
