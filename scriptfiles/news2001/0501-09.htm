- May 1 - Ignoring advice from fishery scientists and environmental organizations, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) gave final approval Friday to a measure allowing scallop fishing vessels to drag heavy metal dredges through environmentally-sensitive marine habitats off New England and the Mid-Atlantic.  The measure becomes effective May 1, 2001.



<p>The approved measure, known as Framework Adjustment 14, modifies the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan (FMP) to allow for 120 days of fishing annually for full-time scallop vessels for the 2001 and 2002 fishing years.  Framework 14 also allows scallop dredging in areas of the Mid-Atlantic that had been closed to protect young scallops.  The measure was initially approved by the New England Fishery Management Council on January 26 despite concerns raised by fishery scientists, environmental groups and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about the quality of the environmental impact analysis prepared for this "framework adjustment" to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP.  The council, which is dominated by fishing industry representatives, also failed to implement measures scientists and environmentalists say are necessary to protect immature scallops and juvenile cod habitat from scallop dredging.



<p>"By approving Framework 14, the National Marine Fisheries Service has shirked its responsibility to ensure that fragile marine habitats receive protection from the devastating effects of scallop dredging," said Chris Zeman, Fisheries Program Counsel and New England Field Representative for American Oceans Campaign (AOC).  "NMFS and the New England Council have turned a blind eye to their legal responsibility to adequately analyze and minimize the environmental impacts of commercial scallop dredging. "



<p>During the public comment period, AOC and the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) submitted extensive comments on Framework 14 and its environmental analyses to fishery managers, outlining its deficiencies and showing the need to prohibit scallop dredging in hard-bottom habitats to protect juvenile cod habitat.  In addition, NMFS and the New England Council received hundreds of letters from concerned citizens in New England and nationwide requesting a proper environmental analysis and immediate action to protect sensitive marine habitats from scallop dredging.  "It is apparent from NMFS's decision to approve Framework 14 that AOC's concerns, and those of the public, again fell on deaf ears," said Zeman.



<p>While the original purpose of Framework 14 was to ensure the protection of young scallops and thus promote the growth and abundance of the resource, the New England Council elected not to close known scallop nursery areas to dredging.  Framework 14, as approved, also provides little protection to habitat critical to the rebuilding socks of valuable groundfish, including Georges Bank cod.



<p>"We cheered the New England Council when it announced its intention to conduct a full environmental analysis for Framework 14," said CLF Marine Scientist Anthony Chatwin, Ph.D.  "The analysis they prepared, however, is a far cry from what is required by federal environmental laws.  The fact that the council chose the alternative that will result in the highest amount of bycatch and provide the least benefits to habitat is the clear result of not having the proper environmental analyses in hand at the time of the decision.  We are disappointed that NMFS did not modify Framework 14 to include reasonable conservation measures before giving it their seal of approval."



<p>In written comments to the New England Council, the U.S. EPA also concluded that the environmental analyses prepared for Framework 14 contained insufficient information to properly evaluate the measure's environmental consequences and failed to evaluate all reasonable alternatives to minimize environmental impacts.  However, the New England Council took action without revising the environmental analyses, and only modified the analyses one month after taking final action.  "Federal law requires that decision makers be given adequate environmental analyses before taking final action," added Zeman. "Completing the analysis after the decision does nothing to promote better environmental decision making.  By approving Framework 14, NMFS has sent the message that it is okay to fish first and fully assess the consequences later, even when the long-term productivity of our fisheries is at stake."



<p>The New England Scallop fishery comprises over 250 full-time vessels.  These vessels are commonly over 100 feet long and use two 15-foot steel-framed scallop dredges to catch scallops.  These dredges each weigh over a ton and are dragged on the sea floor.  In addition to catching scallops, they also destroy plants, crabs, starfish, groundfish, skates and other bottom-dwelling species that make up the seafloor community.  In 1999, scallop vessels used their 120 fishing days to cover an area more than 12,000 square nautical miles-an area equal to the size of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts combined.  Much of the area affected by the scallop fishery has been designated as essential fish habitat for one or more commercially-managed species.
