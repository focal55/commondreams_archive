<font size="2">FERC Continues to Let Energy Companies

Charge Exorbitant Prices, Make Huge Profits</font></div>

- June 18 - As the federal government prepares to extend limits on electricity prices in California and other Western states, consumer groups said the government's actions are not likely to offer much relief to Western consumers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is scheduled to meet this afternoon to consider further steps to monitor the Western electricity problem. But Consumers Union (CU) and Consumer Federation of America (CFA) said the commission's plans will reportedly fall far short of what is needed to keep electricity prices at a reasonable level.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The companies that generate electricity have been holding back supply in order to run up prices and make big profits,&quot; said Adam Goldberg, policy analyst at CU. &quot;The federal government has refused to step in and stop this price gouging. If FERC proceeds as expected today, it will continue to let companies get away with price gouging, and consumers will continue to pay outrageous prices.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FERC is widely expected to extend current price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week in states throughout the West. But it is clear that the commission will not fix other systemic problems that have cost consumers billions of dollars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The changes FERC announces today will have some impact - instead of being overcharged by $50 billion a year for electricity, consumers will now only be overcharged $25 billion,&quot; said Dr. Mark Cooper, CFA's Director of Research. &quot;Is that an improvement? Yes. Is that acceptable? No.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers Union filed a petition at FERC on June 15 to ask that it impose cost-based electricity rates for the western United States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;FERC should set prices based on each generator's cost of producing power,&quot; said Goldberg. &quot;That's the way it works in most industries. Why should electricity be any different? FERC has been content to take baby steps in response to runaway prices in California, but consumers can't keep waiting for this agency to walk while runaway prices keep eating at their pocketbooks. That's why we filed the petition.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;FERC sets its so-called ceiling price at the cost of the least efficient generator paying the highest price for natural gas and pollution credits. That means the vast majority of generators make a windfall profit,&quot; added Cooper. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups accused FERC of dragging its feet in investigating substantial and credible reports of market manipulation by a few powerful companies to the detriment of millions of individual and commercial consumers. The groups said if such an investigation uncovers that prices have been unjust and unreasonable, the agency must order that excess profits be returned to the consumers that were being gouged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the FERC won't go back to cost-based rates,&quot; Cooper said, &quot;it must put a lot more teeth into its mitigation plan or little good will come of it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups said FERC must take the following actions to fully and effectively protect consumers:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Today's price mitigation order must cover transactions 24 hours per day, seven days a week, not just in emergency situations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The order must cover all of the states in the Western States Coordinating Council, not just California.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The order must deal with &quot;megawatt laundering.&quot; Energy companies must not be allowed to sell power outside the region, only to import it back in with no restrictions on the price they can charge. In policing megawatt laundering, FERC must not only ask for data, but must use that data in fashioning real remedies when megawatt laundering is found to have occurred.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. The California Independent System Operator, not FERC, must be the entity that determines whether generating facilities are available to generate required electricity for the market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

5. All rates must be subject to refund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. The order must be retroactive to October 2, 2000, when San Diego first lodged its complaint regarding wholesale electricity prices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. &quot;Negawatt&quot; sales by electricity customers must be made to utilities, not energy merchants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In addition to these mitigation steps, FERC must also: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Restore order to the natural gas market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Engage in rulemaking on a rational approach to granting market-based rates to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future and become more active in designing market-based systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Find a new policing mechanism to ensure that markets function properly, a task that FERC has failed to carry out effectively since the start of electricity restructuring. </font></p>
