- June 20 - The National Organization for Women (NOW) stands with members of Congress and

other allies to reverse a dangerous trend that threatens to set back women&#146;s

and civil rights gains in employment more than 35 years. It's called mandatory

arbitration, and earlier this spring, a bare majority of the U.S. Supreme

Court

gave it an unwise and unwarranted boost.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On March 21, 2001, five members of the U.S. Supreme Court said in Circuit City

v. St. Clair Adams that employers could require employees to check their

rights

at the door as the price of admission to the workplace. Unless overturned by

Congress, the Circuit City decision will restrict workers' rights to sue for

damages related to job discrimination, harassment and other abuses. We must

have congressional action to remedy this injustice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW strongly supports Senator Russ Feingold and Congress members John Conyers,

Dennis Kucinich, Barney Frank, and Ed Markey, along with dozens of their

colleagues, in their determination to amend federal law in language so clear

that even these five justices cannot mistake the meaning: workers cannot be

coerced into giving up their rights on the job and their access to courts to

enforce those rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mandatory arbitration is nothing more than a way for employers to evade the

stricter civil rights law enacted after Anita Hill raised the nation&#146;s

consciousness about sexual harassment. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 for the

first time gave women the right to a trial by jury and damages in employment

discrimination cases under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In addition

to providing compensatory damages as a remedy for the employee, the 1991 act

also allows limited punitive damages as a deterrent to employers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new law&#146;s provisions raised the stakes for employers and gave them a new

incentive to find ways around it. Increasingly, other employers have looked

with envy at the securities industry's notorious system of mandatory

arbitration. Employers as different as JC Penney and Hooters are now imposing

this unfair system on their employees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mandatory arbitration systems are often stacked against the employee.  Some do

not allow employees to have their own attorneys at the arbitration

proceedings;

others give employers the sole right to choose the arbitrators. Many companies

disallow discovery, the ability of the employee to subpoena relevant documents

and other evidence prior to the hearing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employees may face a panel of arbitrators with no experience, interest or

expertise in equal employment or other laws that cover workers on the job.

They

are less likely to be fully compensated for the damage they have suffered or

the attorneys fees and costs of the arbitration; indeed, they often face

arbitration fees that are many times what a court&#146;s filing fees would be,

sometimes paying even more than the damages they are awarded. Except in cases

of extreme legal error, the employees have no ability to appeal the outcome of

the arbitration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only way employees can potentially have their day in court is to team up

and form a class to challenge the company in federal court. But this strategy

means finding enough people with similar complaints who are willing to

participate; and class actions are often difficult to organize, expensive to

litigate and disfavored by judges.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mandatory arbitration can also work to the disadvantage of employers.

Class-action suits are also costly for them. In addition, with no public

record

of trial verdicts or appellate decisions and no definitive, predictable

interpretation of the laws, employers also are hard-pressed to anticipate what

they are allowed and not allowed to do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If proponents of arbitration are correct in their argument that it is faster,

cheaper and better than the judicial system, then surely employees and their

attorneys will opt for arbitration in a voluntary system. However, those

plaintiffs who wish to file their complaints in a court of law must not be

denied that opportunity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Organization for Women will not rest until arbitration is

optional

for every employee. We challenge every member of Congress: Reaffirm your

commitment to this country&#146;s equal employment opportunity laws. Open the doors

for those who are locked out of court and restore their right to make their

cases before an impartial judge and a jury of peers.
