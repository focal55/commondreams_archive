that tomorrow the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will announce a $9

billion deficit for this year. The Billionaires for Public Plunder are also

elated that President Bush has declared the Social Security surplus no

longer off limits. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gathering in town squares across the nation this afternoon, members of

Billionaires for Public Plunder symbolically smashed lock boxes, tossing

thousand dollar bills in the air as startled passersby stared.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Why raid our own trust funds when we can raid yours?" asked

spokesbillionaire Robbin DeHood. "Giving us the bulk of the tax cut was a

good start. Dropping the lock box campaign promise was a great next step.

But in our quest to put everything up for sale, we won¹t stop until we can

rake in fees from every single private Social Security account. After all

we¹ve done for this government, by buying it only the best politicians, why

should millions of baby boomers retire without us getting a cut?"



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Billionaires for Public Plunder plan to send a solid gold lock box,

symbolically open and empty, to the White House as a thank-you gift to

President Bush. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This is what we plan to tell the president: Pay no attention to those

alarmists at the CBO," said Phil T. Rich. "They are totally beholden to the

voters, which skews their priorities toward pedestrian concerns such as

education and prescription drugs. The surplus has gone just where it should

have ­ into our pockets."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Republican and Democratic conventions last summer, the Billionaires

were out in full force, holding a Million Billionaire March to demonstrate

their influence over the candidates and show off their fiscal prowess. They

were featured in the Washington Post, Philadelphia Inquirer, Boston Globe,

BBC, and Time Magazine. Once election season was over, the Billionaires

began to focus on winning tax cuts for themselves, declaring victory when

the estate tax was repealed for the year 2010.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robbin DeHood, Phil T. Rich, Millie O'Nair and other representatives of

Billionaires for Public Plunder are available for interviews.

for a Fair Economy (UFE) to draw attention to the connection between the

Bush tax cut, the shrinking surplus, campaign finance, and economic

inequality.

defeat by the Billionaires.
