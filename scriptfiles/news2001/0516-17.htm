- May 16 - U.S. public interest groups today applauded the European

Parliament which passed a law requiring manufacturers of electrical and

electronic equipment to reduce hazardous substances and to pay for the

recycling of their products. The law, passed yesterday, despite industry

opposition, covers practically every electrical item from hairdryers to

personal computers. It is the second EU policy that requires producers to

take responsibility for their products when they are scrapped. (The first

law was for autormobiles.) </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discarded electronic equipment--particularly computers and their

components--creates growing mountains of junk electronics scrap in the

industrialized world, due to the increasing sales and rapid product

obsolescence. Until recently, few in the U.S. paid attention to this problem. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Electronic equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals,

toxic materials and organic pollutants in municipal trash waste,&quot; said

Leslie Byster of Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. &quot;The new European law

sets high standards for producer responsibility and tougher requirements

for attaining higher recycling rates. If the high-tech companies in Europe

can follow the Directive, there is no reason to believe that they can't

follow the same practices in the U.S. and elsewhere.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The intent of the law is to make producers design environmentally

friendlier products with less hazardous substances that can be more easily

reused or recycled. The new EU law requires: 1) producers to pay for

recycling of their &quot;obsolete&quot;  products, 2) more aggressive recycling (an

increase from  from 50% to 70%), 3) producers to pay for collecting waste

equipment from households, as well as for recycling and disposing of it,

and 4) more stringent requirements to further promote design for the

environment, phase out of toxic materials and resource efficiency thinking. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the US, most &quot;obsolete&quot; electronic products are not recycled.  The

expense of collecting, managing and disposing of discarded electronics --

including household hazardous waste collection and hazardous waste site

cleanup -- is usually borne by taxpayer-funded government programs,

primarily at the local level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We strongly support the E.U. initiative  which makes producers ultimately

responsible for the electronic products they manufacture.  US taxpayers

should not have to pay for electronic waste collection, recycling and

disposal,&quot; said Michael Bender of the Mercury Policy Project. &quot;Having

producers assume responsibility creates a powerful incentive to design

products that are cleaner and safer; more durable, reusable, repairable,

upgradable; and easier to disassemble and recycle.&quot; </font></p>
