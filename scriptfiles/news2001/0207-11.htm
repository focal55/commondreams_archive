- February 7 -  Today's alleged shooting by Robert Pickett with a handgun 

        at the White House is the latest incident starkly illustrating the need 

        for a ban on the most deadly categories of firearms—small, easily concealable 

        handguns and high-powered assault weapons—the Violence Policy Center stated 

        today. The VPC is a national organization working to reduce gun death 

        and injury in America and is the only gun control organization that actively 

        works for a national handgun ban. 

      <P>The White House shooting follows by two days a workplace shooting at 

        a Navistar engine assembly plant in Melrose Park, Illinois, in which a 

        former employee, William D. Baker, opened fire with a handgun and an SKS 

        assault rifle. Baker killed four and hospitalized three before taking 

        his own life. In the past two weeks alone, caches of weapons held by college 

        and high school students planning copycat shootings similar to the 1999 

        Columbine massacre have been found by law enforcement officials in California 

        and Kansas. 

      <P>Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center and 

        author of the new book <i>Every Handgun is Aimed at You: The Case for 

        Banning Handguns</i> (The New Press/March 2001) states, "The single bloody 

        thread that runs through these incidents is the easy accessability we 

        allow our citizens to the most lethal categories of weapons, such as handguns. 

        After these shootings a predictable pattern emerges, we quickly look for 

        a loophole to be plugged, a limited law that could be better enforced, 

        or other `common sense' solutions, while never stepping back to look at 

        the big picture: the freeflow of guns in our nation. America's gun violence 

        problem will not be solved by licensing and registration, trigger locks, 

        or lamentations over the evil in men's hearts. It will be solved only 

        when we look at the tools that make such violence possible. To paraphrase: 

        It's the guns, stupid." 

      <P><i>The Violence Policy Center is a 

        national non-profit educational foundation that conducts research on violence 

        in America and works to develop violence-reduction policies and proposals. 

        The Center examines the role of firearms in America, conducts research 

        on firearms violence, and explores new ways to decrease firearm-related 

        death and injury. </i>
