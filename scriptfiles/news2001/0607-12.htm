- June 7 - On June 6 and 7, the Indonesian government conducted a procedure throughout 

the refugee camps in West Timor. One stated objective was to allow each 

family to choose whether to be resettled in Indonesia or to return to East 

Timor, their homeland from which they were forcibly abducted 21 months ago. 

However, this process was ill-conceived, illegitimately executed, and 

conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation without meaningful oversight or 

participation by the international community. The results of the 

registration must therefore be rejected, no matter how much the two-day 

process appeared to be smooth and free of civil disturbance.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The approximately 80,000 refugees languishing in squalid refugee camps 

urgently need the international community to help provide for their 

immediate needs and to ensure that they can freely choose whether to 

repatriate to East Timor or resettle in Indonesia. The United Nations 

conducted the 1999 election, while leaving security in the hands of the 

Indonesian military, thereby creating the conditions which forced these 

refugees from their homeland, and the U.N. should acknowledge its 

responsibility to enable them to rebuild their lives. This week&#146;s exercise 

was totally inadequate, and we reiterate our call for a genuine, 

internationally-conducted registration conducted after the militia 

organizations have been disarmed, disbanded, prevented from pressuring the 

refugees, and not involved in future registrations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intimidation by the Indonesian military and the militias they created has 

been a fact of life for the refugees since before they were evicted from 

East Timor nearly two years ago. That alone invalidates this week&#146;s 

process, and the international community should be ashamed of allowing it 

to proceed under these conditions. The following are specific points which 

demonstrate the fraudulent nature of the Indonesian government&#146;s refugee 

registration:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Intimidation</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Indonesia brought an additional 4,500 military from other parts of 

Indonesia to West Timor to enforce order during the registration. These 

soldiers, operating under shoot-to-kill orders, recall the 24 years of 

Indonesian military occupation of East Timor which resulted in 200,000 East 

Timorese deaths and which was resoundingly rejected in the August 30, 1999 

referendum. The impunity enjoyed by military officers and militia leaders 

who committed crimes against humanity in East Timor from 1975 to 1999, and 

in West Timor since then, allows them to continue terrorizing East Timorese 

refugees. Reports, including those from Indonesian authorities, describe 

militias forcing people either to &#147;vote&#148; for resettlement or not at all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Militia members and camp coordinators in several camps told 

refugees that those who opt for repatriation would be kidnapped instead of 

being allowed to return to East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Only a handful of foreign journalists went to West Timor to cover 

the registration. If well-protected and highly visible reporters were not 

brave enough to venture into the territory, what does it say about the 

climate of fear for refugees who live there under continuous scrutiny of 

pro-integration armed men, under the control of militia and Indonesian 

soldiers?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Distortion and lack of information about the process</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       The very nature of the process was confusing to all. Was this a 

count of the refugee population, a poll to determine what percentage 

planned to repatriate, a re-vote of the 1999 referendum, or an individual 

choice by each person to return or resettle? One thing was clear  the 

Indonesian authorities, and therefore the militia leaders, will know how 

each person &#147;voted.&#148; In many cases, registrants displayed their marked 

ballots or marked the ballot without going into the private booth, proving 

that they had chosen the red-and-white.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Posters explaining the process were not displayed in the Kupang and 

TTS district camps, but only 200 m outside, and only for 1-2 days before 

the registration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       UNTAS (Uni Timor Aswain, pro-integration coalition which includes 

the militias) worked closely with the Indonesian authorities, &#147;translating&#148; 

official registration information from Bahasa Indonesia to Tetum for the 

refugees. For example, in a Noelbaki camp meeting on 2 June, UNTAS people 

stressed to the refugees that now was the time for the refugees to show how 

much they love the red and white (Indonesian flag colors).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       In Tuapukan camp (and perhaps elsewhere), an official told refugees 

the registration was not just going on in West Timor, but also in East 

Timor. He said that the process was a re-administration of the 1999 

referendum, and that East Timor will again become part of Indonesia if more 

people there East Timor wanted to live in Indonesia than an independent 

East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Coercion</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       A pervasive, systematic campaign of disinformation has been 

underway for months to make the refugees believe that East Timor is filled 

with starvation, vigilante retaliation against pro-integration people, 

shortages, and other hardships and dangers. Militias have organized visits 

to camps by refugees from other areas in West Timor who pretend to report 

on terrible conditions in East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Although Indonesian authorities did not distribute rice and 

monetary allowances to refugees for the past three months, they distributed 

rice in at least two camps just hours before the registration. They 

promised more rice after registration was completed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ubiquitous irregularities</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       There are widespread reports of West Timorese locals 

misrepresenting themselves as East Timorese refugees and registering, often 

for money (Rp. 100,000 is typical) or because they were told they would 

receive food if they registered, as part of an effort to increase the 

numbers registering and the percentage choosing resettlement in Indonesia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       Nobody under 17 years old was allowed to register. Consequently, 

adult men decided for all people in their households (often telling adult 

women how to register) whether to repatriate or remain in Indonesia. Many 

families were systematically divided by militia in September 1999 when they 

were taken to West Timor, and most refugee children are being cared for by 

adults from their village who ended up in the same camp.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       There were only 12 international observers for 507 registration 

sites, and they visited each site, with military escort, for only a brief 

time. West Timorese humanitarian and human rights NGOs who wanted to 

observe the registration were denied credentials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       At some sites, there was not enough indelible ink to mark 

registrants&#146; hands, and stamp-pad ink was used instead. This allowed people 

to wash it off with water and register a second or third time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       At many sites in Tuapukan and Noelbaki, among others, registration 

staffers could not speak Tetum and were unable to explain the process or 

answer questions asked by registrants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       A news report quoted the registration organizing committee&#146;s media 

center that 9,226 out of 9,533 voters chose resettlement, with only 277 

choosing repatriation. Not only is 97% choice for resettlement wildly 

inconsistent with the experience of anyone who has spoken with the 

refugees, but the total number is perhaps one-fourth of the number of adult 

refugees. On the other hand 140,000 ballots were distributed, several times 

what would be needed to register all the adult refugees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&sect;       The registration was rushed to meet UNTAET&#146;s timetable for August 

30 Constituent Assembly elections in East Timor, for which voters are 

required to register by June 20. Both timetables are unrealistic and do not 

allow sufficient time, given the necessary political will, for West Timor 

to conduct a refugee registration free of intimidation, followed by 

repatriation of those who wish it, followed by civic education and voter 

registration for East Timor&#146;s first election.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are deeply disturbed that the United Nations is participating in this 

sham refugee registration by providing funds and an observer, and that 

UNTAET declared that the process appears successful merely because little 

violence was initially reported on the first registration day. As the calm 

East Timor voting day of August 30, 1999 vividly demonstrated, the military 

and militia can turn their violence off and on. If no major incident occurs 

while West Timor is under international scrutiny for a few days, that says 

nothing about prior intimidation or subsequent retaliation which is the 

experience and the terror of the East Timorese refugees and inevitably 

influences their decisions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For all these reasons, the refugee registration process conducted by 

Indonesia this week must be soundly rejected. The United Nations and the 

international community have accepted Indonesia&#146;s hollow promises and 

dangerous charades too many times  and left the East Timorese people to 

bear the bloody consequences. This time, they must do better.
