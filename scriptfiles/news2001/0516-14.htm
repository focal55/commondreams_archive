- May 16 - "Congress has proved once again that it is unwilling to stand up to

George W. Bush's assault on women's reproductive rights," said NOW Executive

Vice President Kim Gandy.&nbsp; "Women in the U.S. and around the world

stand to lose access to critical health services at the hands of this Congress

and this president."

<p>Today the House of Representatives voted 218 to 210 to uphold one of

George W. Bush's first actions in office–the reinstatement of the global

gag rule.&nbsp; The full House struck an amendment added to the State Department

authorization bill by the House International Relations Committee.&nbsp;

The amendment would have overturned Bush's executive order and resumed

funding to international family planning organizations that offer abortion

counseling or services.

<p>"Doctors everywhere must be allowed to give women patients complete

and medically-sound information," said Gandy.&nbsp; "Hundreds of thousands

of women with unplanned pregnancies die every year due to complications

in pregnancy and childbirth.&nbsp; The U.S. can do much through its aid

to family planning programs to reduce that toll."

<p>The State Department bill will move next to the Senate where reproductive

rights supporters may choose to add a similar amendment.&nbsp; If language

repealing the global gag rule makes it to the president's desk, however,

he has threatened to veto it.

<p>On April 22 NOW kicked off its Emergency Campaign for Women's Lives

with a rally and march outside the capitol.&nbsp; The campaign will draw

strength from the majority of people who support abortion rights and birth

control and will combat four years of expected legislation, judicial appointments

and executive actions that limit women's reproductive freedom.

<p>"George W. Bush and his friends in Congress can continue turning their

backs on women, but not without a price.&nbsp; When they put women's lives

at risk, they also put their political futures at risk," Gandy said.
