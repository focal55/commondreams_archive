Russell is a member of the Health GAP Coalition. She said today: "With the Cipro deal,

Secretary Thompson did not want to set a precedent that could be used against

the U.S. administration at the upcoming WTO meeting, where the issue of

affordable AIDS drugs and patent rights in poor countries will be a major

controversy. If U.S. officials had agreed to license production of generic

ciprofloxacin, all their arguments against patent flexibility in poor countries

seeking generic AIDS drugs would have fallen to pieces -- and Robert Zoellick,

the U.S. Trade Representative, wouldn't tolerate that, no matter how high the

stakes. Thousands die daily from untreated AIDS globally, and Zoellick is

blocking the use of common-sense strategies among poor countries to promote

generic AIDS drug access."

Director of the Consumer Project on Technology, Love said: "Thompson says we need

medications for 10 million persons. At the 120-pill recommended course of

treatment for ciprofloxacin, this is 1.2 billion pills. Bayer says it can

produce 2 million per day. At this rate it would take 600 days to supply 1.2

billion pills. The U.S. is now saying it will only provide 10 doses of

ciprofloxacin, and then switch to a cheaper antibiotic.... Apparently five

generic companies have already received U.S. FDA clearance for the quality of

their ciprofloxacin, and could immediately be asked to manufacture the drug.

The U.S. government already has the right to use patents without a license. The

U.S. can clearly address supply issues faster with six suppliers than with one.

The government is cutting corners on public health to protect its negotiating

position in the Doha WTO meeting on November 9-13 -- where the issue of

compulsory licensing of drugs, and imports under a compulsory license where a

country does not have domestic capacity for production, is a central issue,

with the U.S., Canada and the European Union opposing the Africa group.

Americans are being put at risk in order to protect the pharmaceutical

companies doing business in Africa and other developing countries."

Ideological Exclusion," Akram, associate professor at the Boston

University School of Law, has given legal assistance in cases where secret

"evidence" has been used by the government. She said today:

"This entire legislation is premised on the idea that we can get increased

security at the expense of our civil liberties -- that's historically never

been true and it's not true today." For more information: <A HREF="http://aclu.org" target="_new">www.aclu.org</A>

Senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, Chang said today: "Our commitment to the Bill of Rights and to the democratic values that define this nation is

under challenge. The legislation that the Senate is expected to pass today will

... discourage protest activities, further diminish our already reduced

expectations of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, and strip immigrants of

their fundamental right to freedom from bodily restraint without due process of

law. As constitutional challenges to the legislation wind their way through the

courts, the judiciary will be presented with the choice of upholding the

Constitution or acquiescing in its surrender."
