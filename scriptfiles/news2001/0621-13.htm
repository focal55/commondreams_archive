- June 21 - As Senators debate two competing patient protection bills, and powerful industry groups flood the airwaves with ads, the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families Action Fund today released a new 30-second television advertisement that emphasizes what American families have at stake in this debate. The 30-second spot will begin airing in the D.C.-market tomorrow. It features Dylan Malone, a father from Everett, Washington, whose son, Ian, was born with brain damage so severe that he needs full-time nursing care because he is unable to breathe or eat on his own. The Malone's health insurer initially denied coverage for Ian's care. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new spot was unveiled at a news conference here today featuring National Partnership President Judith L. Lichtman, American Nurses Association President Mary Foley, and Malone. He says in the ad: &quot;Ian's brain damage leaves him unable to eat or to breathe on his own. He could die at any time if he's not continuously observed. The insurance company told us to give Ian up for adoption and let the taxpayers step in and pay for his care. They didn't care. It was all about saving money.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The spot concludes: &quot;A real patients bill of rights would hold an insurance company [legally] accountable for their decisions. There's no reason why these multi-billion dollar companies should be above the law, and it's costing people's lives. Only one bill provides real protections. Support McCain-Kennedy-Edwards.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It would be easy to believe that this debate is about big business versus big business,&quot; Lichtman said, &quot;but it's really about ensuring that families like the Malone's get the protections they need and deserve. The 

Bi-Partisan Patient Protection Act of 2001 (S. 283), sponsored by Senators John McCain, John Edwards and Edward Kennedy, will provide the protections that Americans so urgently need. The Breaux/Frist alternative is a poor substitute that will do little to provide real protections. It's time for Congress to put the needs of patients ahead of corporate profits and pass a strong patient protection bill.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Partnership for Women &amp; Families is a non-profit, non-partisan advocacy group dedicated to promoting fairness in the workplace, quality health care and policies that help Americans balance the demands of work and family. The National Partnership leads the coalition of more than 300 health care and consumer organizations supporting passage of strong patient protection legislation. </i></font></p>
