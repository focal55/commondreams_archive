- November 7 - The Sierra Club announced the success of its

partnership with Charter Communications to provide the public with simple

ways to use less energy.  To communicate with the public, Charter

Communications has run two public service announcements at no charge as a

service to communities throughout its systems in California.  Since

mid-August, the conservation-oriented ads have run approximately 33,000

times at a value of  $1 million.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are running these public service announcements to help the public

understand that it is easy to make a difference during our nation's energy

shortages,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.  &quot;We are

thrilled that Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson, actor/director Harry Shearer

and Charter Communications are joining us in this effort.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Backstreet Boy Richardson, who also runs Just Within Reach: An Earth

Foundation, is featured encouraging residents to subscribe to green energy

and to use clean, renewable, energy resources such as solar power.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shearer, well known as the voice of Montgomery Burns and Ned Flanders on

the Simpsons and for his portrayal as bassist Derek Small in This is Spinal

Tap, is featured installing energy efficient lightbulbs and demonstrating

other energy saving tips.  &quot;The images of Shearer installing compact

fluorescent lightbulbs and unplugging power strips shows in a concrete way

that it is simple to use energy more efficiently,&quot; said Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Charter Communications is proud to offer our medium to help pass along and

promote important energy-saving tips during today's energy crisis,&quot; said

Tom Schaeffer, Senior Vice President of Operations for Charter

Communications Western Region. &quot;Partnering with the Sierra Club gives us an

opportunity to work with an organization that has a history of making a

difference and whose messages need to be heard by a broader audience.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Sierra Club believes that if we make the right energy choices today,

Americans can have cleaner air, less global warming pollution, beautiful

public lands and reasonably priced power far into the future,&quot; said Pope.

&quot;We need a balanced energy plan that gives us safer, cleaner, cheaper and

more efficient energy solutions. These ads begin to point us in that

direction.&quot;</font></p>
