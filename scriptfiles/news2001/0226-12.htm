<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - February 26 - On the eve of Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit with Indonesian Prime 

Minister Alwi Shihaband in a wave of fresh violence in the Indonesian 

province of Central Kalimantan, on Borneothe U.S.-based Indonesia Human 

Rights Network (IHRN) has urged the Bush Administration to stand strongly 

in support of Indonesian democratization and to maintain and strengthen the 

current congressional ban on U.S. aid to the Indonesian military.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Secretary Powell meets with Foreign Minister Shihab, we hope he will 

emphasize that Indonesian security forces and their allies are still 

perpetuating extreme human rights abuses in West Papua, Aceh, Maluku, and 

elsewhere,&quot; said Craig Harris, co-chair of IHRN's executive board.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One example, said Harris, is the September 2000 killing of three UN aid 

workers by military-backed militias in the Indonesian territory of West 

Timor.  In December, three human rights workers from the RATA, 

Rehabilitation Action for Torture Victims in Aceh, were pulled from their 

vehicle while working and shot in the street in the province of Aceh. The 

only known survivor of that incident attended a conference to launch IHRN, 

held February 23-25 in Washington, DC. &quot;There's no doubt in my mind that 

the men who took us hostage and killed my colleagues were military,&quot; said 

Nazaruddin Abdul Gani.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Before there can be any resumption of military ties between Washington and 

Jakarta, the Indonesian armed forces must undergo significant reform.  The 

U.S. government should accept nothing short of civilian control of the 

military as well as human rights trials conducted under international 

standards of justice as preconditions for any re-engagement with the 

Indonesian military,&quot; added IHRN co-chair Agatha Schmaedick.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesia Human Rights Network is a grassroots movement actively 

campaigning, through public education and national advocacy in support of 

the archipelago's pro-democracy movement and against U.S. complicity with 

Indonesian military repression. The network is comprised of human rights 

advocates, educators, and concerned citizens from across the U.S. and 

around the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Octavianus Mote, a West Papuan journalist who spoke at the IHRN conference, 

stated, &quot;The Indonesian military and government must respect international 

law in its actions.  In addition, the U.S. government should work to 

guarantee the safety of, and assistance to, the nearly one million refugees 

and displaced persons who have fled violence across the archipelago.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference featured experts on Indonesia from the U.S., Europe, 

Indonesia, East Timor, Australia, and elsewhere.  Jafar Siddiq Hamzah's 

sister dedicated the conference to her brother's memory.  Jafar was a human 

rights lawyer and permanent U.S. resident, kidnapped and murdered in 

Indonesia in August 2000.  He was working to end human rights abuses in his 

native Aceh and throughout Indonesia.</font></p>
