- February 7 -  The National Council of

Women's Organizations (NCWO) disputes new polling released today

claiming a majority of Americans support Individual Accounts

carved-out of Social Security. "Polls suggesting massive public

support leave out the fine print: taking money out of the system to

fund private accounts means cuts in guaranteed benefits for nearly

all Americans, increases in the retirement age, and less security for

spouses and widows," according to Heidi Hartmann, Ph.D, chair of the

Women &amp; Social Security Task Force of the National Council of Women's

Organizations.

<p>NCWO, in partnership with seven of its national member

organizations, will convene a Summit on Women and Social Security on

Feb. 8 at 8:30 a.m. at the Wyndham Washington D.C. (1400 M St., NW)

to launch a coordinated campaign to oppose Social Security

privatization.

<p>"These kind of misleading polls build on the obvious public

support for increasing their wealth in retirement while ignoring the

negative impact private accounts will have on the current system"

added Hartmann. "You can't maintain the current inflation-adjusted

guaranteed benefits that can't be outlived while at the same time

taking money out the of system to fund private accounts. The math

doesn't add up."

<p>Polling released to the public over the past year shows a dramatic

decline in support for private accounts once the trade-off is made

clear. According to a national poll, released in September 2000 by

AARP, "Support for carve-outs drops sharply when two potential

mitigating factors are introduced. If the approach brings with it a

reduction in guaranteed Social Security benefits or the possibility

of a new government agency, many Americans withdraw their support (55

percent and 58 percent, respectively)." The details of the poll can

be found at <a href="http://research.aarp.org/econ/sssurvey_1.html">http://research.aarp.org/econ/sssurvey_1.html</a>

<p>Beginning tomorrow morning, more than 300 leaders of grassroots

organizations representing all 50 states will participate in the two

days of meetings, training workshops, and Congressional office

visits. The attendees will deliver a unified message to Capitol Hill:

Individual Accounts carved-out of Social Security will hurt women and

families. The conference has been called because national women's

groups are concerned that privatization would necessarily jeopardize

the guarantee of lifetime, inflation-adjusted benefits that Social

Security now provides, and because rates of poverty among older women

are already unacceptably high.

<p>Speakers will include:

<p>-- Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Calif.), ranking member, Subcommittee on

Social Security of the Ways &amp; Means Committee, U.S. House of

Representatives
