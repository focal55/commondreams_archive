- April 26 - President Bush is out of step with Americans on the environment

and energy policy, according to a new poll.  The Sierra Club and the

Mellman Group today released a poll finding that after President Bush's first 100 days, most Americans do not trust President Bush to protect the

environment.

<p>

With an eye toward President Bush's mid-May release of his energy

proposals, the poll found that by a 2 to 1 margin Americans prefer to solve

our energy shortages by reducing demand rather than increasing supply.  In

addition, Americans strongly disapprove of President Bush's plans to drill

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and our national monuments.

<p>

"In his first one hundred days in office, President Bush rejected

safeguards that protect our families from arsenic in our drinking water and

broke his campaign pledge to curb global warming,"  said Carl Pope,

Executive Director of the Sierra Club.  "This poll shows that President<p>

Bush's anti-environmental actions are out of step with Americans' values.

Even people who voted for President Bush did not vote for more arsenic in

their water or more global warming pollution.  The mining, chemical and oil

industries that heavily funded his campaign got what they paid for, and as

a result, Americans do not trust President Bush to protect America's

environment for our families or for our future."

<p>

"President Bush's environmental policies are costing him public support,"

said Mark Mellman, President and CEO of the Mellman Group.  "The more these

issues are debated and the more the public learns, the greater the damage

to President Bush.  President Bush's job performance on the environment is

strikingly low, and Americans do not trust him to fight for them on

environmental issues."

<p>

To mark President Bush's first 100 days and to continue to track his

environmental actions, the Sierra Club will run national print

advertisements next week and will launch "W. watch," a website highlighting

President Bush's environmental record.  Sierra magazine will also feature

stories about President Bush's first 100 days.

<p>

President Bush has rejected a number of environmental safeguards and is losing credibility.  Overall, 58% of voters polled gave him a negative

rating for protecting the environment and only 27% gave him a positive

rating.  53% of those surveyed opposed President Bush's decision to change

the arsenic standards while only 32% agreed with it.  In addition, on

reducing carbon dioxide to curb global warming, half of those polled (50%)

believe President Bush reversed his position on emissions after intense lobbying from polluting industries.  Just 28% think he changed his position

because of legitimate policy concerns.

<p>

Americans disapprove of all elements of President Bush's anticipated energy

proposals.  48% of voters gave President Bush negative ratings for

developing an energy policy and 48% gave him negative ratings for

developing policies on oil drilling.  When voters were asked about a number

of President Bush's anticipated energy proposals, they opposed every one of

them.  For example, 57% opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife

Refuge and 35% supported it.  President Bush is likely to suggest drilling

off the coast of the United States and under the Great Lakes and 55%

opposed this measure and 37% favored this drilling.  Voters overwhelmingly

opposed relaxing air pollution standards to extend the life of power

plants, with 69% opposing relaxing standards and only 23% favoring it.

<p>

According to Pope: "The Bush plan won't solve America's energy problem, and

the public knows it.  What Americans understand is what we're proposing --

energy efficiency, renewable power and clean technologies --is actually quicker, cleaner, cheaper, safer and more reliable solutions."

<p>

The print ads will run in USA Today and in southern suburban newspapers.

Americans Didn't Vote for This

PRESIDENT BUSH:

As chief steward of America's environment, your job is to protect our water

and air, wild lands and wildlife. Yet since taking office, you've undercut

efforts to protect us from arsenic in the water, broken your promise to reduce the carbon pollution in our air, endorsed oil drilling and mining in

our national monuments, and asked to be placed above the laws that protect

America's wildlife. You are advocating drilling for oil in the Arctic -at

the same time your proposed budget cuts funding for renewable energy and

energy efficiency.

Yes, to be fair, you allowed stricter requirements on lead and measures to

protect some wetlands from development to stand. But on balance, your

actions have been bad for our health and bad for our future.

As you consider the fate of our wild forests, and prepare your energy plan

for the nation, we ask you to remember that overwhelming majorities of the

American people want the federal government to do more, not less, to

protect the environment. Americans are convinced that we can have reliable,

safe supplies of energy and a healthy economy without ruining our remaining

wild places and weakening pollution standards.

That's why once again, we're asking you to get in step with the values of

American people, to rise above partisan politics, and to resist the

pressure from your campaign contributors from the oil, gas and mining

industries. Be a leader. Protect our health and America's beauty, for our

families, for our future.
