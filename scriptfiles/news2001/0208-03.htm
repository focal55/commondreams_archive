- February 9 - Citing the most recent devastating analysis of President

Bush&#146;s Tax Cut proposal, U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN) today had harsh

words for the scheme which would leave out an estimated 12 million low- and

moderate-income families with 24 million children, and more than half of all

black and Hispanic children, from any of the benefits. Wellstone strongly

criticized the Bush plan for providing no benefit to nearly one in every three

U.S. families and their kids -- working families who most need the tax relief.  

&#147;In his inaugural speech President talked about &#145;leaving no child behind&#146;.  And

the President, in his education proposal, also spoke about &#145;leaving no child

behind&#146;.  I  think that is a wonderful value and a wonderful vision for our

country.  But where in this budget, where in the arithmetic of the tax cuts and

the surplus, will there be the investment to make sure that no child is left

behind?  I am sick and tired of symbolic politics when it comes children's

lives.  These tax cuts the President has proposed go overwhelmingly to the

wealthy, but leave working families and children out in the cold.  We will hold

the President and this administration accountable on the words, &#145;leave no child

behind&#146;,&#148; Wellstone said.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (<a href="http://www.cbpp.org">http://www.cbpp.org</a>)

released an analysis of the Bush Tax Cut plan showing:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An estimated 12.2 million low-and moderate-income families with children &#150; 31.5%

of all families &#150; would not receive any tax cut from the Bush proposal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Approximately 24.1 million children &#150; 33.5% of all children &#150; live in the

excluded families.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

More than half of black and Hispanic children live in families that would

receive nothing from the tax cut &#150; 55% of African -American children and 56% of

Hispanic children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 12 million families who get nothing from the Bush tax cut do not benefit

because they have no income tax liability before the Earned Income Tax is

computed.  These families still pay substantial amounts in other taxes, such as

the payroll tax and excise taxes.  For example, in 2001, a two-parent family of

four does not begin to owe income tax &#150; and thus does not begin to benefit from

the Bush plan &#150; until its income reaches $25,870, some 44% above the poverty

line of $17,950.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush proposal to double the child tax credit would be of little or no help

to many low-and moderate-income families.  Indeed, because the proposal would

provide benefits for the first time to families with incomes in the $110,000 to

$200,000 range, the proposed child credit expansion would confer a larger share

of its benefits on upper-income families than  on low- and middle-income

families.  The top 20% of families would get 46% of the tax-cut benefits from

this proposal, a larger share than any fifth of the population would receive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most working families pay taxes other than federal income taxes, often in

significant amounts.  In 1999, three quarters of all households paid more in

payroll taxes than in income taxes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone also blasted the Bush plan because it would squeeze out any chance for

investments in education, and a prescription drug benefit under Medicare; spend

Social Security and Medicare funds; spend projected surpluses that may never

materialize; risk a return to federal spending deficits and higher interest

rates, and also give fully 43% of the tax cut to Donald Trump and others with

average incomes of more than $900,000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We will have an alternative to the Bush tax cut plan &#150; one that gives tax

relief to working families rather than cuts for the very wealthy.  And we must

make the investments in our kids, in health care, in our nation&#146;s seniors.  The

Bush plan, however, is like Robin Hood in reverse,&#148; added Wellstone.
