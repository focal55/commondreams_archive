- November 13 - Payday lenders, thwarted by state regulators and the courts, are expanding 

        their use of partnerships with banks to make loans that violate state 

        usury laws, small loan rate caps, and even payday loan state legislation. 

        Rent-a-bank payday lenders seek to benefit from bank privileges despite 

        warnings from federal regulators and enforcement actions by state Attorneys 

        General, according to a new report by Consumer Federation of America and 

        the U. S. Public Interest Research Group.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Big payday lenders 

        don't want to comply with state laws designed to limit their triple-digit 

        interest rates, so they are renting bank charters in a cynical attempt 

        to avoid state consumer protections,&quot; said Jean Ann Fox, Director 

        of Consumer Protection for CFA. &quot;Check cashers, pawnshops, and payday 

        lenders are attempting the biggest bank powers heist of all times.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a typical payday 

        loan, a consumer writes a personal check for $230 to borrow $200 for two 

        weeks (&quot;until payday&quot;). The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on 

        this loan is 390%. At the end of the two-week period, the consumer often 

        extends the loan by paying the $30 fee to carry it for two more weeks. 

        Consumers who cannot cover the deposited check are faced with bounced 

        check fees from both the lender and the bank, added Ms. Fox.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Predatory triple-digit 

        payday loans threaten vulnerable consumers in this economic downturn,&quot; 

        said Edmund Mierzwinski, Consumer Program Director for U.S. PIRG. &quot;We 

        urge Congress and the states to ban predatory financial practices such 

        as holding checks as ransom for fast loans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new report, &quot;Rent-A-Bank 

        Payday Lending,&quot; surveys 235 payday lenders in 20 states and the 

        District of Columbia. It also analyses the status of payday lending laws 

        around the country and reports on the growing use of bank partnerships 

        by lenders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Key Survey Findings</b></font></p>

<ul>

        

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Payday lending 

          is now a booming business, with 65 million transactions being made by 

          up to 24,000 large and small payday loan outlets. The industry estimates 

          that up to 10 million American households will pay $2.4 billion in fees 

          this year for two-week loans.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nineteen states 

          and two territories have laws that do not authorize loans based on checks 

          at triple-digit interest, while 25 states and the District of Columbia 

          have authorized payday loans. Another six states have no cap on charges 

          for credit, permitting payday lending without any state law limits on 

          fees or loan terms. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national average 

          APR for surveyed loans was 470%, with an average fee of $18.28 to borrow 

          $100 for two weeks. APRs quoted ranged from 182% to 910% and fees ranged 

          from $10 to $35 per $100 borrowed.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is obvious 

        that competition and state limits are failing to protect payday loan borrowers,&quot; 

        Ed Mierzwinski said. &quot;Over half the surveyed lenders in states that 

        cap rates are charging at or above the legal maximum.&quot;</font></p>

<ul>

        

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most common 

          APR found was 390%, charged by 30% of all stores, followed by 520% charged 

          by 18% of all stores. Another 21% of stores charged APRs clustered between 

          442-459%. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers have 

          a hard time shopping for payday loans by price, since only 32% of lenders 

          disclosed a nominally accurate Annual Percentage Rate on charts or brochures 

          in their stores. Only 22% of stores disclosed both fees and APRs in 

          their stores. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over three quarters 

          of surveyed stores allow a consumer to renew or rollover unpaid loans, 

          either by paying the finance charge to extend the loan or accepting 

          a new check for another loan as soon as the old check was redeemed for 

          cash.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>State Legislative 

        Status</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report summarizes 

        state legislative activity in 2000 and 2001. States are showing greater 

        reluctance to authorize payday loans with North Carolina allowing its 

        payday loan law to sunset in August. Other states that refused to pass 

        industry-friendly authorizing legislation this year include Alabama, Virginia, 

        Maryland, Oklahoma, New York, Georgia, Texas, and California. Only Florida 

        and North Dakota legalized payday lending in 2001. In the last two years, 

        Maryland and Colorado adopted anti-broker or loan arranger laws in order 

        to keep control over local companies that broker loans for out of state 

        banks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rent-a-Bank Payday 

        Lending</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pawn shops, check 

        cashers and payday lenders are attempting to claim the rights of banks 

        to charge rates permitted in the bank's home state. Despite warnings from 

        federal bank regulators, bank involvement in payday lending is growing 

        both in states that retain usury limits, such as Virginia and Indiana, 

        and in states that authorize payday lending such as Colorado and California. 

        Lenders that partner with banks usually charge higher rates, make larger 

        loans, or make repeat loans in violation of state laws. Rent-a-bank payday 

        lenders are facing state enforcement or class action litigation in Colorado, 

        Ohio, Maryland, Florida and Texas. The report details bank and payday 

        loan connections (See attached chart.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Policy Recommendations 

        and Advice to Consumers</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups urged the 

        following reforms:</font></p>

<ul>

        

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">States should enforce 

          existing usury laws and small loan laws and enact anti-broker provisions 

          to keep state control over non-bank local companies. States that have 

          already adopted industry-friendly laws should amend their payday loan 

          laws to lower costs, prevent debt traps, and protect borrowers from 

          coercive collection tactics made possible by the holding of checks as 

          the basis for loans.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress and federal 

          bank regulators should stop rent-a-bank arrangements and outlaw the 

          holding of checks drawn on federally insured depository institutions 

          as the basis for small loans.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Banks, thrifts, 

          and credit unions should serve their account customers with fairly priced 

          overdraft protection and credit arrangements.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups urged consumers 

        in need of short-term cash to avoid extremely expensive payday loans, 

        and to instead, build up a savings next-egg to cover financial emergencies, 

        seek budgeting and debt management assistance from non-profit consumer 

        credit counseling services, and shop for credit based on both the dollar 

        finance charge and the Annual Percentage Rate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Consumers with 

        too much month at the end of the paycheck deserve better legal protection 

        against predatory lenders,&quot; Jean Ann Fox concluded. &quot;Lenders 

        who misuse bank charters and who devise tricks and ruses to evade state 

        consumer protections must be stopped.&quot;</font></p>
