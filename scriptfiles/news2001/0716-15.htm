- July 16 - Reacting to a decision by 

the Bush administration to reconsider provisions of an important 

Clean Water Act program, Earthjustice called today's action another 

example of the Bush team trying to use backdoor tactics to derail 

important environmental protections in the United States. The US 

Environmental Protection Agency's Total Maximum Daily Load program 

is designed to clean up the nation's most polluted waters and 

thereby constitutes one of the most crucial aspects of the Clean 

Water Act. In court filings by the federal government in the U.S. 

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the Bush 

administration asked the court to stay for 18 months pending 

litigation addressing a Clinton administration revision of the TMDL 

regulations. Such a move would allow the Bush administration time 

to reconsider -- and weaken -- the regulations, conservationists 

charge. Earthjustice attorneys Mike Lozeau and Howard Fox are 

representing environmental groups in the litigation over the TMDL 

regulations adopted in June 2000. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today, the Bush administration is setting in motion a process 

designed not only to delay but also to weaken the TMDL program -- 

the Clean Water Act's primary tool for cleaning up polluted lakes, 

beaches, rivers, and streams,&quot; said Mike Lozeau, staff attorney in 

Earthjustice's Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford Law School. 

&quot;The Bush administration has now aimed an arrow at the heart of one 

of the Clean Water Act's most important provisions.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Designed to serve as a pollution cap sufficient to make waters 

safe for fishing, swimming, and other uses, a TMDL represents the 

maximum amount of a pollutant that a body of water can receive and 

still meet water quality standards. Currently there are more than 

20,000 polluted bodies of water that have been identified by 

states, including 300,000 miles of river and shoreline and five 

million acres of lakes. More than 210 million Americans live 

within ten miles of polluted waters needing a TMDL clean up plan. 

TMDLs for these impaired waters are already decades overdue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The only thing dirtier than our nation's polluted waters is the 

Bush administration's backdoor attempt to weaken the Clean Water 

Act,&quot; said Howard Fox, Earthjustice managing attorney in 

Washington, D.C. &quot;This is another example of the Bush 

administration's approach of rolling back our environmental and 

public health protections.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's move is the Clean Water Act equivalent of what the Bush 

administration did on arsenic in drinking water and the roadless 

areas in national forests,&quot; said Fox. </font></p>
