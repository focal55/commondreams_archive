<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - October 18 - As 'Fast Track' legislation moves

towards a floor vote in the House of Representatives,

activists and organizers in the Green Party of the

United States have urged Congress to defeat the bill.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We encourage Americans who care about democracy and

about labor and environmental protections to call

their representatives in Congress, and tell them to

say no to HR 3500," said J. Roy Cannon of the Delaware

Green Party.  "Fast Track can and will be used to

nullify labor and environmental protections and to

bypass Congress and public scrutiny in deference to

powerful corporate interests."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Fast Track would also damage our constitutional

balance of power, because it would sweep away the

Senate's 'advise and consent' role in the negotiation

of treaties with foreign powers."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Working Americans have repeatedly told their

representatives, year after year, not to approve Fast

Track legislation," said Ben Manski, member of the

national Green Party's steering committee and a

Wisconsin Green.  "Each and every member of Congress

must know that if they betray their constituents by

voting for Fast Track now, the Green Party will use

those votes in the 2002 elections."  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">House Ways and Means Committee Chair Bill Thomas

(Republican - CA) and U.S. Trade Representative Robert

Zoellick, who call Fast Track a bipartisan effort to

jumpstart the economy and claim that support for Fast

Track is a test of patriotism, are pushing for a fast

vote in order to avoid public debate on a bill that

will determine trade policy for the next decade.  Fast

Track gives the president 'Trade Promotion Authority'

-- the extraordinary power to negotiate and accelerate

trade deals without amendment by Congress.  



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens stand with the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club,

Friends of the Earth, and other unions and

environmental groups in opposing the bill.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Free trade agreements like NAFTA have exported

hundreds of thousands of jobs, and Fast Track will

make free trade pacts and authorities even more

secretive and anti-democratic," noted Manski.  "We

find it shameful that supporters of Fast Track are

exploiting the September 11 tragedy to ram HR 3500

through Congress.  Such behavior is contrary to the

interests of the American people and unpatriotic."



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Family farms and food safety will be among the first

casualties," added Anita Rios, national steering

committee member and Ohio Green.  "The U.S. has

already allowed pesticide residues on produce in

amounts that violate current standards -- because we

fear trade challenges under current free trade pacts. 

Fast Track will give the President even more power to

nullify such protections."





</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">==> PLEASE NOTE: The Green Party of the United States

is the only Green political organization organized

nationally as a party, in which at least 31 states are

represented (and other states' memberships pending). 

It organized the Green National Convention in Denver

in June, 2000, at which Ralph Nader was nominated to

run for President, and is recognized among Green

Parties around the world.  The Green Party of the

United States is now in the process of filing papers

with the FEC for recognition as a national party.

of the Green Party should be directed solely to the

Green Party of the United States, through its media

representatives as listed in the heading above.  To
