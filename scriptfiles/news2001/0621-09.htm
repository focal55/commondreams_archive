One Year Later, Discrimination Still Outrages Americans</font></div>

- June 21 - In the year since the United States Supreme Court allowed the Boy 

Scouts of America to ban gay members, America is responding with 

unprecedented outrage against gay discrimination. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We've never seen this kind of opposition to anti-gay 

discrimination from such a diverse array of people,&quot; said Lambda 

Executive Director Kevin M. Cathcart. &quot;Parents, religious groups, 

corporations, cities, and schools agree: the Boy Scouts may have a 

legal right to discriminate, but that doesn't make discrimination 

right.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One year ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Boy Scouts of America v. 

Dale against Lambda's argument on behalf of James Dale. An exemplary 

Eagle Scout, Dale was kicked out of Scouting after BSA learned he was 

gay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The public is sending the message that anti-gay discrimination is 

un-American and unhealthy for all kids,&quot; Cathcart said, pointing to 

charities that cut BSA financial support, parents who put their kids 

in youth groups that don't discriminate, and growing demands for 

reversal of BSA policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, BSA council presidents and board chairmen from New York, 

Los Angeles, Chicago, West Los Angeles, Orange County, Calif., San 

Francisco, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Boston urged BSA to change 

its policy so that &quot;membership and leadership positions are open to 

persons regardless of their sexual orientation,&quot; at BSA's recent 

national meeting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also rejecting the anti-gay policy are the American Medical 

Association, and many school systems, religious organizations, 

corporations, United Way chapters, and individual scouts and troops. 

For example: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The American Medical Association adopted a resolution stating 

that youth groups should lift bans on membership for gay youth 

because these bans contribute to anxiety and depression among gay 

youth and are bad public health policy; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Fimmaker Steven Spielberg stepped down from an advisory board 

of the BSA, saying he is &quot;deeply saddened&quot; by BSA's policy, adding, 

&quot;It's a real shame;&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Seven Cub Scout packs in Oak Park, Ill., were expelled from 

Scouting for refusing to discriminate; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Public schools in cities ranging from Chicago, Minneapolis, San 

Diego, and New York City to Chapel Hill, N.C., and Framingham, Mass., 

have taken action including eliminating the Boy Scouts' special 

privilege to distribute literature in schools and ending sponsorship 

of BSA troops; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism called on 

Jewish families and synagogues to sever ties with BSA; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contact Lambda for a fuller list. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Lambda Senior Staff Attorney David Buckel, who worked on the 

Dale case, &quot;The Scouts' discriminatory policy tells gay youth that 

they are unworthy, that there is something wrong with them. 

Thankfully, people across the country are countering that damage and 

helping these young people stand up with pride.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lambda is the oldest and largest legal organization dedicated to 

the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, and people with HIV and AIDS. 

In addition to its headquarters, Lambda has regional offices in Los 

Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta and will open an office in Dallas in 

2002. </font></p>
