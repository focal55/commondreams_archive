- February 28 - The non-profit Clean Air

Trust today welcomed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator

Christine Todd Whitman's decision to move forward with a plan to

clean up big diesel trucks and buses and diesel fuel.

<p>"Every American will breathe easier because of this decision,"

noted Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Trust. "It will

mean fewer asthma attacks in children, fewer cases of chronic

bronchitis and other breathing problems, and fewer people dying

prematurely."

<p>O'Donnell noted that the EPA itself has calculated that the

diesel cleanup would prevent more than 8,000 premature deaths and

360,000 asthma attacks each year. The diesel cleanup would produce

the clean-air equivalent of removing 13 million of today's trucks

off the road.

<p>The EPA plan was announced by former Administrator Carol Browner

last December. It would reduce pollution by new big diesel trucks

and buses by up to 95 percent by 2007. To enable use of high-tech

pollution control devices, EPA also would require refiners to

remove 97 percent of the sulfur from highway diesel fuel. Sulfur

is a poison, much as lead was a poison to automobile catalytic

converters.

<p>The cleanup plan had been thrown into doubt on Jan. 20, when

White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card ordered federal agencies to

review recent major rules, including the diesel cleanup. New EPA

Administrator Whitman reviewed the rule closely and agreed that it

is needed to protect public health and that it can be achieved at

a reasonable cost.

<p>O'Donnell noted that yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld

EPA's national health standards for fine particle soot, a pollutant

linked to tens of thousands of premature deaths annually as well as

other breathing problems.

<p>"Diesel trucks and buses are major sources of fine particle

soot," O'Donnell noted. "The Supreme Court ruling underscored the

urgent need to clean up this dangerous pollution."

<p>O'Donnell noted that petroleum refiners have sued to block the

diesel cleanup. He said health and environmental groups hope that

the EPA and Justice Department will "vigorously defend" the new

standards in court. He added that health and environmental groups

would soon announce they intend to intervene in court on EPA's

behalf.
