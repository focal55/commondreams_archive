- June 27 - &quot;This weekend NOW is releasing its second Watch Out, Listen Up! report on

primetime programming,&quot; said NOW President Patricia Ireland.  &quot;NOW's feminist

analysts watched hours of TV&#151;much of it degrading, violent and bearing little

resemblance to the lives of real women.  But several shows did stand out for

their ability to portray women and girls as complex, well-rounded people.&quot; 

Ireland will be at the National NOW Conference in Philadelphia, PA., June

29-July 1, where one of the many issues on the agenda is media reform and

activism.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of NOW's Watch Out, Listen Up! campaign is to work toward a

positive and broadly inclusive portrayal of women in the media.  NOW evaluated

programming based on gender composition and diversity, violent content, sexual

exploitation and social responsibility.  In addition to the four major

networks, NOW added UPN and The WB to this year's report. <br>

        <br>

<b>What:</b>           Release of Watch Out, Listen Up! TV Analysis Report</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>When:</b>           Friday, June 29, 1:00 pm<br>

                &quot;On the Verge: Women and Media&quot; workshop</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Where:          </b>Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel<br>

                Philadelphia, PA<br>

                and online at <a href="http://www.now.org/issues/media/watchout2" target="new">www.now.org/issues/media/watchout2</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year's report inspired lots of positive response from TV viewers asking

what they could do next.  &quot;Many women and men write to and call NOW to share

their outrage about what passes for entertainment on television,&quot; Ireland

said.  &quot;People are looking for a way to make the networks listen up and

respond

to their complaints&#151;they want to be part of something bigger.  NOW's media

activism campaign can make that happen.&quot;  <br>
