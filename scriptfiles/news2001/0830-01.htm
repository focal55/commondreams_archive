- August 30 - Today, a report issued 

by The Commonwealth Fund and written by Jeanne Lambrew of the 

George Washington University documents disparities that women 

face in accessing both health care and health insurance. It 

projects that the number of uninsured women will increase and 

the unique challenges they face will only grow worse if current 

trends continue. Following a review of selected insurance 

coverage expansion approaches, the report concludes that 

building on insurance options that currently exist -- 

employer-sponsored insurance and programs like the Children's 

Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicaid -- offer the most 

targeted and potentially effective approaches to increase access 

to affordable coverage for the nation's 15 million uninsured 

women. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commenting on the new report, Karen Davis, president of The 

Commonwealth Fund said: &quot;In the aftermath of recent reports 

about insurance premium increases and a sagging economy, concern 

is rising about the difficulty of obtaining and maintaining 

affordable health insurance. The study being released today 

clearly illustrates how women, who are more likely to be caring 

for children or aging parents, are less likely than men to have 

good access to health care themselves.&quot; While women's higher 

rate of poverty and greater eligibility for Medicaid have 

translated into slightly fewer women than men being uninsured, 

this longstanding insurance coverage pattern is changing. In 

fact, should coverage trends continue, the number of uninsured 

women may actually surpass the number of uninsured men in less 

than five years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Key findings of the report, &quot;Diagnosing Disparities in Health 

Insurance for Women: A Prescription for Change&quot; include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Overall, women need and use more health care services than 

men. More women than men have chronic illnesses and report fair 

or poor health. They are more likely to use services like mental 

health care and, as they age, prescription drugs. Over 80 

percent of women ages 50 to 70 rely regularly on prescription 

drugs, compared with 71 percent of men in that age group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Uninsured women are nearly 20 percent more likely to have 

difficulty obtaining health care services than uninsured men. 

Moreover, among Americans ages 50 to 64, women are nearly twice 

as likely as men to have trouble accessing care. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The number of uninsured women has grown three times faster 

than the number of uninsured men over the past five years. If 

this pace continues, the number of uninsured women will exceed 

the number of uninsured men for the first time in 2005. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Uninsured women are more likely than uninsured men to be 

married, and the disparity is even greater for older women. 

Among the uninsured, about 49 percent of women are married, 

compared with 40 percent of men. Lower-income married women are 

often ineligible for Medicaid even though their children may be 

enrolled in (or eligible for) Medicaid or CHIP. Older married 

women (ages 55 to 65) are nearly 40 percent more likely to be 

uninsured than older married men, in part because their husbands 

meet Medicare's age 65 and over coverage requirement and they do 

not. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Low-income mothers represent three of five low-income 

uninsured parents. In addition, they account for one-quarter of 

all uninsured women. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Women ages 55 to 65 are over 20 percent more likely to be 

uninsured than men. As the baby boom generation turns 55 

beginning this year, the number of uninsured women in this age 

group will likely increase by at least 50 percent. Over 

one-fifth of women over age 50 with a retired, older husband are 

uninsured. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Women are a third more likely to turn down employer-based 

insurance and become uninsured, often because of cost. About 20 

percent of uninsured women have the option of employer-based 

insurance but do not participate, compared with 15 percent of 

men. Not surprisingly, three of five of these women are 

low-income and probably cannot afford the premium, 

notwithstanding the fact that women tend to need health care and 

health insurance more than men. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Women who work in small firms are somewhat less likely 

than men to be offered health insurance. Fewer women than men 

work in small businesses, but fewer women who work in small 

business are given the option of job-based health insurance (44 

versus 47 percent). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- About 80 percent of uninsured women live in states that 

allow insurers of individual (versus group) insurance policies 

to deny coverage to applicants. In addition, about 75 percent of 

uninsured women live in states without constraints on the 

premiums that can be charged. Moreover, women may not get the 

benefits that they need, since individual insurance policies 

typically exclude or increase premiums for services like 

maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health coverage. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study also examines the impact of different approaches to 

expanding coverage to women. Findings include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Building on Medicaid and CHIP could rapidly and 

efficiently cover one-fourth of uninsured women. Providing 

additional federal financing to states to cover low-income 

parents would disproportionately benefit women and their 

children. It also would be relatively easy to accomplish since 

these parents' children are already eligible for or enrolled in 

these programs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Providing direct premium assistance to women workers 

through Medicaid and CHIP or other public programs to help 

purchase employer-sponsored insurance is likely to be more 

effective than subsidies administered through the tax code. 

Since Medicaid and CHIP provide greater and more targeted 

subsidies, innovative state partnerships with private employers 

and insurers are more likely to most effectively and efficiently 

target and enroll low-income women in employer-provided plans. 

Such approaches, however, need to ensure continuing employer 

financial participation and meaningful benefits to truly benefit 

women. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Encouraging more employers to offer more employees health 

insurance through tax incentives could help the majority of 

uninsured women who lack access to job-based health coverage 

today. Tax incentives for employer-based coverage (e.g., tax 

credits for individuals purchasing coverage through small 

business purchasing coalitions; tax incentives for employers to 

encourage coverage of part-time workers) have potential to help 

uninsured working women -- particularly those employed part-time 

or by small firms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Expanding the individual insurance market through tax 

credits is likely to be less effective in reaching uninsured 

women, especially low-income or older women. Since individual 

health insurance can be expensive for women in their 

childbearing years, or for women with a history of health 

problems, or for older women, it may not be an affordable 

option, even with a tax credit. In addition, lack of insurance 

protections, such as guaranteed issue and premium rating 

reforms, may make such an approach viable for only the 

healthiest uninsured women. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Creating new insurance options for the near elderly, such 

as a Medicare buy-in, would help the growing number of uninsured 

women ages 55 to 65. Women in this age group are less likely to 

have access to employer-based insurance and are more likely to 

have trouble accessing or affording individual health insurance. 

Many of these women are married to retired men, some of whom are 

covered by Medicare. Extending the eligibility of public 

programs like Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits 

Program to people ages 55 to 65 or at least to spouses of 

Medicare beneficiaries could provide an affordable alternative 

that disproportionately benefits women, who are more likely than 

men to be uninsured at this age. </font></p>
