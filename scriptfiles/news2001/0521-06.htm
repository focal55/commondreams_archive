- May 21 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Board of Directors today named prominent gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) movement leader Lorri L. Jean as executive director. Jean, the former executive director of the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center, will begin work in early June. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;I am honored to have been selected as the new executive director of NGLTF,&#148; Jean said, &#147;and I have long admired its work on behalf of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender movement. I am especially proud to be joining the staff at this pivotal political moment when an unapologetic and inclusive approach to our community's rights is of such great importance.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;What our movement needs now more than ever is NGLTF&#146;s strong and progressive leadership. I&#146;m ecstatic that Lorri Jean has enthusiastically accepted the challenge,&#148; said Rachel Rosen, co-chair of the NGLTF Board of Directors. &#147;Lorri represents the best of our movement: a proven track record of building local communities, a strong commitment to progressive political work, and a demonstrated history of building nonprofit financial strength and stability.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;NGLTF and the entire LGBT community is unbelievably fortunate to have someone like Lorri Jean lead us at this time,&#148; said Phill Wilson, founder of the Black Gay and Lesbian Leadership Forum and currently founding director of the African American AIDS Policy and Treatment Institute. &#147;There are very few people in our community that bring this level of experience, vision and commitment to progressive change. Lorri embodies the best we have to offer. I'm looking forward to working with her and the Task Force.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean, a dynamic leader with proven fundraising skills, has a long history of accomplishments. As a community leader in Los Angeles, she has received numerous honors and awards. Among her major accomplishments are: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Jean led the L.A. Center through a period of unprecedented expansion, dramatically increasing the number of clients and volunteers, the diversity and volume of services, the number of staff, and the size of the budget to make the Center the largest GLBT organization in the world. Under her leadership, the Center&#146;s annual budget grew from $8 million to $32 million, and private donor giving grew from $1 million to more than $9 million annually. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under her leadership, the Center launched Lambda Medical Group, the first-of-its-kind HMO/managed care practice; opened three state-of-the-art medical facilities; purchased, funded, and renovated a $7 million facility; and created the Center&#146;s first endowment fund of $10 million. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While at the L.A. Center, Jean co-founded the National Association of LGBT Community Centers, a coalition of centers serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. The coalition meets annually at NGLTF Foundation&#146;s Creating Change conference. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean served at the president of Washington, D.C.&#146;s Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance from 1986-1988. She was the lead plaintiff in the landmark successful lawsuit against Georgetown University charging sexual orientation-based discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prior to taking on her role at the L.A. Center, Jean was the Deputy Regional Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in San Francisco, where she oversaw the disaster response and recovery operations of FEMA&#146;s largest region. Previously, she was the Associate General Counsel at FEMA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most recently, Jean was the co-founder and chief operating officer of a Los Angeles-based advertising company serving the e-commerce industry. She holds a J.D. from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. and B.S. in Communication from Arizona State University. She and her partner of nine years, attorney Gina M. Calvelli, live in Los Angeles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society.</i> </font></p>
