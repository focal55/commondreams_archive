- November 7 - The Green Party posted major gains

in yesterdays municipal elections, taking two seats in

Minneapolis, Minnesota and New Haven, Connecticut and

reaching the 110 officeholder count for the first

time.  The Green Party has shown consistent gains in

the number of officeholders in recent years.  Over 250

Green candidates have competed in 2001.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens report at least 26 victories yesterday,

bringing their total for the year to a record high 42,

including spring races.  This is the best election

result ever for the Green Party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These victories demonstrate the strong momentum of

the Green Party since the 2000 elections,&quot; said Dean

Myerson, Green Party Political Coordinator.  &quot;We have

the message that Americans want to hear and, once

elected, our people roll up their sleeves and work for

their constituents.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Natalie Johnson Lee and Dean Zimmerman won seats on

the Minneapolis City Council and the party barely

missed winning another.  Minneapolis (population about

383,000) now becomes the second largest U.S. city to

elect a Green to the city council.  San Francisco

(775,000) is the largest, with Green County Supervisor

Matt Gonzales.  In Minneapolis, Annie Young was also

re-elected to the Parks &amp; Recreation Board for a

fourth term.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Hartford, incumbent Elizabeth Horton Sheff was

re-elected to the City Council. In New Haven, John

Halle was re-elected to the Board of Alderman and

joined by newcomer Joyce Chen to make New Haven the

ninth U.S. city to have at least two Greens on the

City Council.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greens are winning more election because we are

running the best candidates in these races,&quot; said Mike

Feinstein, Mayor of Santa Monica and tracker of Green

campaigns and election news.  &quot;We continue to win more

races and have more officeholders because we run

serious and credible candidates who speak to the

issues that people care about, like sustainable

communities, universal health care, and earning a

living wage.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party also expects to receive National

Committee status from the Federal Election Commission

tomorrow (Thursday, November 8), further establishing

the Green Party's presence as the genuine alternative

to politics as usual and America's third largest

political party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party will post further election results as

they are confirmed.</font></p>
