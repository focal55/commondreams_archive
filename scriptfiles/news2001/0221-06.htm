- February 21 - Public Citizen is urging Dr. Bernard

Schwetz, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to deny all

pending applications to &quot;treat&quot; food with ionizing radiation until new and

up-to-date toxicology tests on irradiated food are performed. In legalizing irradiation,

the FDA relied on tests from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

<p>Conducting modern tests is critical, because among the pending applications is a

request from the food industry to irradiate ready-to-eat foods, which comprise more than

one-third of the typical American&#146;s diet. </p>



<p>Since 1983, the FDA has legalized the irradiation of numerous classes of food,

including beef, poultry, pork, lamb, fruit, vegetables, eggs, juice and spices <font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> at the equivalent radiation dose ranging from 33 million to 1

billion chest X-rays. Although it has given the go-ahead for foods that comprise about

half of the U.S. food supply to be irradiated, the FDA has failed to determine a level of

radiation to which food can be exposed and still be safe for human consumption, according

to Public Citizen research detailed in <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/rad-food/brokenrecord/brokenrecord.PDF">the recent

report, <i>A Broken Record</i></a>. </p>



<p>Additionally, the FDA has relied on decades-old tests that do not meet current

scientific protocols designed to determine whether irradiated food could be toxic, or

cause mutations or reproductive problems in the people who eat it. </p>



<p>The FDA has dismissed a vast body of scientific evidence suggesting that irradiated

food may not be safe to eat. Dozens of experiments conducted since the 1950s have revealed

a variety of health problems in animals<b> </b>that have consumed irradiated food,

including premature death, a rare form of cancer, fatal internal bleeding, chromosome

aberrations, stillbirths, nutritional deficiencies and liver damage. Additionally,

irradiation cannot kill the pathogen that causes &quot;mad cow&quot; disease, according to

the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>In a <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/rad-food/LetterDrSchwetz.htm">letter<b> </b>to

Schwetz</a>, Public Citizen urged the FDA to deny the ready-to-eat food application, as

well as requests from the food industry to irradiate crustaceans (such as shrimp, lobsters

and crabs) and mollusks (such as oysters, clams, scallops, mussels, octopus and squid). </p>



<p>&quot;The very integrity of our food supply is at stake, as are the health and

well-being of the American people,&quot; said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;The FDA&#146;s record

on food irradiation is a national embarrassment. The time to go back to the drawing board

is now.&quot;
