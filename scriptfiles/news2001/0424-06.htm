<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- April 24 - Read Statement by the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 850 U.S. religious leaders from across the theological spectrum have signed a petition urging Congress and President George W. Bush to reject any &quot;faith-based&quot; funding plans that do not protect Americans against religious discrimination or jeopardize the independence of houses of worship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petition, unveiled today, expresses the religious leaders' concerns that the so-called &quot;charitable choice&quot; provisions of the initiative will foster excessive entanglement between religion and government. While the religious leaders affirm the role of faith as a source of healing in society, they oppose publicly funded religious discrimination and any government initiative that pits faith groups against one another in seeking limited public funds. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These provisions would entangle religion and government in an unprecedented and perilous way,&quot; the petition asserts. &quot;The flow of government dollars and the accountability for how those funds are used will inevitably undermine the independence and integrity of houses of worship. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Allowing government officials to pick and choose among religions for limited government funds will foster an unhealthy competition between religions and could lead to an insidious form of political abuse,&quot; the petition continues. &quot;Exempting government-funded religious institutions from employment laws banning discrimination on the basis of religion weakens our nation's civil rights protections for those seeking to provide assistance to those in need.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petition drive was coordinated by the Coalition Against Religious Discrimination (CARD), an alliance of religious, public policy and professional organizations that have concerns about Bush's &quot;faith-based&quot; initiative. The appeal is being sent to President Bush and members of Congress. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petition is being released the same day the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution holds a hearing on &quot;charitable choice&quot; funding and one day before U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts' invitation-only Republican summit for clergy on &quot;faith-based&quot; funding proposals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of CARD say that government funds should go to religious groups only if there are safeguards in place to ensure church-state separation and forbid any forms of discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asserts the petition, &quot;For decades many houses of worship have set up separate religiously affiliated institutions to perform government-funded social services, a system that has protected both the autonomy of houses of worship and the integrity of government programs. Partnerships between religion and government must be undertaken with great caution so as not to undermine the very integrity and freedom that allows both the followers and the institutions of religion to practice and keep faith in our nation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush has called for allowing religious groups to receive tax aid and still run pervasively religious programs. CARD members say this plan will lead to government-funded religion and taxpayer-supported religious discrimination. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CARD will continue to accept signatures on the petition as Congress debates the Bush &quot;faith-based&quot; plan. </font></p>
