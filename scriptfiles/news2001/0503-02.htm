- May 3 - Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney responded to President

Bush's first 100 days in office.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush introduced America to the idea of compassionate

conservatism, and indeed Bush has demonstrated a high level of compassion.

Unfortunately, his compassion has been reserved for the moneyed interests

who filled his political coffers and helped to secure his theft of the

Presidency.  Afterall, special interest groups contributed an unprecedented

amount of campaign contributions, and now the chickens have come home to

roost,&quot; McKinney said.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. McKinney compiled a list of 80 failures that the Bush Administration has

produced in his first 100 days.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bush calls himself a 'Reformer with results'.  But he only seems bent on

reforming laws that were intended to protect America's families, America's

workers, and America's environment.  The results have been a boon for

corporate interests, and devastating for the American people,&quot; McKinney

concluded.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

1.	Bush campaigned on a pledge to provide a $1.6 trillion tax cut to

America's wealthiest families.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.	Bush named the wealthiest cabinet in the history of the United

States.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.	Bush's Cabinet stumped for the President's tax cut proposal.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.	Bush's number one priority in his first 100 days has been promoting

a tax plan that will cost $2. 6 trillion over the next ten years.  45% of

his cut will benefit the wealthiest one- percent of taxpayers, people with

an average income of $915,000.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5.	The Bush tax plan against women and lower income earners gives no

tax relief at all to those families too poor to pay income taxes (12 million

families with 24 million children), no tax deductions for 53% of Black and

Hispanic families; and no tax cuts made for single persons earning between

$6,001 to $27,050 nor for married persons earning $12,001 to $45,200.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6.	The administration's proposal also fails to make adjustments that

would make tax rates truly progressive. Completely untouched is the

regressive payroll tax that places the heaviest burden on low to middle

income workers, predominately female, while leaving in place a substantial

break for high income earners who make no payroll tax contributions above

the $80,400 level (most of whom are men, of course).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7.	Bush' tax cut would wipe out the rest of any funds available,

leaving nothing for future contingencies, including shoring up Social

Security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8.	The richest cabinet in history will get a kickback of over $100

million through Bush's efforts to push the Estate Tax legislation through

Congress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9.	The Republican party is so devoid of talent that Bush named a record

number of George Herbert Walker retreads to his Administration.  There's no

question about one assignment that's going to get a big, fat &quot;Incomplete&quot;

--installing the 487 top officials who will run the executive branch the

next four years.  90% of assigned positions are unfilled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10.	Our new Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, recently campaigned on

eliminating the Department of Energy, the very program he now runs, while

also leading efforts to prevent increased fuel efficiency in vehicles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">11.	Our Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, has led efforts to

rollback endangered species protection and allowed mining company polluters

to escape clean up requirements and liability.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">12.	Bush appoints Gale Norton as Secretary of Interior because she

believes that corporations have a constitutional right to pollute.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">13.	Gale Norton's first concrete attempt at a regulatory rollback was a

proposal to gut updated environmental mining regulations that went into

effect at the end of the Clinton administration.  Independent reports

estimate that taxpayers could be on the hook for about $1 billion in

environmental cleanup costs from today's mines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">14.	President Bush's choice for the No. 3 spot at the Department of

Energy is Robert G. Card, who until recently was CEO and president of a

nuclear cleanup contractor that has been fined or penalized more than

$725,000 for numerous worker safety, procurement and other violations since

1996.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">15.	The New Attorney General has a history of blocking enforcement of

environmental laws; and throughout his career, Ashcroft has worked

tirelessly to restrict a woman's right to choose. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">16.	The new head of the EPA, Christine Whitman, who doubts that global

warming is a serious problem, defended global warming and got kicked by

Bush.  In a memo from Whitman to Bush, the EPA Administrator stressed the

need for Bush to &quot;appear&quot; to be engaged in addressing global warming, as if

the environment responds to appearances.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">17.	Tommy Thompson, the new Secretary of the Department Of Health And

Human Services was one of the country's most anti-choice governors and now

heads up the department that wields the greatest influence over policies

affecting women's reproductive health.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">18.	Bush named Don Eberly, a right wing activist who was an official

with the National Fatherhood Institute, to head up a White House office for

faith-based programs. Some women's rights advocates are concerned that

Eberly will utilize the office to help funnel even more federal monies to

misogynist groups who promote so-called fatherhood initiatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">19.	John Negroponte, Bush's appointee for UN Ambassador has a track

record of disrespecting human rights.  During his tour as ambassador to

Honduras, Negroponte earned his reputation for being soft on human rights

abuses. Under the helm of General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, Honduras's

military government was both a close ally of the Reagan administration and

was disappearing dozens of political opponents in classic death squad

fashion.  Negroponte turned a blind eye to human rights abuses and even

helped to cover up extrajudicial killings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">20.	Bush's appointee for Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and

International Security, John Bolton, does not belong in the arms control job

because, as the director of the Carnegie Non-Proliferation Project, Joseph

Cirincione, says: &quot;Bolton is philosophically opposed to most of the

international treaties that comprise the nonproliferation regime.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">21.	The nomination of Cuban-born Otto J. Reich as the State Department's

top Latin America official is drawing Democratic criticism based on his role

in the 1980s Central American wars.  The Democrats' concerns over Reich

focus on his leadership of the State Department's one-time Office of Public

Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean. The office - which Reich led

from its inception in June 1983 until January 1986 - was accused of running

an illegal, covert domestic propaganda effort against Nicaragua's leftist

Sandinista government and in favor of the Contra rebels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">22.	Bush named Linda Fisher, an executive with Monsanto Co., a leading

developer of the world's most dangerous chemicals and biotech foods, for the

second-ranking job at the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House

said yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">23.	Energy interests gave $2.9 million to Bush for his political

campaign, and then kicked in an additional $2.2 million for his inauguration

fund. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">24.	Bush plans to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

and to sell out our public lands to private interests</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">25.	He did a big favor for major electricity wholesalers by keeping the

federal government largely out of the California energy crisis, which has

produced major profits for energy companies including Dynegy Inc., Enron

Corp. and Reliant Energy Inc., all of which are based in Bush's home state

of Texas. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">26.	Bush showed his loyalty to the coal mining and electricity

industries when he reversed a campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide

emissions, which may have saved an estimated 30,000 lives a year of those

who die due to respiratory illness. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">27.	Bush endangered the world's future and damaged our credibility in

the International community when he announced the United States' withdrawal

from the Kyoto Protocol; an international treaty aimed at combating global

warming.  Seems that he's more interested in changing the global climate

than the political climate.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">28.	Dick Cheney formulated crucial energy policy decisions behind closed

doors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">29.	Cheney's task force focused heavily on incentives for production;

easing regulatory barriers for energy development; and opening more public

lands to drilling including national monuments and the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">30.	Americans, by a remarkable 7-to-1 margin, think that Bush is less

concerned about protecting the environment than about protecting the

interests of the energy industry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">31.	Despite objections from his brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he

plans on auctioning offshore oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.

Seems that natural gas is thicker then blood.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">32.	The Bush administration announced that it will block a rule from

Clinton's administration requiring more energy efficient air conditioners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">33.	Republican representative Sherwood Boehlert said that the Bush first

100 days deserve the grade of &quot;incomplete in dealing with the environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">34.	Bush's budget proposes slashing more than $200 million from federal

renewable energy and efficiency research programs, even as his

administration declares the United States needs to find ways to cope with an

&quot;energy crisis.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">35.	The snows of Mount Kilimanjaro melt away as global temperatures and

ocean levels rise, Bush plans nothing to address it.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">36.	The Environmental Protection Agency announced it would withdraw the

pending decrease in allowable arsenic for drinking water, prepared during

the final days of the Clinton administration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">37.	Bush asked Congress to remove from the Endangered Species Act a

provision that allows environmental groups and others to sue the Interior

Department to get rare plants and animals listed as endangered.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">38.	The Bush Administration plans to suspend rules that require federal

contractors to comply with environmental, civil rights and labor laws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">39.	In Quebec, Bush announced his intention to promote a trade plan for

the Americas based on the failed NAFTA model.  This will lead to further

erosion of labor rights, human rights, and environmental protections

throughout the hemisphere.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">40.	And Bush is looking to kill the roadless policy rule that will

protect millions of acres of public land from taxpayer subsidized logging. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">41.	A Bush White House aide confirms that Bush is taking a look at

recommending easing clean air regulations without Congressional actions,

thus saving utilities and coal-mining companies billions of dollars of

violations of clean air regulations and at the same time mooting legal

action against polluting companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">42.	Bush was the top recipient of contributions from tobacco companies.

Through carefully orchestrated budget cuts, Bush has managed to kill the

lawsuit that the Justice Department has against big tobacco for deliberately

deceiving the American people on public health issues.  This move could

potentially save big tobacco billions.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">43.	Speaking of Bankrupt public policy.  Legislation championed for

years by the financial industry that would make it harder for consumers to

wipe away their debts was passed by an overwhelming margin in both chambers

of Congress. Though a similar measure had been approved last year, President

Clinton vetoed it. Bush, however, has signaled he will sign the bill, a move

that could generate an estimated tens of millions of dollars in additional

revenue for major credit card companies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">44.	Where did Bush's enthusiasm come from?  Charles Cawley, President of

MBNA America personally raised at least $100,000 for the Bush campaign,

qualifying him for admission into the Pioneers, the campaign's roster of top

supporters.  Last January, Cawley broke out his checkbook again, writing a

$100,000 check to the Bush-Cheney Inaugural Fund.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">45.	The US Chamber of Commerce contributed more than $514, 000 to

candidates and parties, 94% of that money went to Republicans, and the

National Association of Manufacturers spent $12.8 million lobbying Members

of Congress from 1997 to 1999.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">46.	In a private meeting in late February, Bush and Republican

congressional leaders decided to kill the ergonomics rule put forth by the

Clinton Administration, which would protect workers from workplace related

injuries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">47.	Following his pledge to leave no [rich] child behind, President

Bush's budget reduces resources for the Child Care and Development Block

Grant projects by $ 200 million.  That means that many low-income children

will no longer be eligible for childcare, making it more difficult for their

parents to work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">48.	Bush plans to eliminate all funding for the Early Learning

Opportunities program, which would have supported parent education and

family support services.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">49.	Bush's budget will shortchange vital education programs; including

efforts to reduce class sizes, improve teacher training, repair crumbling

schools, promote after-school programs, and increase the number of Pell

Grants available to low income freshmen.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">50.	Bush plans to cut in half grants that help states investigate and

prevent child abuse and neglect.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">51.	President Bush has proposed a regime of annual testing for all

students between grades three and eight.  Schools that demonstrated an

improvement in performance would be granted increased federal funding.

Students at schools designated as low-performing would, after three years,

be able to use their share of federal funds to attend other public or

private schools. The school would then be privatized with the assistance of

the federal government.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">52.	Bush's budget does not even provide funds to keep up with inflation

for the WIC program, which provides vital nutrition assistance to low-income

women, infants, and children.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">53.	On the anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, President Bush ordered the

reinstatement of the global &quot;gag&quot; rule on international family planning

programs, programs that strive to prevent unintended pregnancies, reduce

abortion, and avert hundreds of thousands of infant and maternal deaths

worldwide each year.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">54.	Bush is prepared to unilaterally abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile

Treaty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">55.	Bush strongly advocates the National Missile Defense System or &quot;Star

Wars&quot;.  This program has cost taxpayers over $40 billion to date, and yet it

has failed repeatedly in carefully orchestrated tests.  The program is

destabilizing and China has already indicated that it would initiate an arms

race if the US pursues the program.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">56.	The Bush administration has put its European allies on notice that

it intends to move quickly to develop a missile defense and plans to abandon

or fundamentally alter the treaty that has been the keystone of arms control

for nearly 30 years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">57.	Bush said he would suspend negotiations with North Korea, this

strict stance on Korea has soured once-improving relations with North Korea.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">58.	The US bombs 10 miles outside of Baghdad- -a major metropolitan

area- -saying that the area was &quot;unpopulated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">59.	Plans by US President George W Bush to sell weapons including eight

diesel-powered submarines to Taiwan have received an embarrassing setback at

the hands of European governments. Neither the Germans nor the Dutch, who

have sown up the market in diesel submarines, are willing to allow the sale

of the subs to Taiwan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">60.	Under Bush, there has been a growing Anti-US feeling in the EU and

around the world.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">61.	Bush's decision to proceed with arms sales to TaiwanoChina has said

that offensive weapons such as subs will only lead to greater tensions in

Asia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">62.	Bush's commitment to the Balkans. While trying to build peace he is

reducing US commitment to peacebuilding. Same with the Middle East where

tensions are growing and he is seeking to be less involved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">63.	Bush has continued use of drug certification and the nomination of

another hard liner to lead the War on Drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">64.	President Bush worked with the CIA and a Private Military Company to

cover up their responsibility in the deaths of two American missionaries

killed by a Peruvian fighter as part of US drug war strategy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">65.	For women who depend upon government to advance economic equity in

an economically unjust society, there would be little or no money for

improved child care/early childhood education programs, effective Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission enforcement against discrimination and

harassment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">66.	There will be little or no money for expansion of Violence Against

Women programs, few options for expansion of health care coverage to the 43

million uncovered, no funds for a new prescription drug benefit for seniors.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">67.	A multi-trillion dollar tax cut may also jeopardize the future

financial solvency of Social Security and Medicare -- the majority of

beneficiaries being women -- and there will be few resources remaining for

critically needed social investments. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">68.	Bush proposes to privatize Social Security, a move that jeopardizes

the financial future of millions of Americans.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">69.	President Bush announced an expanded faith-based initiative and a

vigorous, but misguided campaign to turn over social service programs to

religious organizations. Faith-based initiatives, a more pernicious version

of the old &quot;charitable choice,&quot; would permit direct federal funding of

programs run by religious organizations, free to proselytize and

discriminate, that would have little public accountability.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">70.	Bush's faith based initiative faces major setback: people of faith

have little faith in it!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">71.	President Bush's budget will propose deep cuts in a variety of

health programs for people without health insurance.   Services providing

&quot;health care access for the uninsured,&quot; would be reduced 86 percent, to $20

million, from $140 million in the current fiscal year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">72.	Mr. Bush's budget request would also cut federal spending for the

training of doctors, dentists, nurses, pharmacists and other health

professionals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">73.	Bush put a stop to giving unions preference on contracts for federal

building projects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">74.	Senator Pete Domenici disagrees vehemently with Bush's decision to

hold all federal spending to no more than a 4% increase.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">75.	Kathy Harris, symbol of a purposely-failed election, travels to

Washington to testify before Congress on the need to have elections that the

people can believe in.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">76.	George W. Bush needs to win the Florida electoral college vote more

in 2004 than in 2000.  Therefore, don't look too soon for any election

reform from this President.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">77.	According to David Broder, &quot;The Bush White House so far has not made

changing the election system a priority.  The President's proposed budget,

along with the budget resolutions of the House and Senate, set aside no fund

for federal aid for improving election equipment or administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">78.	Republican Jim Ramstad said that Bush White House interference in

Minnesota politics could end up hurting the party.  A phone call by Dick

Cheney to dissuade a potential candidate from running has all the markings

of Bush and Cheney trying to be a &quot;kingmaker&quot; thwarting the will of the

people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">79.	World reaction was tepid, critical or simply silent to President

Bush's announcement that the United States would build a shield against

ballistic missile attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">80.	President Bush throws a bash featuring 535 Members of Congress to

celebrate his first 100 days and schedules it on a Monday when few Members

of Congress are in town: fewer than 200 Members of Congress bothered to show

up.</font></p>
