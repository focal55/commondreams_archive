<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - October 5 - Today the Leadership 

Conference on Civil Rights/Education Fund launched a new public 

service announcement (PSA) campaign spearheaded by Grammy 

award-winning artist Dave Matthews, calling on viewers during this 

time of tragedy to reflect on the promise of America: that people 

who trace their heritage to every nation on Earth can live together 

with mutual respect and understanding. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Entitled &quot;We are ALL Americans,&quot; the PSAs were created with the 

pro bono assistance of world-renowned photographer Albert Watson. 

The spots feature a diverse cross-section of individuals and remind 

the nation, particularly during this time of crisis, that hate will 

not stop hate and that it is un-American to discriminate against 

individuals based on who they are. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dave Matthews said, &quot;We, as Americans and as members of the 

world community, must be united in our mourning, focused in our 

anger, and united in our resolve to find appropriate solutions. Let 

us find strength and comfort in the wisdom and diversity of this 

great land and not stray from the promise of America.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acclaimed photographer Albert Watson, said, &quot;I was honored to 

respond to Dave Matthews' call and lend a hand. It is critically 

important that we teach our youth and ourselves about our 

differences and in doing so, de-bunk the myths associated with 

people who are perceived as being different.&quot; Watson added, &quot;That 

is the greatest gift of America -- that we can take a tragedy and 

turn it into a positive.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights/Education Fund, 

affiliated with the nation's largest and most diverse civil rights 

coalition, is the sponsoring organization for the PSA campaign. 

Through its web site, www.civilrights.org and a toll-free number, 

1-800-558-5233, the Leadership Conference will provide the public 

with anti-discrimination information, resources, and effective 

counteraction tools in the fight against hate violence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Karen McGill Lawson, Executive Director of the Leadership 

Conference Education Fund, said: &quot;We are pleased to lend our 

support to this very important effort and we applaud Dave Matthews, 

Albert Watson, and the countless other individuals and institutions 

who contributed to this project for their extraordinary expression 

of goodwill. Efforts like this demonstrate that this nation will 

not allow this tragedy to deter us from continuing our journey 

towards social and economic justice.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dave Matthews added, &quot;No thanks are due me. Each of us is 

searching for a way to help repair the damage that has been done to 

this country. The PSA is a small gesture of brother and sisterhood 

that I am happy to make.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PSAs are being distributed to national television and cable 

networks and also will be aired online at www.civilrights.org. AOL 

Time Warner has agreed to support the campaign by airing the spots 

on their cable network and through an online banner ad campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional support for the PSAs was provided by Jack Rovner, 

President, RCA Records, and many other RCA Records staff. The 

Internet component of the campaign was created through the donated 

services of Highwheel Design Group, Inc 

(<a href="http://www.highwheeldesigngroup.com" target="_new">www.highwheeldesigngroup.com</a>). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights/Education Fund is the 

nation's largest and most diverse civil and human rights coalition 

of more than 180 national organizations whose members include more 

than 50 million Americans. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.civilrights.org" target="_new">www.civilrights.org</a>. </i></font></p>
