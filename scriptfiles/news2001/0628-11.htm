- June 28 - An estimated 4.2 million people in the Washington DC metro area, and more than 58 million people in 50 cities nationwide, will breathe air that exceeds federal health standards for ozone smog today, according to ozone forecasts posted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Meanwhile, the EPA and the Department of Justice, at the direction of the White House, has stalled Clean Air Act enforcement actions pending a review of a program that has the potential of reducing hundreds of thousands of tons of pollution each year.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If the Clean Air Act were enforced, a major part of the pollution that causes these unhealthy smog days would be eliminated,&#148; said U.S. PIRG Staff Attorney Rebecca Stanfield. &#147;Instead, President Bush is telling polluters to ignore the law and he&#146;ll give them a pardon,&#148; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 1999 study estimated that smog pollution causes 6 million asthma attacks and sends 150,000 Americans to hospital emergency rooms each year in the Eastern U.S. alone. Smog is formed when pollution from power plants and automobiles mix with other compounds in the air and is baked by the heat and sunlight. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;For more than 15 million asthmatics in the U.S., smoggy days mean missed school, missed work, and less fun in the sun,&#148; said Stanfield. &#147;Children and the elderly are especially susceptible to the health impacts of breathing dirty air,&#148; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, the U.S. EPA launched a 90-day review of the rules that require the oldest and dirtiest power plants and refineries to install modern pollution controls when they significantly increase their pollution levels. This review and a simultaneous DOJ review of pending enforcement actions were mandated by the Bush Energy Plan, and together effectively freeze dozens of lawsuits against violators, many of whom were in settlement discussions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Bush Energy Plan is dirty, dangerous, and doesn&#146;t deliver for consumers, and this is just one more example of that,&#148; said Stanfield. &#147;Taking the air pollution cops off the beat will not give Americans the smarter, cleaner energy future we all deserve,&#148; she continued.</font></p>
