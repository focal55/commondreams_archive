- June 28 - &quot;Vieques is of global importance. It represents the reclamation of thousands of communities around the world that are threatened by the presence and exercises of the Armed Forces,&quot; states Barbara Bird, spokesperson, for the American Friends Service Committee's recent delegation to Vieques Island. The group, composed of Board members and staff, returned from Puerto Rico and the island of Vieques today and spoke of their observations and findings at a press conference at the organization's national office in Philadelphia. The delegation went to Vieques to assess the impact of the naval exercises on the society, people and environment of the island. Naval exercises on the island resumed on June 18, 2001. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It was impressive to see the moral strength of the Puerto Rican people facing the power of the US Military&quot; said Marcy Wenzler, attorney and member of the AFSC Board of Directors. &quot;As a Quaker organization working for peace, we support the people of Vieques in their non-violent struggle to regain control of the island, assure the restoration of its environment and build a sustainable economy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation was made up of people from Philippines, Hawaii, Brazil, Guatemala, Puerto Rico and the United States. Kyle Kajihiro, from Hawaii and Baltazar Pingual, from the Philippines, agreed that it is important for the Navy to clean and decontaminate the lands they occupy. &quot;Because armed forces hide behind sovereign immunity and under the pretense of national defense, they fail to fulfill their moral responsibility to guarantee a healthy atmosphere for the people who live near military facilities.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 18-mile long island of Vieques has been used for military training since 1941. Its 9,400 inhabitants must live in the middle of the island, wedged in between the Navy's &quot;live impact area&quot; on the eastern end and ammunition storage on the western end. 70% of the island lives below the poverty line. Studies have documented negative health effects on the island's people including increased rates of cancer, heart disease, hypertension, infant mortality, diabetes and asthma. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice. </i></font></p>
