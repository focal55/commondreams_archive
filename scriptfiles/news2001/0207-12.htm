- February 7 - As President Bush continued to push his tax cut plan today with

families he said would gain from it, the National Women's Law

Center criticized the Administration's proposal for leaving

low-income families out of its potential benefits. If there is to

be a tax cut, any proposed "marriage penalty fix" should be

extended to include low-income couples and the child tax credit and

the child and dependent care tax credit should be made refundable.

These measures would allow families who do not earn enough income

to pay taxes to also benefit, said NWLC.

<p>In responding to President Bush's comment that he wants to

dismantle the "toll booth on the road to the middle class," Nancy

Duff Campbell, NWLC Co-President, said, "Unfortunately this plan

has ignored the many roadblocks that remain for low-income

families, so many of whom are headed by women."

<p>For example, Campbell praised Bush's approach to fixing the

marriage penalty -- which currently causes some married couples to

pay higher taxes than they would if they were single -- by allowing

them to deduct from their taxable income up to $3,000 of the second

earner's pay. By structuring the marriage penalty fix in this way,

the plan targets middle-income couples with two earners. However,

low-income couples that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit are hit

with the most substantial marriage penalties, but get little or no

relief under Bush's plan. "President Bush's second-earner

deduction approach works for many middle-income couples, but fails

to recognize that low-income couples are also penalized when they

marry. It's only fair that they are included in the marriage

penalty fix," said Campbell.

<p>Campbell also expressed support for the President's move to

increase the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000 per child,

because it recognizes the greater expenses of families with

children, but criticized the proposal for not making the child tax

credit refundable so that low-income families, who are most in need

of help in meeting these expenses, would benefit.

<p>In addition, the Administration's proposal fails to recognize

that one of the largest expenses for working families is child

care. Yet, the child and dependent care tax credit, which helps

families pay for these expenses, has not even been increased for

inflation since 1981. For this reason, bipartisan legislation has

been introduced in Congress to increase the credit and make it

refundable so that the lowest income families can get help with

their child care costs. "Real tax relief for families would

address one of the largest expenses for families -- child care,"

said Campbell.

<p>Campbell reiterated that the Administration's plan, as a whole,

is unfairly skewed toward tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans.

In a statement issued Tuesday, Campbell criticized the President's

move to eliminate the estate tax because it would benefit only the

top five percent of tax filers and do nothing for the overwhelming

majority of women and their families who do not stand to gain from

inherited wealth. In a statement issued Monday, Campbell said that

the size of the proposed tax cut poses a serious threat to Social

Security, Medicare and other safety net programs, including the

need to make increased investments in areas critical to women and

their families such as education, child care and health care.

<p>Campbell has over 30 years' experience in tax law and policy,

especially as it pertains to women and their families. She serves

on the board of the Community Tax Law Report and chaired the

national Coalition on Women and Taxes during the 1986 tax reform

debates.

<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-partisan, non-profit

organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and

of importance to women and their families including economic

security, education, employment and health, with special attention

given to the concerns of low-income women. </i>
