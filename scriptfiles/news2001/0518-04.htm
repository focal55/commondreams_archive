- May 18 - President Bush introduced America to the idea of compassionate conservatism, and indeed Bush has demonstrated a high level of compassion.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his compassion has been reserved for the moneyed interests who filled his political coffers and helped to secure his theft of the Presidency.&nbsp; Afterall, special interest groups contributed an unprecedented amount of campaign contributions, and now the chickens have come home to roost.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Bush calls himself a 'Reformer with results'.&nbsp; But he only seems bent on reforming laws that were intended to protect America's families, America's workers, and America's environment.&nbsp; The results have been a boon for corporate interests, and devastating for the American people.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Lets take a look at what the Bush Administration has done for our nation's energy policy.</font></P>

<UL>

<LI><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Energy interests gave $2.9 millionto Bush for his political campaign, and then kicked in an additional $2.2 million for his inauguration fund;</font></LI>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Former Oil Executive, Dick Cheney, formulates crucial energy policy decisions behind closed doors.&nbsp; When Hillary Clinton put her task force together the Republicans filed a lawsuit to open the records!&nbsp;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Cheney's task force focuses heavily on incentives for production; easing regulatory barriers for energy development; and opening more public lands to drilling including national monuments and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Bush appointed Gale Norton as Secretary of Interior because she believes that corporations have a constitutional right to pollute;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Gale Norton's first concrete attempt at a regulatory rollback was a proposal to gut updated environmental mining regulations.&nbsp; Independent reports estimate that taxpayers could be on the hook for about $1 billion in environmental cleanup costs from today's mines;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">He did a big favor for major electricity wholesalers by keeping the federal government largely out of theCalifornia energy crisis, which has produced major profits for energy companies based in Bush's home state of Texas;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Bush showed his loyalty to the coal mining and electricity industries when he reversed a campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; </font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Bush endangered the world's future and damaged our credibility in the International community when he announced the United States' withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol; </font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Despite objections from his brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he plans on auctioning offshore oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Seems that natural gas is thicker than blood;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Bush's budget proposes slashing more than $200 million from federal renewable energy and efficiency research programs, even as his administration declares the United States needs to find ways to cope with an &quot;energy crisis&quot;;&nbsp; </font></LI>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">From taxpayer subsidized timber to exclusive drilling rights in endangered wilderness, it seems that the oil and timber barons will have an open invitation to feed at the public trough;</font></LI>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000"><BR>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">And while the Bush Administration readies its chainsaw budget that rips our social safety net to shreds, its produced an energy bill that transfers a tidy sum - about $24 Billion - to oil and energy companies;</font></LI>

</font>



<LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000000">Now, the Administration is in a state of apoplexy because Americans, by a remarkable 7-to-1 margin, think that Bush is less concerned about protecting the environment than about protecting the interests of the energy industry.&nbsp; He's given us every right to believe that his Administration is nothing but a shill for forces bent on turning back the clock on environmental progress;</font></LI>
