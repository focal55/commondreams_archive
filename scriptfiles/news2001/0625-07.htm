- June 25 - Two weeks before the House of Representatives is scheduled to consider campaign finance reform legislation, a Supreme Court ruling today reaffirmed Congress&#146;s wide latitude to limit the corrupting influence of money on politics.</font>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Supreme Court&#146;s decision is a major setback for reform opponents who have tried to use the Constitution to derail campaign finance reform bills before Congress,&#148; said E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.  &#147;A majority of the Court understands exactly how the power of money is used in our elections.  The opinion&#146;s language is very strong.  The Court was concerned that large donors contribute to party committees to buy &#145;obligated officeholders.&#146;&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">        In Federal Election Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, the Supreme Court found constitutional a longstanding law restricting the amount of money that political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates.  The Court recognized that coordinated spending of money donated to a party is &#147;tailor made to undermine contribution limits&#148; and has the &#147;power to corrupt.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brennan Center filed an amicus brief on behalf of 14 prominent political scientists urging the Court to uphold the restrictions on political party spending.  The Supreme Court&#146;s opinion cites the Brennan Center&#146;s brief in rejecting the Colorado Republican Party&#146;s argument.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Supreme Court ruled that money funneled into political parties can be as corrupting as money put directly in the pockets of candidates,&#148; explained Mr. Rosenkranz.  &#147;Today&#146;s ruling supports the position of reformers who are asking Congress to close the soft money loophole.&#148; </font></p>

<p>        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Supreme Court clearly understands how election laws are routinely evaded.  Not only did the Court reject arguments that parties deserve more constitutional protection than other political players,&#148; said Mr. Rosenkranz, &#147;the Court explained that limits on coordinated party spending are essential for preserving the integrity of our campaigns.  The very same reasoning applies to a ban on unregulated soft money.&#148;</font></p>
