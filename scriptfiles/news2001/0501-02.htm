<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Lead is a persistent and highly toxic substance that can cause 

a range of environmental and health problems,&quot; Bush said in a 

statement. &quot;It has an especially harmful impact on the health of 

children and infants.&quot;</font></i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> -- The Washington Post, April 18, 2001 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 1 -  The Violence Policy Center (VPC) and the Environmental 

        Working Group (EWG) today released <a href="../studies/leadcont.htm"><i>Poisonous 

        Pastime: The Health Risks of Shooting Ranges and Lead to Children, Families, 

        and the Environment</i>.</a> The 71-page study documents how shooting 

        ranges are poisoning children and polluting the environment with lead, 

        yet remain almost entirely unregulated—exempt from even the Bush Administration's 

        new lead pollution reporting rules. 

      

</font></p>

<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><P><i><a href="../studies/leadcont.htm">Poisonous Pastime</a></i> documents 

        how parents often put their own children at risk because they do not know 

        that their visits to the local shooting range can result in lead poisoning 

        of their children at home. Lead poisoning is known to cause terribly debilitating 

        and sometimes fatal effects on children and adults. 

      

<P>"There is no question that the toxic levels of lead at shooting ranges 

        are endangering America's children and families," VPC Senior Policy Analyst 

        and report author Tom Diaz said today. "No amount of lead exposure is 

        known to be completely safe for a child. <a href="../studies/leadcont.htm"><i>Poisonous 

        Pastime</i></a> reveals for the first time that the gun industry—through 

        toxic and unregulated ranges—is sacrificing the health of our children 

        for profit." 

      

<P><i><a href="../studies/leadcont.htm">Poisonous Pastime</a></i> details 

        how outdoor firing ranges put more lead into the environment than nearly 

        any other major industrial sector in the U.S., yet they remain almost 

        entirely unregulated. In just two years a typical outdoor firing range 

        can have lead contamination equivalent to a five-acre Superfund site.

      

<P>The study reveals how school administrators throughout the country were 

        oblivious to the dangers of lead—from school shooting ranges—until students 

        were found to have elevated blood levels. 

      

<P>"Every one of the 1,800 firing ranges in the U.S. represents a piece 

        of land so highly contaminated with lead that it would require a massive 

        clean-up effort to be safe for wildlife or any industrial or residential 

        use," said EWG Research Director Jane Houlihan. 

      

<P><i><a href="../studies/leadcont.htm">Poisonous Pastime</a></i> finds 

        that the shooting range industry downplays the seriousness of its problems, 

        hides them from the general public, and allow thousands of unregulated 

        shooting sites to continue to operate without strict oversight. It is 

        based largely on the records of internal industry meetings and gun industry 

        publications. The report includes recommendations at both local and federal 

        levels.
