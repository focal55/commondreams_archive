- October 10 - The Sierra Club today praised Democrats in the House of Representatives for electing environmental champion Rep. Nancy Pelosi

(D-CA) as the House Minority Whip.  Rep. Pelosi will succeed Rep. David

Bonior (D-MI), who will step down in January, 2002.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Executive Director Carl Pope issued the following statement:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rep. Pelosi's election is among the best news for America's environment

this century.  Rep. Pelosi is a treasured friend of the environment and we

look forward to continuing to work with her to protect our most fragile

places and defend human rights around the world.  We are thrilled that

House Democrats selected her as their second in command and we want to

extend our warmest congratulations to her.  Rep. Pelosi is a worthy

successor of Rep. David Bonior, who has always made protecting the

environment a priority.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;From the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to the redrock canyons

of Utah to all of our national forests,  she has been a leader in

protecting our pristine places.  When Americans gaze at vistas explored by

Lewis and Clark, they can thank Rep. Pelosi for helping to keep the

landscape unspoiled.  As a vocal defender of human rights of

environmentalists around the world, she has worked alongside the Sierra

Club on behalf of Ken Saro-Wiwa and Alexander Nikitin.  To slow the threats

our growing population has on our environment, Rep. Pelosi has been a key

supporter of family planning initiatives both at home and abroad.&quot;</font></p>
