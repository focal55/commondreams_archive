- April 9 - Following is a 

statement by Jennifer Morgan, director, Climate Change Campaign, 

World Wildlife Fund: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush's budget is a blueprint for increasing global 

warming offering backward-looking solutions at a time when 

Americans want to look forward toward a sustainable energy 

future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush has acknowledged the threat global warming 

poses to the environment. Yet, his budget will only exacerbate 

this threat, by slashing important energy efficiency and 

renewable energy programs that help curb carbon emissions. 

President Bush is again assaulting efforts to address global 

warming. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Department of Energy has noted that its most successful 

energy efficiency and renewable energy activities have already 

saved consumers and businesses around $30 billion. Rather than 

expanding these programs to reduce consumer energy bills and global warming pollution, President Bush has cut some of these 

programs by 50 percent or more and proposed expanding oil and 

coal exploration. This will do nothing to comfort Americans 

faced with high energy prices this summer, and only further harm air quality. These industry subsidies for dirty fuels are not 

the energy policy answers Americans are looking for. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Administration wants America to believe that there is a 

clean, environmentally benign way to explore for out dated 

fossil fuels. There isn't. Drilling in the Arctic National 

Wildlife Refuge, as the President endorses, will fundamentally 

alter the habitat and landscape of one of America's last 

pristine wilderness areas. In addition, saying we can have &quot;clean coal&quot; is like saying we can have healthy cigarettes. 

Heavy carbon fuels like coal are the biggest contributors to 

global warming, and we must instead invest in advanced clean 

energy technologies and sources. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The world - other governments, Americans, and endangered 

wildlife -- is waiting for us to take action to stop global 

warming. The Administration's current position increases global 

warming and threatens communities and wildlife around the 

globe.&quot; </font></p>
