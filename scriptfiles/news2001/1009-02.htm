- October 9 -Greenpeace released an updated version of The True Food Shopping List today, dividing thousands of common foods into genetically engineered (GE) and GE-free categories. This is the only comprehensive reference available to shoppers in the U.S. who want to avoid genetically engineered foods. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The only defense Americans have against genetically engineered foods is this guide,&quot; said Kimberly Wilson, Greenpeace Genetic Engineering Campaigner. &quot;The FDA has been denying shoppers their right to know what they buy since it refused to label genetically engineered foods in 1992. Greenpeace is giving shoppers the power to choose alternatives.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The original True Food Shopping List was released one year ago. Now the updated version contains almost 200 new food products that have not been genetically engineered in 20 categories, from baby food and cereal to frozen foods and soups. The list illustrates a dramatic shift in the food industry away from engineered foods. Companies like Beech Nut and Whole Foods Market have changed their policies in the past year and eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from some or all of their products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Whole Foods Market has made the decision to prohibit the use of ingredients from genetically engineered crops in its private label lines,&quot; said a Whole Foods Market spokesperson. &quot;Whole Foods maintains a program of random product testing to ensure their policies are honored.&quot; In contrast, companies such as Kellogg's refuse to offer GE-free alternatives or label their products, in spite of tens of thousands of calls from concerned customers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The good thing is, most foods out there are still not genetically engineered,&quot; added Wilson. &quot;This list can help shoppers avoid those foods that are.&quot;</font></p>
