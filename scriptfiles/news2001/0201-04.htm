- February 1 - On the heels of the

Senate's narrow vote to confirm John Ashcroft as Attorney General,

the National Women's Law Center pledged vigilance in holding

Ashcroft, and the Bush Administration, accountable for their

assurances on women's constitutional rights, civil rights and other

important legal protections. Marcia D. Greenberger, NWLC's

Co-President, testified against Senator Ashcroft's confirmation

before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 18.

<p>"We will fight the new leadership at the Justice Department and

the Administration every step of the way if they attempt to roll

back decades of legal advances for women and their families," said

Greenberger. "And we will hold the Senate responsible for making

sure John Ashcroft keeps the promises those who supported his

nomination insist he made."

<p>Greenberger added, "The historic level of grassroots opposition

to this nomination sends a clear message that the American people

strongly disagree with the appointment of ideologues and extremists

who have a record of distorting the law to fit their own aims. We

hope that President Bush heard the outcry and will take heed as he

selects other important executive branch appointments and nominates

judges to the federal bench."

<p>With the confirmation of Senator Ashcroft -- along with the

other anti-choice, anti-family planning positions of the Bush

Administration and with Roe v. Wade hanging by a 5-4 thread in the

Supreme Court -- women are now in danger of losing their right to

choose more than at any other time since 1973. The Attorney

General's vast powers could allow John Ashcroft to render Roe

basically inoperative without his ever having to publicly call for

overturning it. Much of this effort could be done outside the

light of public or judicial scrutiny.

<p>John Ashcroft's record of antipathy to women's concerns, civil

rights and equal opportunity demonstrates that the threat he poses

extends beyond the right to choose. Not only did Senator Ashcroft

use distortion tactics to sabotage the nominations of Judge Ronnie

White and James Hormel, but he also opposed numerous highly

qualified female nominees to the federal bench including Margaret

Morrow, against whom he also leveled unsubstantiated charges. As

Governor, Ashcroft vetoed a maternity leave law that was far more

limited in scope than the federal Family and Medical Leave Act he

will now be charged with defending as Attorney General, and twice

used the line-item veto to seek out and strike even small sums of

money for domestic violence programs -- especially troubling given

that he will now administer a major program to combat violence

against women. "The close votes in the Committee and on the Senate

floor strongly demonstrate that the American people do not want the

extreme positions and unfair tactics from John Ashcroft's past to

re-surface in the future. We'll be working to make sure that

doesn't happen," said Greenberger.

<p><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-partisan, non-profit

organization that has been working since 1972 to advance and

protect women's legal rights. NWLC joined an unprecedented,

broad-based coalition of women's rights, reproductive rights, civil

rights, labor, gun control and environmental groups in opposing the

confirmation of John Ashcroft as Attorney General.
