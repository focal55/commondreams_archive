- November 6 - The lack of 

transparency and public participation in the climate negotiations 

will further worsen conditions for Indigenous Peoples, people of 

color and workers in the United States and U.S.-Mexico border. 

Speakers from Indigenous Environmental Network, Southwest Network 

for Environmental and Economic Justice, CorpWatch and Redefining 

Progress held a briefing on Tuesday in Marrakech, bringing issues 

of racial justice and worker's rights to the center of the climate 

change negotiations. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Climate change is a reality in North America, and those least 

responsible for creating the problem -- Indigenous Peoples and 

communities of color, in particular -- will be the hardest hit. 

They have the least resources to cope with climatic changes -- a 

direct result of institutional racism in the United States. In 

addition, the legacy of environmental racism in the United States 

and the U.S.-Mexico border has ensured that these communities are 

also hardest hit by environmental injustices, be they the dumping 

of nuclear waste, the siting of coal fired power plants and 

refineries or even the lack of adequate public transportation in 

communities of color. Various studies have clearly established that 

race plays a major factor in the siting of polluting industries in 

the United States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The corporate lobby has been very instrumental in derailing the 

negotiations on climate change and promising false solutions. &quot;The 

Bush administration has sold out the interests of indigenous 

communities and communities of color to the fossil fuel industry 

that supported his election,&quot; said Tom Goldtooth of the Indigenous 

Environmental Network. &quot;We need real solutions that address the 

root causes of climate change and environmental racism, not 

corporate solutions like carbon trading that will not do anything 

to stop greenhouse gases in the United States -- a society addicted 

to fossil fuels,&quot; added Goldtooth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil and other fossil fuel corporations are pushing the world to 

the edge of ecological havoc. At the same time, they continue to 

relentlessly destroy the health and well being of local communities 

and ecosystems where profits from oil are to be found -- be it in 

the predominantly African American &quot;Cancer Alley,&quot; the Gwich'in 

natives near the Arctic Refuge or Latinos in Austin, Texas. 

&quot;Clearly, holding corporations accountable for the central role 

they play in perpetuating these local injustices as well as 

contributing to climate change is key to any solution to achieve 

Climate Justice. The United States, which accounts for a quarter 

of CO2 emissions, must also be held accountable to forging genuine 

solutions,&quot; said Amit Srivastava of CorpWatch. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For Indigenous People and people of color, climate change is a 

matter of life and death,&quot; said Ansje Miller of Redefining 

Progress. &quot;Yet, our government turns its back on Americans most 

vulnerable to climate change by saying that we can't afford to 

address the problem. The truth is, we can't afford not to.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Any solution must ensure the need for communities and workers 

to live in a safe, healthy, and clean environment and requires a 

just transition to build sustainable jobs and communities. To 

ensure these rights, we have to build a grassroots movement for 

Climate Justice that integrally links human rights, environmental 

justice and labor rights by including communities and workers in 

articulating the solutions,&quot; said Cipriana Jurado of the Southwest 

Network of Environmental and Economic Justice, who works on the 

U.S.-Mexico border for the binational network.
