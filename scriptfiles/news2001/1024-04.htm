<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - October 24 - The following is a 

statement of Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The so-called &quot;economic stimulus&quot; tax bill reported by the 

Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee, and 

scheduled for House consideration today, should be labeled for what 

it is, &quot;The War Profiteers Act of 2001.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This egregious legislation represents an attempt during a time 

of war to distribute tens of billions of dollars of unjustifiable 

tax giveaways to undeserving beneficiaries that would never have 

seen the light of day prior to September 11, 2001. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation also represents a brazen attempt to open the 

door to tens of millions of dollars in soft money contributions 

from the intended beneficiaries of this tax bonanza. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This tax bill qualifies as the longest and most expensive 

political fundraising letter in American history. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill almost had it right when he 

called the Ways and Means tax bill &quot;show business&quot; for 

&quot;constituents.&quot; In fact, the tax bill is a &quot;multibillion-dollar 

offering&quot; for &quot;campaign contributors.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without question, the most extraordinary and indefensible 

provision in this legislation would not only repeal the alternative 

minimum tax (AMT) on corporations but would do so retroactively to 

1986. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AMT provision was enacted in 1986 during the Reagan 

Administration to ensure that corporations pay at least some 

federal income taxes on their profits. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By making repeal of the corporate AMT tax retroactive for 

fifteen years, the Republican members of the Ways and Means 

Committee have exploded its cost from $4 billion to $25 billion and 

would give away billions of tax dollars to corporations as if they 

were the world's most expensive party favors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a time when thousands of citizens have died in terrorist 

attacks, hundreds of thousands of citizens have lost their jobs 

and Americans are fighting a war in defense of our country, the 

Ways and Means Committee bill is proposing to hand out 

multi-billion dollar tax breaks to corporations and wealthy 

individuals that are unjustified, unearned and unfair. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Ways and Means Committee tax bill is an insult to the 

American people and an affront to the ideal of shared sacrifice 

that is called for during this time of war and uncertainty. </font></p>
