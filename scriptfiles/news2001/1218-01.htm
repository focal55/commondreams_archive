<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- December 18 - The gun industry has 

unleashed a new wave of smaller, lighter versions of adult firearms 

and as marketing them as youth models for use by children as young 

as four years old, according to a 21-page study released today by 

the Violence Policy Center (VPC). The study, &quot;'A .22 For 

Christmas' -- How the Gun Industry Designs and Markets Firearms for 

Children and Youth,&quot; reveals how the gun industry -- working 

hand-in-hand with the National Rifle Association (NRA) and gun 

industry trade group the National Shooting Sports Foundation 

(NSSF) -- is targeting children to ensure its fiscal and political 

future. As Handguns magazine stated this summer regarding children 

and guns: &quot;they are our salvation in the fight for liberty and the 

preservation of the shooting sports.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The gun industry promises that a gun in a child's hand is a 

short-cut to responsibility and maturity. In fact, the only 

guarantee is one of increased risk of death and injury,&quot; states 

Marty Langley, VPC policy analyst and study author. &quot;The firearms 

industry and gun lobby are attempting to secure their own survival 

by endangering that of our children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In spite of recent reports of short-term spikes in gun sales 

following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, gun ownership overall has 

been steadily declining for several decades. As a spokesman for 

handgun manufacturer Glock lamented in 1996, &quot;grandpa or dad isn't 

taking the kid out into the field to teach him how to shoot 

anymore.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A .22 for Christmas&quot; details more than 40 youth firearms from 

20 manufacturers and reveals gun lobby efforts to entice children 

through the promotion of such activities as &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;combat&quot; 

shooting, where participants navigate a run-and-gun, self-defense 

course using a wide range of weapons and &quot;Cowboy Action&quot; shooting, 

where participants dress up and take part in &quot;wild west&quot; scenarios. 

It also reveals how the gun lobby explains that smaller, 

low-caliber handguns can be used to fit the small hands of 

children. And while the gun industry promises that such training 

virtually guarantees good citizenship, the exact opposite may be 

true. In 1998, 11-year-old Andrew Golden -- who had been taught 

combat shooting by his father -- and 13-year-old Mitchell Johnson 

ambushed their classmates at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, 

Arkansas, killing four students and a teacher while wounding 10 

others. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study reveals how gunmakers openly acknowledge their desire 

to cultivate an expanded youth market, even though to purchase a 

firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer the buyer must be 21 

years old for a handgun, and 18 years old for a rifle or shotgun. 

Weapons can be purchased for children by adults, however, with 

limited federal age restrictions. In the study, the VPC recommends 

that federal law be changed so that possession restrictions match 

those for sales. </font></p>
