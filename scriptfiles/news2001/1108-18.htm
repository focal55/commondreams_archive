decision of the Mexican government today to release two imprisoned

environmentalists. The groups cautioned that much more needs to be done to

ensure the safety of these heroes by recognizing their innocence and

bringing justice to the perpetrators of the human rights abuses committed

against them.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera are environmental defenders who have

undergone tremendous hardship for their work to protect their forests,&quot;

said Alejandro Queral of the Sierra Club. &quot;We are happy that they have been

released, but defenders of human rights and the environment in Mexico will

not be truly free and safe until those who threaten, torture and murder

these heroes are brought to justice.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are pleased that these men have been released,&quot; said Diego Zavala,

Amnesty International, USA's Mexico Country Specialist and liaison to its

Just Earth! Program which has been working on the case since 1999. &quot;However

we are concerned that President Fox based his decision on humanitarian

reasons without mentioning the human rights abuses committed against them

or recognizing their innocence. Conditions for human rights workers and

environmental defenders are still very dangerous in Mexico, particularly in

light of the recent murder of human rights lawyer Digna Ochoa.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 2, 1999, Mr. Montiel and Mr. Cabrera were arrested by members of the

Mexican Army. During the raid, the soldiers shot and killed Salom&eacute; Sanchez

Ortiz, a local farmer. Mr. Montiel and Mr. Cabrera were subsequently

beaten, tortured and forced to confess to drugs and weapons-related

charges. On August 28, 2000, Mr. Montiel and Mr. Cabrera were convicted and

sentenced to six-year and ten-year jail terms respectively. Last October, a

judge denied an appeal to the two men. In October, a petition was filed in

the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights by the defendants lawyers,

Sierra Club, Greenpeace International, and the Center for Justice and

International Law. The petition, which asks for an investigation into the

torture and illegal arrests will not be withdrawn from the Commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The release of the environmentalists comes less than a month after the

murder of their original defense lawyer, prominent human rights defender

Digna Ochoa, who was shot to death on October 19 in her office in Mexico

City. Ochoa's murderers left behind a note threatening workers at human

rights center PRODH, raising concerns for their safety and that of all

human rights and environmental activists in Mexico.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is tragic that Digna cannot be here to celebrate the release of Montiel

and Cabrera,&quot; said Carmen Reed of Amnesty International, USA. &quot;Her murder

and the threats left behind are stark reminders that the struggle for the

protection of human rights and environmental defenders does not end with

Montiel and Cabrera's release.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This step from the government of President Fox must be followed through

with investigations into the torture and other abuses conducted by the

Mexican Army against the two activists,&quot;  said Queral.  &quot;Finding those

responsible and bringing them to justice will help guarantee the safety of

Montiel and Cabrera and other environmental and human rights defenders in

Mexico.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amnesty International and Sierra Club believe that the arrest and

conviction of the two environmentalists stem solely from their efforts to

stop the rampant logging in the southern state of Guerrero, Mexico. Both

men were declared prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International. Mr.

Montiel, one of the founding members of the Organization of Campesino

Environmentalists of the Sierra de Petatl&aacute;n and Coyuca de Catal&aacute;n, is a

recipient of Sierra Club's Chico Mendes award for environmental heroism and

of the Goldman Environmental Prize. His efforts to organize farmers to

oppose the rampant and possibly illegal logging in the mountains in

Guerrero, Mexico, and his plight at the hands of the Mexican government

have earned worldwide respect and admiration. Thousands of people around

the world wrote to the Mexican government expressing support for Mr.

Montiel and Mr. Cabrera.
