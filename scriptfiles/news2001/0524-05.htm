- May 24 - More than one in four (26%) of the nation&#146;s largest industrial, municipal, and federal facilities were in serious violation of the Clean Water Act at least once during a recent 15-month period, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG.  Polluters&#146; Playground: How the Government Permits Pollution describes many shortcomings in the monitoring of water pollution and efforts to deter polluters, at the same time that the Bush Administration has proposed cutting the EPA&#146;s budget for enforcement.</font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is outrageous that the Bush Administration is proposing to slash enforcement budgets when more than one in four polluting facilities are breaking the law,&#148; said U.S. PIRG Environmental Advocate Richard Caplan.  &#147;We need clean water now, and we have to start by requiring polluters to obey the law.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG analyzed the behavior of major facilities nationwide by reviewing violations of the Clean Water Act between October of 1998 and December of 1999, recorded in the U.S. EPA&#146;s Permit Compliance System database, obtained by U.S. PIRG under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major findings of the report include:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ten states with the greatest number of major facilities in Significant Non-Compliance (SNC) were Texas, Ohio, New York, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Florida, Missouri, and Indiana.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ten states with the highest percentage of major facilities in SNC were Utah, Tennessee, Ohio, Vermont, Missouri, Oklahoma, Alabama, Rhode Island, Nebraska, and Indiana.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">159 major facilities were in SNC during the entire 15 month period.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 42 industrial facilities in SNC for the entire 15 month period, EPA records indicate only one received a fine over the past five years.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To bring about consistent compliance with permits and move toward the zero-discharge goals of the Clean Water Act, U.S. PIRG recommended the following:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set tougher penalties. Penalties should be set high enough to remove any economic incentive for polluters to break the law and to deter lawbreaking in the first place.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allow citizens full access to the courts. Obstacles to citizen suits should be removed, including the current rules that bar citizens from suing federal facilities.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expand the public&#146;s right to know.  The public should have greater access to information about enforcement, including the requirement of submissions of comprehensive data by facilities that discharge into waterways and easy accessible of that data through online Internet searches.

</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of the Clean Water Act was to make U.S. waterways fishable and swimmable by 1983, and to achieve zero discharge of pollutants to waterways by 1985.  In 2001, 40% of U.S. surface waters do not meet the fishable and swimmable standard.  Last year, Congressman Pallone (NJ-6) introduced legislation that would accomplish the recommendations listed above, and we expect him to introduce a similar bill soon.  Congress should work together to pass this important enforcement accountability and right-to-know legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We urge Congress and the President to listen to the public&#146;s demands for clean water.  The Administration&#146;s proposed cuts to the EPA&#146;s enforcement budget take us in the wrong direction at the wrong time,&quot; said U.S. PIRG&#146;s Caplan.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
