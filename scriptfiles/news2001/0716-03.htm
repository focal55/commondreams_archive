- July 16 - Commercial Alert filed a deceptive advertising complaint today with the

Federal Trade Commission against eight search engines, for placing ads

in search engine results without clear disclosure that the ads are ads.

The complaint states that such listings &quot;look like information from an

objective database selected by an objective algorithm.  But really they

are paid ads in disguise.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Companies named in the complaint include AltaVista Co., AOL Time Warner

Inc., Direct Hit Technologies, iWon Inc., LookSmart Ltd., Microsoft

Corp. and Terra Lycos S.A.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These search engines have chosen crass commercialism over editorial

integrity,&quot; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are asking the FTC to make sure that no one is tricked by the search

engines' descent into commercial deception,&quot; Ruskin said. &quot;If they are

going to stuff ads into search results, they should be required to say

that the ads are ads.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is just the latest example of how advertising is creeping into

every nook and cranny of our lives and culture,&quot; Ruskin said. &quot;Americans are tired of it, and the backlash is growing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The text of the complaint follows.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Donald Clark<br>

Secretary of the Commission<br>

Federal Trade Commission				<br>

600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room #172<br>

Washington, D.C. 20580</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RE:  Deceptive advertising complaint against AltaVista Co., AOL Time

Warner Inc., Direct Hit Technologies, iWon Inc., LookSmart Ltd.,

Microsoft Corp. and Terra Lycos S.A.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. Clark:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This letter constitutes a formal complaint against AltaVista Co., AOL

Time Warner Inc., Direct Hit Technologies, iWon Inc., LookSmart Ltd.,

Microsoft Corp. and Terra Lycos S.A., and a request that the Federal

Trade Commission (FTC) investigate whether these companies are violating

federal prohibitions against deceptive acts or practices (1) by

inserting advertisements in search engine results without clear and

conspicuous disclosure that the ads are ads.  This concealment may

mislead search engine users to believe that search results are based on

relevancy alone, not marketing ploys. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When search engine companies first unveiled their engines, they did not

put ads in the search results.  Results were displayed based on

objective criteria of relevancy tallied by algorithms.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the last year, however, some search engines sacrificed editorial

integrity for higher profits, and began placing ads prominently in the

results, but without clear disclosure of this practice.  Advertisers pay

the search engine companies to have their products and services listed

&quot;high&quot; in or near the search results.  Thus the listings look like

information from an objective database selected by an objective

algorithm.  But really they are paid ads in disguise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A:  Some Search Engine Practices May Constitute Deceptive Advertising </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For years, search engine companies have incorporated advertising into

their websites in ways that do not affect search results, such as banner

ads.  But some search engines have recently adopted three advertising

practices which may affect search results: paid placement, inclusion and

submission.  Paid placement is advertising that is outside of the

editorial content of the search results, sometimes above or below the

editorial content, or in a sidebar.  Paid inclusion is advertising

within the editorial content of the search results, though it does not

necessarily guarantee a certain position within the results.  Paid

submission is the practice of requiring payment to speed up the

processing of a listing, though it rarely guarantees that a site will in

fact be listed by the search engine.  This complaint concerns the

practices of paid placement and paid inclusion without clear and

conspicuous disclosure that the ads are, in fact, ads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In some search engines, disclosure of paid placement or inclusion in

some search engines is either non-existent or obfuscatory. (2)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Search Engine	Paid Placement	Paid Inclusion<br>

iWon.com	&quot;Featured Listings&quot;	No paid inclusion<br>

Lycos	&quot;Featured Listings&quot;	No paid inclusion<br>

MSN.com	&quot;Featured Sites&quot;	&quot;Web Directory Sites&quot;<br>

Netscape	&quot;Partner Search Results&quot;	No paid inclusion<br>

Altavista	&quot;Featured Sites&quot;	&quot;Results&quot;<br>

Direct Hit	&quot;Partner Search Results&quot;	No paid inclusion<br>

HotBot	&quot;Products &amp; Services&quot; and &quot;Featured Listings&quot; 	---------------<br>

LookSmart	&quot;Featured Listings&quot;	&quot;Reviewed Web Sites&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

News accounts suggest this deception is growing worse following the

so-called &quot;dot com crash&quot; and the reduction in banner ad sales.  For

example, Verne Kopytoff of the San Francisco Chronicle reported that:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once relatively objective, search engines are increasingly becoming

commercial. In an effort to survive the online industry's financial

struggles, they are providing links based not just on relevancy, but on

who pays for top billing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the past several months, most of the Internet's biggest portals

have added these so-called pay-for-placement search engines to their

repertoire. Yet in some cases, users are not explicitly told that the

top links provided to them are really advertisements in disguise.&quot; (3)  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not all search engine companies have adopted deceptive advertising

practices.  For example, Google clearly notes that its paid placements

are &quot;Sponsored Links,&quot; and it will not put paid ads within its search

results. &quot;We have no plans for a paid inclusion program,&quot; Google

spokesperson Cindy McCaffrey told SearchEngineWatch.com. &quot;[O]ur search

results represent our editorial integrity, and we have no plans to alter

our automated process, which works very well in gathering information

and delivering highly relevant results,&quot;(4)  she said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  

B:  The FTC Has Repeatedly Sought to Stop Companies From Concealing That

Their Ads Are Ads</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By concealing the key fact that their ads are ads, search engines appear

to be violating the federal prohibition against deceptive acts or

practices. This omission falls within a line of deceptive advertising

cases in which the FTC sought sanctions against companies that have hid

that their ads were ads.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FTC has brought many cases against producers of &quot;infomercials,&quot;

charging that &quot;the infomercials were deceptive in that they purported to

be independent programming rather than paid ads.&quot; (5)  For example, the

consent decree in Michael S. Levey forbids Mr. Levey from disseminating

any &quot;advertisement that misrepresents, directly or by implication, that

it is not a paid advertisement.&quot; (6)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

C: Paid Placement and Inclusion is Likely to Deceive Many Users of

Search Engines</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without clear disclosure of the inclusion of ads within search engine

results, even well-informed search engine users may not know whether a

listing is an ad. &quot;It's getting very difficult to tell whether a site

paid to be listed or not,&quot; Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch,

told The New York Times. (7)  If experts like Mr. Sullivan cannot easily

figure this out, it is unlikely that other search engine users can tell

whether any particular search engine result was a paid ad or not.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The deception is, of course, intentional. &quot;You don't want users to come

to your site thinking the information is being weighted by whoever pays

the highest price tag,'' (8) explained Christopher Todd, an analyst at

Forrester Research.

 

The likelihood of deception is enhanced by the lack of sophistication of

many of search engine users.  Search engines are now a commonplace part

of the quest for information and knowledge; almost every segment of

society uses them.  Many search engine users are children and teenagers

who may have limited cognitive abilities and an incomplete understanding

of the purpose of advertising.  They especially are likely to be

deceived by the failure to disclose that listings are paid ads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The failure to disclose that an ad is an ad is material because it can

ultimately affect consumers' purchasing decisions, by diverting their

attention to the advertisers.  This is, of course, the purpose of the

ad, and there is no question that the search listing ads in fact do

this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because of the earlier editorial integrity in search engine results,

there is an implied representation to search engine users that listings

are not skewed by marketing or commercialism.  Consumers are accustomed

to search engine protocols based on editorial integrity, and have not

been told of the departure from these protocols.  In effect, this is a

high-tech case of &quot;bait and switch.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This deception is especially important because so many Americans use the

Internet and search engines each day to find facts and information. 

About 167 million Americans have access to the Internet at home,

according to Nielsen/NetRatings.(9)  For many of these Internet users,

search engines have become both filter and gateway to learning and

knowledge.  That is a crucial role in any society.  The FTC should not

allow such a privileged role to become a platform for deception.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the FTC to fully investigate this matter and exercise any and

all of its powers to enjoin the companies listed in this complaint from

disseminating deceptive advertising, and to require them to disclose, in

a clear and conspicuous manner, that ads placed in search engine results<br>

are, in fact, ads. </font></p>
