- June 6 - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today finalized

radiation protection standards for the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository

that establish a regulatory framework for legalized radiological contamination in Nevada,

said environmental, public interest, and consumer advocacy groups today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is another example of the Bush Administration weakening environmental

regulations to keep a bad project alive,&quot; said Lisa Gue, policy analyst with Public

Citizen's Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yucca Mountain, located near Las Vegas, Nev., is currently the only site under

consideration for a potential dump for high-level radioactive waste generated by U.S.

commercial reactors and weapons facilities. Yucca Mountain sits above an aquifer

that is a critical source of water for irrigation, dairy farming and drinking water. The EPA is required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to set radiation protection

standards for the site. The agency released a proposed rule for comment in 1999. The final

rule was issued today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final EPA rule retains a standard for multiple pathways of 15 millirem per year and

a separate 4 millirem per year standard for exposure from groundwater. The

separate groundwater standard was a central focus of public comments to the agency during

the rulemaking process. However, the measures for implementing these standards continue to

be inconsistent with basic scientific and regulatory principles. For these reasons,

we oppose the final EPA rule. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The central weaknesses of the EPA standards include: 



</font>

<ul>

  

<ul>

    

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By arbitrarily limiting the standard to the first 10,000 years of operation, the dose

      limits for the repository do not account for the maximum radionuclide exposures that will

      be caused by Yucca Mountain, which are projected to occur much later.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The compliance point for determining conformity with the 4 millirem per year groundwater

      standard is located 18 km from the site, rather than within the site boundary.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA&#146;s dilution factor and distant point of compliance for the groundwater standard

      are contrary to the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA does not take into account the substantial radiation sources at the Nevada Test

      Site, which the Department of Energy estimates could have impacts on groundwater quality

      comparable to those of Yucca Mountain.</font></li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While we view the inclusion of a separate groundwater standard for

Yucca Mountain as a very important precedent, the EPA standards for Yucca Mountain will

not adequately protect the public,&quot; said David Adelman, senior attorney with Natural

Resources Defense Council. Moreover, the Bush Administration&#146;s standards undermine

the Safe Drinking Water Act by significantly weakening the implementation requirements for

the groundwater standard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public interest, environmental, and consumer advocacy organizations have closely

followed EPA's rulemaking process for this standard, and have consistently emphasized the

need for a stringent standard given the extremely toxic nature of high-level radioactive

waste and the lack of experience with geologic disposal. &quot;EPA's final rule does not

address many of our significant health and safety concerns associated with the Yucca

Mountain repository proposal,&quot; said Ruth Swanson, Associate Executive Director

of Physicians for Social Responsibility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the rule issued today contains a separate groundwater protection standard, the

final EPA standards for Yucca Mountain threaten public health and promote reliance on

dilution&#151;rather than containment&#151;of nuclear waste to meet regulatory

requirements. &quot;From the beginning, the process for devising standards for Yucca

Mountain has been driven by the intent to fit the standards to the site, rather than to

ensure that the public and the environment are adequately protected,&quot; said John

Hadder, northern Nevada coordinator with Citizen Alert. &quot;The standard issued today

continues this tradition.&quot;
