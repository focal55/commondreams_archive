- May 16 - The stops on President Bush's energy tour misrepresent the

reality of his energy policy.  While President Bush is offering several photo opportunities in front of relatively environmentally friendly power

and energy research plants in Minnesota, Iowa, and Pennsylvania on Thursday

and Friday, the real Bush Administration plan essentially ignores these high-tech, energy-efficient solutions.  Instead, President Bush's proposal

is heavily weighted to increased oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production,

while his budget proposal slashes funding for renewable energy and

efficiency by a third.

As part of a massive grassroots campaign, Sierra Club activists will hold

rallies and press conferences at polluting power plants that represent his

plan more honestly than the sites President Bush chose for his photo ops.

Additionally, the Sierra Club will run ads in newspapers in the cities

President Bush visits.

<p>

"President Bush should know the old Texas saying 'You can put your boots in

the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits.'  But by posing himself in front

of the kinds of environmentally responsible power plants that are

essentially ignored by his energy plan, he's trying to portray his plan as

something that it's not." said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra

Club.  "It would be more honest for President Bush to stand in front of the

dirty and dangerous coal and nuclear plants that his plan promotes."

<p>

In each of the cities on President Bush's tour, on the day before his

visits Sierra Club members and allies will hold press conferences at sites

that would be more fitting for his photo-ops.  Activists will also hold rallies on the days of President Bush's visits.

<p>

In St. Paul, MN President Bush will visit the District Energy co-generation

plant, but environmentalists will hold a press conference at a more honest

and representative venue for President Bush to visit -- the High Bridge coal-fired power plant.  They will have a ton of coal on hand, the amount

of asthma-triggering soot dumped into the air every day by the plant.  The

Bush Administration budget actually cuts by 30 percent energy efficiency

research and development that promotes efficient plants.

<p>

In Des Moines, IA, residents will point out that a presidential trip to a

near-by diesel fuel power plant would have been more honest than the

President's planned photo op at the Iowa Energy Center in Nevada, IA, which

researches energy efficiency.  The President's budget actually cuts

research in renewable energy and development programs by 37 percent and cuts energy efficient research and development by 30 percent.

<p>

Near Lancaster, PA, Sierra Club activists will hold an event near the Safe

Harbor Hydroelectric Plant and a press conference within view of the Three

Mile Island nuclear plant to underscore the fact the Bush Administration

policy has little to do with promoting the kind of environmentally

sensitive, fish-friendly hydroelectric power in place at safe Harbor.

Just last week the Bush administration made it easier for hydroelectric power plants to side-step environmental safeguards. Activists will also emphasize that because the Administration supports increased nuclear power,

a more appropriate trip for President Bush would have been to the nearby

Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant, the site of our nation's worst

nuclear accident.

<p>

"President Bush's energy plan won't work," said Pope. "It makes the wrong

choices, because we can't drill, dig or destroy our way out of our energy

problems. That's why we're pushing for a more honest, balanced policy that

promotes energy efficiency, uses clean renewable energy like wind and solar

power, and emphasizes responsible production.  Americans need an energy policy that provides quicker, cleaner, cheaper, and safer solutions for our

families and for our future.

<p>

<p><i>

The Sierra Club, America's oldest grassroots environmental organization, is

actively working to address the connections between population, environment

and natural resources by promoting international and domestic family

planning assistance.  We support voluntary, unrestricted, comprehensive family planning programs to foster a balance between global population and

natural resources.  We are working to reduce wasteful consumption to

protect the global environment and preserve natural resources for our

common future. </i>
