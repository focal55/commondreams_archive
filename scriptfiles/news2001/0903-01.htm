- September 3 -  The following is a 

statement by Ralph Nader on Labor Day, and American workers' rights: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Americans celebrate Labor Day and honor the nation's working 

people, we should all be ashamed that American labor law and 

American labor law enforcement makes a mockery of workers' basic 

rights to organize, join unions and exercise collective bargaining. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Workers face enormous obstacles to form a union and exercise 

fundamental rights once unionized. One in ten union supporters 

campaigning to form a union is fired illegally, and employers are 

effectively free to fire (&quot;permanently replace&quot;) workers on strike. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of the flawed framework of American labor law is traceable 

to the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. More than 50 years after its 

passage, it is time for Congress to repeal this denial of workers' 

civil rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employers and forces opposed to unions' right to exist passed 

Taft-Hartley in a climate of fear and anti-union zealotry. The 

result remains a heavily imbalanced labor law, which includes 

Taft-Hartley provisions that:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ban secondary boycotts, severely diminishing the organizing 

and bargaining power of labor unions.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Define &quot;employee&quot; to exclude supervisors and independent 

contractors. This diminishes the pool of workers eligible to be 

unionized. The exclusion of supervisors from union organizing 

activity has meant they are used as management's &quot;front line&quot; in 

anti-organizing efforts.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Require the National Labor Relations Board to hold an 

election to determine representation; prior to Taft Hartley, the 

Board at its discretion could certify unions through other means, 

potentially including card-checks.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Authorize states to adopt misnamed &quot;right-to-work&quot; laws, 

barring union security clauses. Union security clauses mean all 

workers in a unionized shop who receive the economic benefits of 

union representation pay dues to share the cost of maintaining the 

union (though they do not have to be members and cannot be 

compelled to support political positions they oppose). As Professor 

Stephen Abraham has noted, &quot;Many ... studies find that 

right-to-work laws have a negative effect on the unionization in 

the states possessing them; the studies also suggest that 

right-to-work laws negatively impact on state wage levels. These 

studies generally conclude that the statistics cited demonstrate 

that right-to-work laws reduce unionizations by increasing union 

organizing and maintenance costs given the existence of 'free 

riders' in the bargaining unit, and/or decrease the bargaining 

power of unions&quot; (Steven Abraham, &quot;How the Taft-Hartley Act 

Hindered Unions,&quot; Hofstra Labor Law Journal, Fall 1994 (Vol. 12, 

No. 1, pp. 1-37)).</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Permit decertification elections -- enabling employers to 

maintain ongoing campaigns against unions' very existence. </font>

</li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strong, vibrant and democratic unions are essential to advance 

workplace safety, to ensure decent conditions of work, to restrain 

corporate employers' exploitative instincts and more broadly to 

ensure a functioning and flourishing democracy. Unfortunately, 

union representation and labor power have steadily declined over 

the last four decades -- with unions now representing only 

approximately 10 percent of the private workforce, the lowest 

percentage in 60 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More or more workers are toiling in jobs near the minimum wage, 

in non-unionized operations like Wal-Mart, K-Mart and McDonald's. 

These service sector jobs are not inherently low-wage. They are low 

wage because they are non-union. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exacerbating the situation of low-wage workers, the minimum wage 

has failed to keep pace with inflation. The present $5.15 minimum 

wage represents more than $2.00 less in real, inflation-adjusted 

purchasing power than the minimum wage of 1968. (According to the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Institute for Policy Studies, if the minimum wage, which stood 

at $3.80 an hour in 1990, had grown at the same rate as CEO 

pay over the decade, it would now be $25.50 an hour, rather 

than the current $5.15 an hour.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decline in union representation is due to many factors -- 

including unencumbered corporate globalization -- but high among 

them is Taft-Hartley and our system of inadequate legal protections 

for workers. Other industrialized countries with more substantial 

legal protections for workers -- such as Canada and countries 

throughout Western Europe -- evidence much higher rates of union 

membership. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before its 55th anniversary next year, the Taft-Hartley blemish 

should be removed from our laws. Doing so would truly honor 

American workers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The large unions in this country need to start a major campaign 

to repeal Taft-Hartley and get their friends in the Democratic 

Party in Congress on board. </font></p>
