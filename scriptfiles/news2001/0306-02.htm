- March 6 -  Congressman Major Owens (Brooklyn, 11th District) 

was interrupted without warning and pulled off the air today when 

he called in as a guest on Pacifica radio station WBAI (99.5 FM). 

Speaking on “Building Bridges: Your Community and Labor 

Report,” Owens was several minutes into a discussion on recent 

changes at the listener-sponsored station when WBAI’s interim 

general manager Utrice Leid came into the master control studio 

and seized the mic.  



<p>Leid then told listeners that the information broadcast by co-host 

Ken Nash and Congressman Owens was untrue.  Later, 

Congressman Owens said he was "outraged, and caught without 

any explanation or apology."  He said he was hoping to talk about 

independent media when the interim general manager took control.  

"I intend to make the statement I was going to make today on 

WBAI, on the floor of the House of Representatives and put it into 

the congressional record,” Owens stated.  



<p>Owens, who has been an outspoken critic of what is now dubbed 

the “Christmas Coup” at WBAI,  said he was “amazed” by today’s 

on-air events. “It’s like something in a totalitarian country with the 

fuhrer intervening,” Owens added.  



<p>According to Nash, Leid came into the master studio 

unexpectedly.  “She tried to talk to my guest without warning or 

invitation,” he said. “I reminded her that the producer is in charge of 

the program. I asked her to leave the studio. Leid then permanently 

cancelled the program.”  “Building Bridges” is WBAI’s only labor 

show.  



<p>The 52-year-old listener-sponsored Pacifica radio network has been 

embroiled in censorship battles in recent years. The Washington 

Post has described Pacifica management’s actions as "cowardly 

radio" and "Soviet-style journalism,” while dozens of journalists 

from around the world struck the Pacifica Network News one year 

ago to protest rampant censorship.  



<p>The late-December, midnight take-over of WBAI by the parent 

foundation created a storm of controversy. Locks were changed, 

veteran staffers were fired and banned and security guards have 

been installed at the station.  A gag rule has been imposed, and 

access to the station is restricted.  Critics say the New York take-

over represents Pacifica management’s continuing effort to alter the 

political content of the entire network.
