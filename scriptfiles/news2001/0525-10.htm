- May 25 - The tax cut that is expected to pass on Saturday will have a detrimental impact on women and their families, but the retention of 

a Senate-passed provision to make the child tax credit partially 

refundable -- making the tax credit available to millions of working 

families for the first time -- would do more to help low-income 

families enter and remain in the middle class than any other part of 

the tax plan, according to the National Women's Law Center. This 

provision is currently one of the few remaining issues holding up the 

agreement of House and Senate conferees on the tax bill. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The size of this tax cut is still too costly, too risky and poses 

a serious threat to Social Security, Medicare and other safety net 

programs on which women and their families disproportionately depend 

-- all for the benefit of a tiny handful of the wealthiest 

taxpayers,&quot; said Nancy Duff Campbell, NWLC co-president. &quot;It is 

essential that the provision making the child tax credit refundable 

survives in the tax plan. It is one of the few benefits for 

low-income families that exists in a tax plan which, as a whole, does very little for them.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campbell explained that the provision making the child tax credit 

refundable will allow over 7 million families with over 15 million 

children to receive some of the child tax credit as a refund, all of 

whom would otherwise receive no benefit from the doubling of the 

child tax credit alone, another feature of the tax plan which is 

expected to pass. </font></p>

For All Coalition, an unprecedented coalition of more than 500 

organizations nationwide working to reduce the size and improve the 

distribution of the Bush tax plan. </font></p>
