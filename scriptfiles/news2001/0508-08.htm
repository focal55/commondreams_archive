- The growth of a global

movement to end abusive child labor has been "virtually

unprecedented in its pace and intensity," according to Frans

Roselaers, Director of the International Program on the Elimination

of Child Labor (IPEC), based in Geneva.

<p>Every segment of society is involved, and the movement's

expansion in recent years has gone beyond political boundaries,

languages, cultures and spiritual traditions, Roselaers will tell

a forum on Capitol Hill on May 10.

<p>"On-the-ground efforts to prevent children from going into child

labor-and to remove children already caught up in this scourge-have

doubled, redoubled and doubled again," says Roselaers.

<p>The international official notes that IPEC has gone from just

one donor government and six program countries eight years ago, to

25 donors providing funds for work in 70 countries. At the same

time a wide range of other organizations-government and

non-governmental bodies-have "greatly expanded the reach and

effectiveness of their operations in the struggle against child

labor." But, "with tens of millions of children caught up in the

worst forms of child labor, the challenge remains enormous," he

adds.

<p>The U.S. Department of Labor is providing $4.3 million through

the ILO to combat the trafficking of children for labor

exploitation in West and Central Africa. The project, scheduled to

start this month, will provide rehabilitation services and

preventive measures to help an estimated 27,000 child victims of

trafficking and children at risk of being exploited.

<p>IPEC is a technical assistance program of the International

Labor Organization, the United Nations specialized agency on work

where two years ago members adopted an international convention on

the worst forms of child labor, covering all types of slavery,

prostitution, pornography, other illicit activities, and hazardous

work. The United States was the third country to ratify the treaty.

Seventy-two (72) countries have ratified it in the two years since

adoption, a record rate in the ILO's 82-year history.

Frans Roselaers, Director of the International Program on the

Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC), based in Geneva, will be

available for interviews in Washington, DC on May 10, 2001. He will

speak at the Capitol Hill forum "Abusive Child Labor: From

Awareness-Raising to Problem Solving," sponsored by Senator Tom

Harkin. Also available for interviews is IPEC's Director of Policy

Development and Advocacy, Alice Ouedraogo, from the West African

nation of Burkina Faso. An IPEC program starting this month in West

and Central Africa aims to help an estimated 27,000 child victims

of trafficking and children at risk of being exploited.
