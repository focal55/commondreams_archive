Associate professor of political economy at Northwestern University, author of <I>Power in

Motion: Capital Mobility and the Indonesian State</I> and co-author of the

forthcoming <I>Reinventing the World Bank,</I> Winters said today:

"Hardly anything has been accomplished at past Asia Pacific Economic

Cooperation summit meetings and very little economics will be discussed at this

one. It is mainly an opportunity for Bush to pressure Asian leaders on the U.S.

military campaign as well as for some of them to strengthen their opposition to

it, which is greater than has been reported. Bush may attempt to buy support,

including ironically by resuming arms shipments to the Indonesian military

which terrorizes its own people."

Author of <I>Red Cat, White Cat: China and the Contradictions of "Market Socialism,"</I> Weil said today: "China is being very foolish and shortsighted in its lending

general support to the U.S. war in Afghanistan. The reason for that Chinese

government policy -- at least in part -- is its conflict with separatist Muslim

forces in its own northwest. But the record shows that the U.S. government uses

such situations only for its immediate goals and then quickly reverses its

stand once it has accomplished its own purposes. In the meantime, the Chinese

government will have opened the door for a U.S. presence in Central Asia and

for U.S. intervention wherever it chooses in the world. This cannot be in the

long-term interest of China or any other nation."

Lobel is professor of constitutional and international law at the University of Pittsburgh. Ratner is vice president of the Center for Constitutional Rights. They co-wrote the

recent article "An Alternative to the U.S. Employment of Military

Force." They said today: "The U.S. has not gotten approval for the

bombing of Afghanistan from the UN Security Council. Just as many predicted,

the U.S. bombing is destabilizing Pakistan, killing more innocents, creating

massive numbers of refugees who are facing starvation and further fueling

resentment towards the U.S. -- thus virtually assuring more terrorism against

us. On totally pragmatic grounds, Americans should be terrified at what our

government is doing. The evidence that Blair put forward against bin Laden is

circumstantial. What's the downside to pausing the bombing and negotiating --

the Taliban have put forward proposals for turning over bin Laden -- while

letting the humanitarian organizations feed some people?"

LamisAndoni@yahoo.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.meionline.com" target="_new">www.meionline.com</A><BR>

An independent journalist and Middle East analyst, Andoni has been monitoring the Al-Jazeera [<A HREF="http://www.aljazeera.net" target="_new">www.aljazeera.net</A>] network. She said

today: "Al-Jazeera shows critical views, including persecuted opposition

groups and intellectuals as well as the pro-U.S. views of most of the

governments, along with the statements of U.S. government officials. Other

perspectives are needed -- there are positions besides being for Bush or being

for bin Laden. Al-Jazeera features news from people in Afghanistan and

Pakistan, it still has a correspondent in Kabul, regular news from the occupied

Palestinian territories, serious discussion of international law, definitions

of terrorism and critical reports on Arab governments."
