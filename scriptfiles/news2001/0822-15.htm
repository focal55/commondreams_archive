<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOSTON - August 22 - Evoking memories of the deficit-inducing 1981 Reagan tax cut 20 years ago

this month, the White House today released surplus projections showing that

its $1.35 trillion tax cut risks unnecessary deficits and squanders a chance

to fund unmet social needs.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By using dubious accounting tricks and over-optimistic economic growth

projections, the Office of Management and Budget predicted that Fiscal Year

2001 will end with a $158 billion surplus, only $1 billion of it outside the

Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Next Tuesday, the Congressional

Budget Office will almost certainly come up with a much smaller number.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Would the Bush tax cut have passed Congress knowing what we know now, just

three months later?,&quot; asks Chuck Collins, program director for United for a

Fair Economy (UFE). &quot;It&sup1;s not too late to scale it back. Support is growing

for repealing the most expensive and unfair parts of the tax cut, such as

the top rate reduction and the estate tax repeal.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These budget numbers are a dramatic change from the White House&sup1;s forecast

in April (not coincidentally, during the tax cut debate) that the government

would take in $281 billion more than it would spend this fiscal year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The real test of integrity comes in someone&sup1;s actions after they make a

mistake. President Bush should stop the shell game and admit his tax cut was

too big,&quot; says Betsy Leondar-Wright, UFE&sup1;s Communications Director. &quot;My

father&sup1;s nursing home is paid for in part by Medicare; my family shouldn&sup1;t

have to worry about who will care for him if President Bush&sup1;s reckless

actions jeopardize Medicare benefits.&quot;

 

Other analysts project a much greater deficit, such as the half a trillion

dollar deficit over 10 years forecast by the Concord Coalition. According to

the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, scaling back the Bush tax cut by

just 40% could eliminate the entire long-term deficit in Social Security.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To date, almost 1,400 people have signed United for a Fair Economy&sup1;s on-line

petition against the tax cut at <a href="http://www.RejectTheRebate.com" target="_new">RejectTheRebate.com</a>, donating over $180,000

from their rebates to tax fairness and other causes. The numbers of rebate

rejecters grows daily as more rebates arrive and the surplus news worsens.
