- July 17 - A coalition of consumer,

public health and environmental groups, as well as scientists and

private citizens requested today that the EPA refrain from

approving StarLink genetically engineered corn for human

consumption until a proper investigation of StarLink is completed.

At the same time and location, the EPA convened the first day of a

two-day Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) meeting to consider whether

to approve StarLink corn for human consumption, the third panel of

this kind.

<p>Months ago, the panel requested that the government conduct

studies on the public health impacts of StarLink corn. Most of this

information has not been supplied. Though the panel still does not

have the evidence it has requested in order to make an informed

recommendation on StarLink, EPA is considering approval of

StarLink-tainted food on supermarket shelves. The groups said today

that the EPA should take no action on StarLink until the proper

data is provided and urged the panel not to recommend an approval

of StarLink.

<p>"We are urging the EPA not to make a decision on StarLink until

it gets the evidence originally requested by its scientific

advisors," said Bill Freese, Senior Policy Analyst at Friends of

the Earth, a member group of the Genetically Engineered Food Alert

coalition. "With the investigation of white corn contamination

incomplete and new reports of allergic reactions, we believe the

EPA cannot legally approve StarLink corn for human consumption."

<p>Genetically Engineered Food Alert released a checklist of

specific studies that the panel requested over the past two years,

but have not been completed. This critical missing information

includes:

<p>-- A thorough allergenicity study, which would include tests on

children and others who may be at high-risk for food allergies;

<p>-- Monitoring the medical community for reports of allergic

reactions to StarLink;

<p>-- Submission of important case studies of people who may be

allergic to StarLink from industry, which the EPA have requested

from them and not yet received; and

<p>-- More accurate allergy tests using Cry9c protein from StarLink

corn, not from bacteria

<p>Genetically Engineered Food Alert also outlined today what a

proper investigation of StarLink should look like. They highlighted

that an investigation should include a thorough study into the

degree of StarLink contamination (including white corn), an

estimation of the size of the population exposed to StarLink,

development of a more reliable allergy test and a prospective study

on those at high-risk for allergic reactions, including children

and farmworkers.

<p>"Due to the degree of uncertainty at this point, an approval of

StarLink corn would be for the sake of protecting Aventis, the

corn's developer," said Matt Rand, Biotechnology Campaign Manager

for the National Environmental Trust, a member group of the

Genetically Engineered Food Alert coalition. "We are asking the EPA

to protect public health before protecting industry."

<p>The groups also expressed concerns over the recent detection of

StarLink protein in white corn. StarLink traits were originally

genetically engineered into yellow corn that was to be used only

for animal feed and not approved for human consumption. Yellow corn

is mostly limited to processed food and has been under observation

and testing since StarLink contamination came to light in the fall

of 2000. White corn is primarily for human consumption.

<p>FDA's most recent finding of StarLink traits found in white corn

suggests that cross-pollination or co-mingling has taken place with

white corn and StarLink yellow corn. This would mean the amount of

exposure to the Cry9c protein (the suspect protein found in

StarLink) of U.S. citizens is likely greater than originally

thought. According to the StarLink Scientific Advisory Panel,

increased exposure levels translate into an increased risk of

allergy development. (SAP Report No. 2000-06, p. 13)

<p>"Genetically Engineered Food Alert does not believe that the EPA

can find that food containing StarLink has met the legal burden of

a reasonable certainty of no harm," said Freese.

Center for Food Safety, Friends of the Earth, Institute for

Agriculture and Trade Policy, National Environmental Trust, Organic

Consumers Association, Pesticide Action Network North America, and

the State Public Interest Research Groups.

</i>

<p><i>Genetically Engineered Food Alert, a coalition of health,

consumer and environmental groups, supports the removal of

genetically engineered ingredients from grocery store shelves

unless they are adequately safety tested and labeled. The campaign

provides web-based opportunities for individuals to express concern

about genetically engineered food and fact sheets on health,

environmental and economic information about genetically engineered

food. The campaign is endorsed by more than 250 scientists,

religious leaders, doctors, chefs, environmental and health

leaders, as well as farm groups </i>
