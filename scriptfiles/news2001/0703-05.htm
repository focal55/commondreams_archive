<div align="center">New Study Finds That Parties' Voter Mobilization Efforts Are Not Dependent on Soft Money<br>

Only 8.3% of Soft Money Spent on 

Party Building, GOTV, and Voter Education</font></div>

- July 3 - With Congress turning again to campaign finance

reform, new research findings from the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU

School of Law reveal that a ban on unregulated soft money will do little

to affect voter mobilization efforts.&nbsp; Based on FEC data, in the

2000 campaign just 8.3% of soft money spent by the Republican and

Democratic parties went to voter education, phone banks, voter

registration, get-out-the-vote drives (“GOTV”) and other traditional

party-building activities.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

The soft money ban is at the heart of the McCain-Feingold bill and

companion legislation sponsored in the House by Representatives Marty

Meehan and Chris Shays.<br>

<br>

<x-tab></x-tab>“Like so

many other scare tactics used by anti-reformers, the recently professed

concern that a soft money ban will gut party spending on voter

mobilization is belied by the facts.” said Nancy Northup, Director of the

Democracy Program at the Brennan Center.&nbsp; “The parties are spending

only about eight cents of every soft money dollar on party building

activities.&nbsp; Parties can raise the money to fund those activities

under the current contribution limits to party committees without taking

soft money from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals.&nbsp;

Banning soft money is a ‘win-win’ situation for political parties and

average Americans.”<br>

<br>

The Brennan Center database on “soft money” spending by the parties was

developed by Craig Holman, Senior Policy Analyst at the Brennan Center,

in consultation with Robert Biersack, Senior Analyst with the Federal

Election Commission.&nbsp; The Brennan Center “soft money” database

consists of all national and state party soft money spending in relation

to federal elections for the 2000 election cycle.&nbsp; The longitudinal

analysis referenced here is made possible through the use of comparable

research by Ray La Raja at the University of California/Berkeley for the

years 1992 through 1998.&nbsp; <br>

As state party coffers have been flooded with soft money since 1996,

state party spending on voter mobilization has changed little.&nbsp;

Moreover, the Brennan Center study suggest that parties could fund their

voter mobilization efforts with hard money, since 40% of soft money

contributions are in amounts permissible for hard money contributions to

party committees.<br>

<br>

The Brennan Center study found that 38% of soft money spent by the

parties in 2000&nbsp; far and away the largest expenditure&nbsp; went to

television and radio ads and direct mail.&nbsp; An earlier study of party

television advertisements by researchers at the Brennan Center and the

University of Wisconsin, showed that party-sponsored television ads

funded with soft money virtually always mentioned candidates (99.8% of

ads) and rarely mentioned the party (8% of ads).&nbsp; Although these ads

were funding with soft money from corporations and unions who are barred

from influencing federal elections, these party-sponsored ads were, in

fact, aimed at electing or defeating candidates.&nbsp; And in the last

two months of election season, a majority of television ads (54%)

purchased with party soft money attacked an opposing candidate.<br>

Party building activities ranked fifth in party soft money spending in

2000:<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><x-tab></x-tab>The

Brennan Center study also found that the recent explosion of soft money

has coincided with a smaller share of party resources being devoted to

party building and a far, far heavier concentration on electioneering

“issue” ads. In two presidential election cycles, from 1992 to

2000, soft money spending by the parties increased over 500 percent, from

$86.1 million to $487.5 million.&nbsp; Over that same period, state party

spending on party building declined from 14% to 10% of soft money

expenditures; while state party spending on electioneering “issue”

advocacy skyrocketed from 3% to 52%.<br>

<br>

<x-tab>&nbsp;</x-tab>“Soft

money ushered in the era of political party as TV ad producer,” said Ms.

Northup.&nbsp; “Closing the soft money loophole will refocus parties on

the activities for which they are uniquely equipped&nbsp; voter

registration and get-out-the-vote drives, broad message development and

agenda setting.”<br>

<br>

<x-tab></x-tab>In a

related finding, the Brennan Center study determined that business, with

$230 million in soft money donations to the parties in 2000, and wealthy

individuals, with $170 million in soft money donations, were largely

responsible for feeding the parties’ explosive demand for soft

money.&nbsp; By comparison, organized labor gave $30 million in soft

money to the parties in 2000.<br>

<br>

The Brennan Center soft money data base coded, by type of expenditure,

the self-reported itemized expenditures made by party committees.&nbsp;

These expenditure types included seven categories:&nbsp; <i>media-issue

advocacy</i> (television and radio buys and production, and any direct

mail and mail production designated for issue advocacy); <i>general

mail</i> (other mail expenditures not designated for issue advocacy);

<i>voter mobilization</i> (all GOTV expenditures, telephone banks, phone

expenses associated with GOTV, voter registration activities, absentee

mail drives, lawn signs and any other expense associated with voter

drives); <i>consultants</i> (outside consultants, lawyers and

accountants); <i>party salaries</i> (wages, salaries, benefits and other

employment-related expenses of party staff); <i>administration</i>

(operations and overhead); and <i>fundraising</i> (all expenses directly

associated with fundraising).<x-tab></x-tab></font></font>
