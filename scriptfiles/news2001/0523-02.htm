At the signing, Greenpeace vowed to hold the Bush Administration to its pledge to work for rapid ratification and implementation.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Greenpeace welcomes the signing of this momentous treaty by the U.S.,&quot; said Rick Hind of Greenpeace. &quot;We now turn our attention to ensuring that President Bush honors his pledge to achieve ratification this year in the U.S. Senate and initiate a rapid implementation by the EPA.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter today to EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who was the head of the U.S. delegation, Greenpeace issued a new challenge to the U.S. to &quot;commit to eliminating all POPs within 25 years.&quot; The letter stated that this is &quot;in keeping with current U.S. plans for full and rapid implementation of the treaty,&#148; and President Bush&#146;s own statement on April 19th to work &quot;without delay.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This treaty provides the tools to achieve the elimination of dioxin, one of the most toxic substances on earth,&quot; continued Mr. Hind. &quot;As we learned from removing lead in gasoline, pollutants in the environment are eliminated only when that is the clear goal of our policies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the initial list of the 12 chemicals targeted for elimination, dioxins will require the most policing of industrialized countries such as the U.S. Dioxins are by-products of most industrial processes involving chlorine. The making of vinyl plastics (PVC) and the use of incineration to burn wastes are among the largest sources of dioxin which has contaminated food, water and the human body on a global scale. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The road to dioxin elimination in the U.S., will be paved with new recycling programs that render municipal waste incinerators obsolete. It will also require the conversion of dirty industries such as PVC plastics to safer materials such vegetable-based plastics. <br>
