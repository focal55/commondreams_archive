- June 12 - The Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade will hold a hearing on Tuesday, June 12, 2001, at 2 p.m. in Room 2128 Rayburn House Office Building, entitled, &#147;FY 2002 Authorization Requests for International Financial</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Institutions, and Activities of the African Development Bank, the World Bank and the IMF in Africa.&#148; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Treasury for International Development, Debt, and Environment Policy William Schuerch will be the only witness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Schuerch is expected to face questions from Members of the Subcommittee concerning the failure of the Treasury Department to comply with Section 596 of Public Law 106-429, which requires the U.S. to oppose any loan agreement or debt relief action at the World Bank or IMF that includes user fees (service charges) on primary health care or education.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Treasury violated the law when it failed to oppose the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for Tanzania in December 2000. As a recent paper from the Center for Economic and Policy Research documents, the PRSP for Tanzania contained user fees on health care, but Treasury did not oppose it. Treasury failed to make any comment on the issue whatsoever when it was discussed in the Board meeting that approved the Tanzania PRSP. Moreover, Treasury failed to report to Congress within 10 days, as the law required, when the Board approved the PRSP for Tanzania including user fees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CEPR study is available at http://www.cepr.net/treasury_tanzania.htm. A printable PDF of the file (for use with Abode Acrobat), is available at: http://www.cepr.net/tanzania.pdf.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Commenting on the upcoming hearing, Naiman said yesterday, &#147;If Congress cannot compel the Treasury Department to comply with a clear, specific, and unambiguous Congressional mandate concerning U.S. policy at the IMF and the World Bank, then talking about &#145;reforming the international financial institutions&#146; is meaningless.&#148;</font></p>
