- February 26 - The Sierra Club called on Congress to reject the energy bill

Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced today, stating the

legislation fails to solve America's energy problems. Instead of setting

America on the path of a sustainable, clean and affordable energy future,

the Sierra Club called the bill a polluter give-away.

<p>

<p>

"Senator Murkowski's bill is a give-away for fossil fuel producers," said

Ann Mesnikoff, the Sierra Club Washington Representative. "All it leaves

for renewable and clean energy are table scraps."

<p>

<p>

"Murkowski isn't introducing an energy bill, he's introducing an energy industry bill," said Melinda Pierce, Sierra Club Senior Washington

Representative. "He wants more mines, more dams, and more drilling.  Trying

to drill our way out of energy problems creates more global warming, more

air pollution and devastates our last wildlands. Given the nation's energy

needs and the public's desire for environmental protection, this bill is

irresponsible."

<p>

Showing that Senator Murkowski's plan is out of step with most Americans,

the Sierra Club cited an Associated Press poll released February 2 that found 53 percent of Americans oppose oil drilling in the Arctic National

Wildlife Refuge, while only 33 percent support such a move.

<p>

<p>

The Murkowski bill masks itself as a response to both California's energy

shortage and the nation's long-term energy needs. In reality, the bill

increases dependence on fossil fuels, worsens air quality, exacerbates

global warming and destroys national treasures such as those found in the

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and western lands--while failing to solve

our nation's energy problems.

<p>

Among the provisions contained in the bill that threaten public health and

degrade our natural resources are those that:

*  Destroy the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. According to an U.S.

Geological Survey estimate the Arctic Refuge would only provide enough oil

for 6-months' worth of American consumption and would take at least 8 years

to come online.  Developing oil in this unique wild area teeming with

wildlife is too high a cost to pay when our energy needs can be fulfilled

in other ways

*  Increase global warming pollution by focusing on the development of oil

and coal that produce the most global warming gases

*  Allow automakers to sell more gas guzzlers by giving them important fuel

economy credits for vehicles which could run on alternative fuel but never

do

*  Restrict the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) and Forest Service's

authority to protect fish and wildlife, water quality, and other

environmental values from oil and gas drilling projects

*  Increase subsidies to coal, oil, gas and nuclear industries

*  Exempt companies using so-called clean coal technologies from complying

with certain Clean Air Act requirements.

<p>

The Sierra Club calls for energy solutions that are clean, green and

long-lasting: increased efficiency, the development of renewable energy,

and the replacement of older power plants with more efficient, less

polluting power plants.

<p>

Forty percent of U.S. oil consumption comes from cars and light trucks.<p>

Raising fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks would save more

oil than we would get from the arctic, off-shore California, and the

Persian Gulf imports combined.

<p>

"The sensible solution is to make cars, SUVs, and light trucks drive

further on a gallon of gas," concluded Mesnikoff. "Boosting fuel economy

will save more oil than we could ever drill in the Arctic Refuge, and we

can start saving sooner. For energy security, and big savings at the gas

pump, we need fuel efficient cars and SUVs. The Murkowski bill runs away

from true efficiency measures and hides in a pool of oil industry

contributions."

<p>

Murkowski's claim that his bill assists California by developing oil is inaccurate. California currently receives less than 1% of its electricity

from oil. Developing oil in the Arctic Refuge will take 8-10 years and will

do nothing to alleviate the current California energy situation.

<p>
