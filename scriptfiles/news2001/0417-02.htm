- April 17 - A new report released

today by the World Resources Institute (WRI) warns that if the

planet's coastal zone continues to be extensively modified or

destroyed, its capacity to provide fish, protect homes and

businesses, reduce pollution and erosion, and sustain biological

diversity will be gravely endangered.

<p>"Unless things change very quickly, the world's coastal areas

face a grim future. Many important coastal habitats like

lagoons, wetlands, mangroves, and coral reefs are disappearing,"

said Jonathan Lash, WRI president, during the release of the

report, Pilot Analysis of Global Ecosystems (PAGE): Coastal

Ecosystems. This report, along with similar studies on

agricultural lands, forests, freshwater, and grasslands,

comprise the first comprehensive analysis of the world's

ecosystems.

<p>Nearly 30 percent of the land area in the world's coastal

ecosystems has already been extensively altered or destroyed by

growing demands for housing, industry and recreation. An

estimated four out of every ten people live within 100

kilometers of a coast. "Coastal populations are exploding, and

as they increase, pressures on coastal ecosystems will follow,"

said Lash.

<p>Nearly two-thirds of all the fish harvested in the world

depend on coastal wetlands, mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral

reefs. About 95 percent of the world's marine fish harvest come

from coastal waters. More low-value fish are being caught today

as stocks of valuable fish like cod, hake, and tuna are

declining. Overall, 75 percent of fish stocks are depleted or

being fished at their biological limit.

<p>The report says that beach erosion is also a growing problem

and affects tourism revenue, especially in island nations. In

the Caribbean, as much as 70 percent of beaches studied over a

ten-year period were eroded. Yet, the long-term success of

tourism in the region is dependent on excellent beaches, a

pristine marine environment, and warm weather.

<p>Studies by the world's climate scientists indicate that an

increase in ocean temperatures could result in rising sea levels

by as much as 95 centimeters at the end of this century. "The

resulting storm surges could intensify erosion, habitat loss,

increased salinity of freshwater aquifers, and extreme coastal

flooding," said Yumiko Kura, one of the lead authors of the

report.

<p>The protection of shorelines, especially in small countries

and countries with limited fertile land, has become particularly

important. In Japan, the government estimates that 46 percent of

its shorelines need protection and has spent more than $40

billion on this effort.

<p>The report also warns that the outright destruction of coral

reefs by destructive fishing practices and mining is a serious

problem. Coral bleaching -- which results from rising ocean

temperatures caused by climate change -- is also increasing and

further threatens this valuable resource.

<p>The Coastal Ecosystems report also reveals:

<p>-- In the last 50 years, as much as 85 percent of the

mangroves have been lost in Thailand, the Philippines, Pakistan,

Panama and Mexico. Globally, about 50 percent of mangrove

forests have been lost.

<p>-- In recent decades, the increase in pollution from inland

sources and the loss of coastal habitats that filter pollution

have led to the expansion of dead or hypoxic zones, such as

those in the Gulf of Mexico.

<p>-- The incidence of harmful algal blooms along the United

States coastlines increased from 200 in the 1970s to 700 in the

1990s. Since 1991, these algal blooms have caused nearly $300

million in terms of fish kills, public health problems, and lost

revenue from tourism.

<p>-- More invasive or alien species are being found in coastal

areas, often disrupting the food chain and eliminating native

species. Scientists estimate that on any given day, as many as

3,000 different species are carried in the ballasts of the

world's ocean fleet. Scientists have identified 480 invasive

species in the Mediterranean, 89 in the Baltic Sea, and 124 in

Australian waters.

<p>"These indicators show that the world's coastal ecosystems are

going down the drain fast. The challenge before us is to find

ways to meet the needs of human development while protecting the

ecosystems that are the foundation of all life," said WRI

president Lash.

environmental think tank that goes beyond research to create

practical ways to protect the Earth and improve people's lives. </i>
