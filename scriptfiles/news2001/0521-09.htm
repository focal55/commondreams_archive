- May 21 - While tens of thousands of AT&amp;T employees have lost their jobs and shareholders have lost their money, AT&amp;T&#146;s leaders have gained millions of dollars. Shareholders will present a resolution at AT&amp;T&#146;s annual meeting on Wednesday, May 23, in Cincinnati, OH, calling on the company to link executive compensation to issues such as declining customer service, public relations controversies, and layoffs.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of particular concern to shareholders is Business Week&#146;s conclusion that during the years 1997-99, AT&amp;T CEO Michael Armstrong was among the lowest 30% of large-company CEO&#146;s in terms of delivering corporate profits relative to the size of his pay package. In 1999, Armstrong&#146;s total compensation was $6.8 million, and $3.8 million in 1998. AT&amp;T showed more prudence in setting executive compensation in 2000 by reducing Armstrong&#146;s pay package.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth supports the restraint shown by AT&amp;T last year in executive pay and would like to see it established as a permanent part of the company&#146;s compensation policy. AT&amp;T shareholder and United for a Fair Economy member Ann Sink, of North Carolina, will present the Responsible Wealth resolution, which is co-sponsored by Walden Asset Management, a Boston-based socially responsible money management company.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AT&amp;T&#146;s customer service quality has declined, reflected in accelerating customer losses in its core long distance business. Consumer boycotts are threatening in response to AT&amp;T&#146;s investment in the pornographic Hot Channel. In addition to thousands of layoffs in the 1990s, AT&amp;T has also alienated long-term management employees by changing the company&#146;s pension plan to reduce the potential benefits for thousands of veteran AT&amp;T staff.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leading companies, such as IBM, Eastman Kodak, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, already include various non-financial and social responsibility factors in the evaluation of executive compensation, similar to those which Responsible Wealth calls for in this resolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth has filed shareholder resolutions related to executive compensation at seven companies: Disney, FleetBoston, Raytheon, Household International, Exxon Mobil and Citigroup, as well as AT&amp;T. Supporting the resolutions is a recent study by Responsible Wealth co-director Scott Klinger which concludes that skyrocketing CEO pay foreshadows poor stock performance. The report and shareholder resolutions can be found at <a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org">www.responsiblewealth.org</a>. </font></p>
