<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">12 Noon: March and Rally: leaves McPherson Square (15th and I  ST. NW)

for rally at the office of US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick (17th and F NW). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

(Washington DC) More than 1000 protesters will converge on the office of the

USTR at 17th and F Streets, NW, on Thursday, April 12, after a short march

leaving at noon from McPherson Square. The protesters will denounce the Bush

Administration&sup1;s secretive negotiation of the Free Trade Area of the

Americas (FTAA) because it will reduce access to affordable generic versions

of essential HIV/AIDS medication, and threaten health care, education, labor

rights and environmental across the Western Hemisphere.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reconstituted Seattle Coalition of activists includes AIDS, labor,

environmentalist, and fair trade organizations. The activists will demand

that the USTR end its push to expand NAFTA to all of the Western Hemisphere.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This trade pact threatens the rights of HIV-positive people in impoverished

nations to obtain the medicine they need to survive. The health and survival

of people in North and South America must be put before the commercial

interests of the pharmaceutical industry,&quot; said John Bell of ACT UP.&quot;NAFTA's legacy of destroying jobs, small businesses and health standards

does not need to be deepened.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activists report that the US negotiating position poses a serious threat

to Brazil&sup1;s acclaimed generic AIDS drug program. Faced with 1.2 million

infections predicted by World Bank epidemiological models, Brazil embarked

in 1997 on an ambitious program to locally manufacture expensive affordable

versions of expensive patented medicines. The competition from generic

medicines brought prices down by over 90% in some cases. The Brazilian

effort now provides free medicine to every region of Brazil, including newly

constructed clinics in very remote areas. Sustainable access to affordable

medicine in Brazil resulted in plummeting rates of death and new infection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a March meeting with ACT UP activists and allies, USTR officials made

clear that the FTAA would provide increased monopoly protection to

pharmaceutical companies, and include provisions restricting the WTO-legal

rights of nations to manufacture or purchase generic versions of expensive

patented drugs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through its generic industry and commitment to affording all its citizens

access to free medication, Brazil has seen its AIDS death rate drop by 52%.&quot;Local generic competition against monopoly holders saved 500,000 lives in

Brazil,&quot; said Straub. &quot;We insist that our government withdraw FTAA

negotiations that increase protections for drug monopolies beyond existing

WTO intellectual property agreements.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FTAA also contains provisions allowing corporations standing to block or

overturn implementation of laws that displease industry. Cases would be

heard within a secret hemispheric tribunal with the power to overrule

sovereign nations .</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The FTAA cedes the sovereignty of nations to corporate interests. If

GlaxoSmithKline doesn&sup1;t like Brazil&sup1;s generic AIDS program, it could seek to

have it suspended,&quot; said ACT UP&sup1;s Jim Straub. &quot;Drug companies are highly

likely to use this provision to limit the ability of poor countries to

obtain and distribute essential AIDS medications.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ambassador Robert Zoellick, the nation&sup1;s cabinet-level trade negotiator,

will be traveling with President Bush to Quebec later by April 20 to

negotiate the terms of the FTAA with 34 other heads of state. The trade and

finance ministers will be met with the largest demonstrations since

activists derailed the WTO's Seattle Round. Over 10 thousand protesters are

planning to lay siege to the closed secret negotiations. The discussions

will occur behind a physical wall surrounding the center of Quebec City, erected for the occasion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brenda Wheeler of ACT UP states, &quot;We are throwing a going away party for the

trade negotiators as they prepare for the negotiations in Quebec City on

April 20. Robert Zoellick can be certain to find thousands of people with

AIDS and their allies in his face until he takes every possible step to

protect poor countries efforts to increase access to medicine.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

ACT UP demands: <br>

1. No patent provisions within the FTAA or other bilateral trade

negotiations. The WTO TRIPS agreement is more than enough. The FTAA contains

unacceptable patent requirements in excess of WTO agreements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. No government-level standing for corporations to interfere with the laws

and regulations of sovereign nations. The FTAA&sup1;s investment provisions give

corporations such as drug companies the rights to sue governments to prevent

implementation of any regulation that displeases the industry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. A removal of provisions that promote the privatization of vital public

services, including healthcare and education.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. An end to secret trade negotiations amounting to end runs around WTO

rules. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACT UP Philadelphia is the nation&sup1;s largest chapter of the direct action

AIDS activist group, and has been at the heart of international campaigns to

increase access to affordable medicines in poor countries being obliterated

by HIV. </font></p>
