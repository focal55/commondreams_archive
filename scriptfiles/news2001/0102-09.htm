- January 2 - Mississippi Gay Lobby (MGL) will begin 

running television advertisements through cable 

advertising firms throughout the state.  The test run will 

begin in the Jackson metro area through Lovecomm 

Advertising Sales.  Customers who have Time-Warner 

Cable or Susquehanna (SusCom) Cable, which equals to 

approximately 95,200 cable subscribers, will be able to 

view the advertisements on MTV and VH-1.  After the 

test run, and providing expected results are met, a full 

Lovecomm systemwide run, including the addition of CNN 

and Lifetime to the channels the advertisement will be run 

on, will commence in the rest of the state for which 

Lovecomm handles cable advertising.  This full Lovecomm 

systemwide run will ultimately reach into 129,580 homes 

that subscribe to cable television.  In addition to the full 

Lovecomm systemwide run, other cable advertising 

systems in the state will be contacted and providing 

cooperation and acceptable negotiations, the 

advertisements will run on them as well, giving full 

statewide coverage and increasing the number of homes 

that the MGL advertisement will reach, to approximately 

650,000.



<p>"Indeed, this is a first in Mississippi.  For the Mississippi 

gay community and for a Mississippi gay equality 

organization, to be promoted on television within the 

state, is extraordinary progress.  Before we even 

imagined that this could possibly happen, and knowing 

the hostile environment against homosexuals in 

Mississippi, we first asked, out of respect, all of the 

companies involved in this undertaking as to whether or 

not they had a problem with us running advertisements.  

Lovecomm, the firm that is producing the spot and is 

responsible for its actual placement into rotation, as well 

as the cable companies who will be airing the spot, Time-

Warner and Susquehanna, all said they saw no problem.  

We of course applaud these companies for being open to 

progress and being a part of breaking down the 

homophobic barriers in Mississippi.," said MGL Chairman 

Jody Renaldo. "It has been a pleasure working with 

Lovecomm, to make this happen.  The initial meeting was 

a rather productive and fun one, as myself and Lovecomm 

executives not only discussed the actual television spot, 

but the gay community as well, from "gay slang" to the 

current state of affairs in the gay community.  Lovecomm 

executives have been very upfront with us about any 

issues that came about.  There was an instance where 

the ideas for the spot were given to a Lovecomm 

employee so that he could put together the script for the 

spot.  He refused to work on our project because of us 

being a gay organization.  We respect that and have no 

problems with it.  Not everyone is for us, and then again, 

not everyone is against us.  If everyone was for us, we 

wouldn't need to exist." 



<p>Renaldo said that the intent of the television 

advertisements, is to begin much needed education about 

the gay community, for Mississippi residents.  Renaldo 

also said the advertisements will promote the fact that an 

actual active gay equality organization does exist in 

Mississippi and will signify to the gay community in the 

state, that there is someone out there working for their 

equality.  "Almost a year into this organization, we have 

found that alot of gay and gay friendly Mississippians 

don't even know we exist.  This will get the word out, 

and in turn, our membership and lobbying power will go 

up.  2001 will be an exciting year for us and we hope that 

for whatever reasons, our community does not grow 

complacent and stale.  We have some serious battles 

ahead what with the outcome of the recent elections.  

The problem isn't Washington, nor Hollywood.  The 

problem is a weak, divided, complacent GLBT community 

and it is time for us to come together and make some 

noise and turn some heads.  The days of being who we 

are as long as noone else knows or sees it, should come 

to an end and we feel this is a great step in making that 

happen."



<p>Renaldo went on to say that the GLBT and GLBT friendly 

community of Mississippi, is encouraged to get involved in 

this project.  "This is not a cheap undertaking at all.  It's 

not as expensive as we thought it would be, but by no 

means is it cheap.  What we would like to see happen, is 

the spots run in our initial proposal which is 132 spots a 

month, 20 of those 132 spots to run at our discretion 

such as in cases of special programs that come on at 

particular times throughout the year on these channels.  

For us to do this, it will cost $3040.00 each month.  We 

could indeed use any underwriting, donations, grants, and 

memberships to fund this project.  We, of course, 

encourage the Mississippi GLBT and GLBT friendly 

community to stand up and help us make this happen.  

The advertisement will be available soon on our web site, 

for anyone to view."



<p><i>Mississippi Gay Lobby was formed in March of 2000. MGL 

exists to educate gay Mississippians about their 

community, its history, and about issues of relevance to 

them. The organization also exists to educate the general 

public about the Mississippi gay community. Beyond this, 

Mississippi Gay Lobby works to advance the cause of full 

equality and civil rights for all members of the Mississippi 

gay community. MGL operates a web site at
