- September 27 - Some family members of the victims killed in the September 11 attacks are speaking out in

opposition to the administration's apparent military plans. Judy Keane, who

lost her husband Richard, said: "Bombing Afghanistan is just going to

create more widows, more homeless, fatherless children." [CNN, 9/25; see

Jill Gartenberg, whose husband Jim was killed, said that "we don't win by

killing other people." [Fox, 9/24] Amber Amundson lost her husband, Craig,

in the Pentagon. She wrote in the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> [9/25, <A HREF="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0925-06.htm">www.commondreams.org/views01/0925-06.htm</A>]

"If you choose to respond to this incomprehensible brutality by

perpetuating violence against other innocent human beings, you may not do so in

the name of justice for my husband." Gavin Cushny's brother Rupert

Eales-White stated, "If military action results in the deaths of innocent

Afghans then 100 more Bin Ladens will rise from the grave." [<I>The Independent</I>,

They said: "Our son Greg is among the many missing from the World Trade Center attack. We

cannot pay attention to the daily flow of news about this disaster. But we read

enough of the news to sense that our government is heading in the direction of

violent revenge, with the prospect of sons, daughters, parents, friends in

distant lands dying, suffering, and nursing further grievances against us. It

is not the way to go. It will not avenge our son's death. Not in our son's

name. Our son died a victim of an inhuman ideology. Our actions should not

serve the same purpose. Let us grieve. Let us reflect and pray. Let us think

about a rational response that brings real peace and justice to our

world."

In his speech at the National Cathedral memorial service, President Bush praised an unnamed man "who could have saved himself" but instead "stayed until the end

and at the side of his quadriplegic friend." Lasar said today: "That

man was my uncle, Abe Zelmanowitz. When the first airplane struck, Abe could

not bear to abandon his wheelchair-using colleague, and called his family to

say so. Despite their pleading, he insisted that he would stay. They have been

missing ever since. My mother, who lives 20 minutes from the WTC, is in a state

of shock. I mourn the death of my uncle, and I want his murderers brought to

justice. But I am not making this statement to demand bloody vengeance. A

senator from my state, Dianne Feinstein, said: 'U.S. must spare no effort to

uncover, ferret out and destroy those: who commit acts of terrorism; who

provide training camps; who shelter; who finance; and who support terrorists.

Whether that entity is a state or an organization, those who harbor them, arm

them, train them and permit them must, in my view, be destroyed.' How does one

destroy states? Through the covert subversion of their societies? Through

carpet bombing? Afghanistan has more than a million homeless refugees. A U.S.

military intervention could result in the starvation of tens of thousands of

people. What I see coming are actions and policies that will cost many more

innocent lives, and breed more terrorism, not less. I do not feel that my

uncle's compassionate, heroic sacrifice will be honored by what the U.S.

appears poised to do."
