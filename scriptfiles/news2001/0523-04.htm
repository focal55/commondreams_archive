- May 23 - Responding to the pressing needs of millions of American seniors for a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit, U.S. Senator Paul

Wellstone (D-MN) today introduced The Medicare Extension of Drugs to Seniors

(MEDS) Act of 2001 (S. 925), comprehensive legislation that synthesizes the best

and most innovative policy ideas from the debate surrounding the prescription

drug benefit issue.   The bill addresses the twin problems of affordable

prescription drug coverage for millions of America&#146;s senior citizens,  and

inflated U.S. prices for medications.  Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has introduced

companion legislation in the House, and the bill has been endorsed by the

congressional Progressive Caucus.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is time to make prescription drugs affordable for America&#146;s senior citizens,

millions of whom live on fixed incomes while the cost of often life-saving drugs

skyrockets year after year.  President Bush&#146;s proposal fails to get us there. 

MEDS will cover all seniors on Medicare, is affordable and safe, and has strong

cost containment measures.  This is a real prescription drug benefit, the one

America&#146;s seniors deserve, and a big improvement over what the Administration

has offered seniors,&#148; said Wellstone. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast to the Bush plan unveiled in January, which only covers seniors who

make less than $15,000,  the Wellstone package covers all Medicare

beneficiaries, would pay for 80% of a senior&#146;s drug costs, and at a comparable

price to the federal government. Unlike the Bush proposal which seeks to throw

billions of dollars of taxpayer money at the pharmaceutical industry without

regard to the overall price of prescription drugs, the Wellstone plan employs

common-sense cost-containment measures such as:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Volume Pricing Discounts which allow seniors to purchase their prescription

drugs at the best price that the federal government pays when it purchases

medications for VA Hospitals and Medicaid.

Reasonable Pricing Agreements when NIH enters into agreements with commercial

drug companies to bring NIH-researched drugs to market.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Closing Loopholes in the Prescription Drug Importation Act</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Minnesota,  65 percent of seniors have no prescription drug coverage;  twice

the national average.  Over half of the seniors in the U.S. have either no

prescription drug coverage or totally inadequate coverage.  The time has come to

enact a comprehensive, affordable, 20-percent co-pay, $2000-cap, prescription

drug benefit for all seniors - a plan that does not favor the health insurance

or pharmaceutical industries over our own parents and grandparents. The MEDS Act

provides such a benefit.                        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUMMARY<br>

THE MEDICARE EXTENSION OF DRUGS TO SENIORS ACT (MEDS), S. 925<br>

Overview:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MEDS establishes an 80/20 outpatient prescription drug benefit under a new

Medicare Part D that will be administered by the Health Care Financing

Administration.  The plan will cost similar to figures for the Bush prescription

drug plan due to this plan&#146;s emphasis on lowering the price of pharmaceuticals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coverage:  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&times;   First_dollar 80%/20% benefit (may charge beneficiary less for generics)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&times;   Catastrophic coverage begins at $2000 out_of_pocket.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&times;   No beneficiary would have to spend more than $2288 for prescription drugs

(including premium)<br>

    <br>

Prescription Drug Prices: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&times;   (Reimportation) Beginning 2003, all FDA_approved prescription drugs would be allowed for importation at world market prices after being tested for safety.

Once fully implemented, Medicare could set fee schedules based on imported drug

prices. <br>

 &times;  (Allen Bill) To eliminate price discrimination, manufacturers would charge

<br>

Medicare and its beneficiaries the price equal to the lower of either the lowest

price paid for the drug by other Federal Government agencies or the

manufacturer's best price for the drug. <br>

 &times;  (Reasonable Prices) Drugs developed with taxpayer funds would be subject to&quot;reasonable price&quot; agreements when patents are transferred to pharmaceutical

companies.<br>

 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Premiums and Low_income Assistance: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Premiums would be $24/month in the first year and indexed to a pharmaceutical

Sustainable Growth Rate, which will ensure that premiums or drug costs do not

increase arbitrarily.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government would subsidize low_income beneficiaries to the following levels:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">- 100% of the premium and cost sharing for beneficiaries below 135% of poverty. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">_ Partial subsidy on a sliding scale for those between 135% and 150%</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employer Incentive Program: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employers providing drug coverage equal to or better than the Medicare coverage

receive an incentive payment to maintain such coverage. </font></p>
