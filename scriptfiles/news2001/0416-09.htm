- April 16 - American Forests

(<a href="http://www.americanforests.org">americanforests.org</a>)

is in the home stretch of its "A Million

Trees for Earth Day" campaign, which urges people everywhere to

help plant a million trees for Earth Day, April 22. Whether they

plant trees in their yards or communities, or in one of American

Forests' Global ReLeaf ecosystem restoration projects, the

organization is encouraging everyone to do something good for

the planet on Earth Day. The "Million Trees" campaign runs from

March 1 - May 1.

<p>"The Internet gives people the power to take a direct action

this Earth Day that will literally last a lifetime," said

Deborah Gangloff, executive director of American Forests. "The

simple act of planting 10, 25, or 100 Global ReLeaf trees allows

anyone to make real and measurable impacts on environmental

concerns ranging from global warming, to the loss of wildlife

habitat, to air and water pollution."

<p>The public can plant Global ReLeaf trees through American

Forests' website, <a href="http://www.americanforests.org">www.americanforests.org</a>.

Every $1 donated

plants one native tree in an ecosystem restoration project.

Trees can also be planted by calling 1-800-545-TREE, or by mail

at American Forests, PO Box 2000, Washington, DC, 20013.

<p>From helping to regenerate forests burned by wildfire in

California to planting trees in war-torn Sarajevo, to restoring

habitat for Siberian tigers in the Russian Far East, American

Forests is mobilizing people and organizations of all kinds to

improve local and global conditions for generations to come.

<p>Students in hundreds of classrooms are helping to plant

Global ReLeaf trees in conjunction with American Forests'

environmental education program, A Tree for Every Child. Schools

that plant 100 trees in Global ReLeaf restoration projects

receive an American Forests Famous &amp; Historic Tree to plant at

their school or in the community. The public can also order

Famous &amp; Historic Trees to plant at home for Earth Day.

<p>Companies and businesses of all sizes are participating in "A

Million Trees for Earth Day." On April 11, 40 students from

Benjamin High School in Los Angeles helped dozens of IKEA

employees plant hundreds of saplings in Angeles National Forest.

The planting of live oak, canyon oak, and holly leaf cherry tree

saplings will help regenerate the forest. Home furnishings

retailer IKEA sponsored the ecosystem restoration project

conducted through American Forests' Wildfire ReLeaf program,

which plants native trees in burned areas.

<p>Thousands of trees are being planted as part of "A Million

Trees for Earth Day" by customers of Eddie Bauer through the

specialty retailer's Add a dollar, Plant a tree spring campaign

at stores, online at <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com">www.eddiebauer.com</a>,

and through its

catalogs.

<p>Home products manufacturer Triangle-Pacific is planting

200,000 trees as part of its support of "A Million Trees for

Earth Day." Shaklee Corporation, which manufactures and

distributes health and wellness products, is encouraging its

500,000 distributors across the United States to plant trees;

Batteries Plus and Anheuser-Busch each are planting 20,000 trees

as well.

<p>At <a href="../\\www.americanforests.org">www.americanforests.org</a>

people will find information

ranging from the best way to plant a tree in their yard to an

easy way to plant trees for Global ReLeaf in one of 50 ecosystem

restoration projects underway this year. Every dollar donated

online plants a native tree and counts toward the million-tree

goal. Individuals can also log in the trees they plant at home

or in community action projects.

<p>Since 1990, American Forests has been planting trees for

Global ReLeaf in areas damaged by human or natural causes.

Global ReLeaf has planted trees in more than 500 projects and

extends through every state and territory in America, as well as

21 countries worldwide. In 1996 the organization set a goal to

plant 20 million trees for the new millennium. To date more than

17 million trees have been planted and American Forests expects

to plant the 20 millionth this fall.

<p>American Forests, founded in 1875, is the oldest national

nonprofit citizen conservation organization. Its three Centers

-- Global ReLeaf, Urban Forest, and Forest Policy -- mobilize

people around the world to improve the environment by planting

and caring for trees. American Forests publishes American

Forests magazine and can be found on the Internet at

<a href="http://www.americanforests.org">www.americanforests.org</a>.
