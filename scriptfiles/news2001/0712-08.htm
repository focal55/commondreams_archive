- July 12 - The Federal Anti-Marriage Amendment, being proposed today by the Alliance for

Marriage, is nothing more than a cold-hearted attempt to make the U.S.

Constitution explicitly anti-lesbian and gay rights. And Congress should not

give it the time of day. 



<p>If Congress considers any change to the Constitution, rather than a divisive

and destructive amendment that would deny certain people an equal right to

marry, why not pass one that will actually do some good? Women and men of this

country would be much better served by an Equal Rights Amendment to guarantee

equality of rights under the law, regardless of sex. 



<p>At a time when women are astronauts and truck drivers, surgeons and CEOs, it's

sometimes hard to remember that the U.S. Constitution still doesn't guarantee

women the same rights as men. Yet, women are paid less on the job and charged

more for everything from dry cleaning to insurance. The value of women's

unpaid

work for their families is not fully taken into account in divorce

settlements,

pension benefits or Social Security. When women turn to the courts to right

these wrongs, they are at a distinct disadvantage in the absence of

constitutional equality. Just this term, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld

discrimination in federal immigration law based on the most blatant of

sex-role

stereotyping about the roles of women and men as parents. 



<p>Lesbians and gays are at even greater political, cultural and legal

disadvantage. A so-called Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress already

prevents the economic and legal benefits of marriage for same-sex couples.

Congress refuses to incorporate sexual orientation in legislation aimed at

preventing hate crimes. Lesbians and gays face discrimination, harassment and

even violence at school and in the workplace. The proposed Federal

Anti-Marriage Amendment would only serve to further disenfranchise the lesbian

and gay community and should be renamed the Sexual Orientation Discrimination

Amendment. 



<p>Congress would do well to uphold the true purpose of the U.S. Constitution by

refusing to adopt an amendment that would move us further way from equality

for

all, and instead working toward passage of an Equal Rights Amendment.
