- July 10 - John Bolton, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control, gave the wrong

speech to the UN small arms conference. The issue is not domestic U.S. gun

control, but rather the transfer of small arms and light weapons across

international borders.  U.S. rhetoric glosses over weaknesses in U.S.

policy while trumpeting dubious accomplishments in several areas, including:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">End-use Monitoring

Rhetoric: &quot;To ensure that arms are delivered to legitimate end-users, our

government rigorously monitors arms transfers, investigating suspicious

activity and acting quickly to curtail exports to those recipients who do

not meet our strict criteria for responsible use.&quot;  - John Bolton</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reality:  In FY 1999 the State Department's Blue Lantern end-use monitoring

program conducted only 360 end-use checks on approximately 45,000 weapons

export licenses valued at $46.8 billion.  Thus, the U.S. conducts end-use

checks on only .8% of its weapons export licenses.  Furthermore, an August

2000 General Accounting Office audit found that &quot;The [Pentagon] has not

effectively implemented the requirement that its field personnel observe

and report on foreign government's use of U.S. defense articles and

services transferred though the Foreign Military Sales Program.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Controls on Arms Brokers

Rhetoric: &quot;Unchecked &quot;rogue&quot; brokers operating with impunity due to a lack

of regulation are a major source of illicitly trafficked arms around the

world. ... The U.S. prides itself as having one of the most comprehensive

regimes governing international arms brokers in the world.&quot;  - Ambassador

Donald J. McConnell, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reality: Under U.S. brokering law, in place since 1996, there has not been

a single prosecution of an arms broker.  According to a recent study by the

Fund for Peace, U.S. brokering regulations are not being vigorously

enforced despite clear evidence of criminal behavior.  Shortfalls include:

&quot;understaffing and inadequate operating procedures, gaps in the exchange of

information among US Government agencies, lack of transparency, enforcement

problems related to extraterritorial jurisdiction and possible invocation

of ignorance of the law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Transparency

Rhetoric: &quot;The [&quot;Section 655 report&quot;] includes detailed information,

compiled on a country-by- country basis, concerning the quantity and value

of defense articles (including firearms and ammunition) properly authorized

for export under the Arms Export Control Act.&quot; - U.S. Department of State

Fact Sheet</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reality: The &#145;655 report' is helpful, but it does not report the quantity

and value of defense articles actually delivered to other countries

pursuant to licenses issued by the State Department, nor the quantity and

value of small arms and light weapons sold by the Pentagon's foreign

military sales program. Moreover, the U.S. Congress is rarely, if ever,

notified of  small arms exports because they do not exceed the $14 million

notification threshold.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the U.S. delegation continues with its reckless and obscure comments

about domestic U.S. gun ownership it will remain part of the scourge of the

global proliferation of small arms and light weapons which are the weapons

of choice in 46 of 49 conflicts since World War II.</font></p>
