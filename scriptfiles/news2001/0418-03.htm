- April 18 - Public Citizen is urging 350 of the largest food companies and

industry groups in the United States and throughout the world to refrain from selling

irradiated food. In <a href="http://www.citizen.org/cmep/rad-food/Lettermailingtoretailers4-01.htm">a letter sent

last week</a> to the companies and organizations, Public Citizen explained that a vast

majority of consumers do not want to eat food that has been exposed to high doses of

radiation and that irradiated food could endanger the health of their customers who eat

it.

<p>In addition to the letter, Public Citizen sent the largest meatpackers, food

processors, retailers, fast-food chains and agribusiness corporations a packet of

information explaining the potential<b> </b>hazards of irradiated food. Companies and

groups receiving the letter ranged from Burger King, Campbell Soup Company, Wal-Mart and

Tyson Foods to the National Chicken Council, the National Restaurant Council and the

National Food Processors Association.</p>



<p>&quot;Consumers do not want to eat filth, whether it&#146;s been irradiated or

not,&quot; said the letter, which was signed by Wenonah Hauter, director of Public

Citizen&#146;s Critical Mass Energy and Environment Program. &quot;Americans demand and

deserve fresh, wholesome, safe food that has been grown and processed in clean

environments. The bottom line is that irradiation will not make food cleaner. It merely

masks unhygienic slaughtering and processing practices, while corrupting nutritional

integrity. . . . We urge your company not to sell irradiated food until the many lingering

public health questions have been adequately addressed.&quot;</p>



<p>Among its many hazards, irradiation can deplete vitamins and nutrients, form new

chemicals that have never been studied for toxicity, and corrupt the flavor and odor of

food. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not properly assess the

safety of irradiated food before legalizing it for human consumption, research by Public

Citizen has found.
