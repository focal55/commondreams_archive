- October 22 - Although TV preacher Jerry Falwell claims to have apologized for his infamous remarks about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, his ministry has sent a fund-raising letter to donors recasting his statements in a positive light and depicting him as a victim of the news media &quot;wolf pack&quot; and &quot;liberal lies.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an Oct. 4 appeal for funds, Jerry Falwell Ministries accuses &quot;liberals, and especially gay activists&quot; of launching &quot;a vicious smear campaign to discredit him.&quot; It says Falwell is &quot;being roundly vilified by the news media for remarks he made in a TV interview while calling for spiritual revival in America.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter, signed by Falwell's son Jonathan, compares Falwell to biblical heroes such as the Prophet Jeremiah and Queen Esther and says, &quot;Liberals of all stripes, especially in the media, have seized on this opportunity to trash dad's deeply held Christian beliefs and to literally attack him day and night.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It seems that Satan has launched a hail of fiery darts at dad recently,&quot; writes Jonathan Falwell. &quot;He needs to know you still support him. Please return the enclosed Vote of Confidence Reply Card right away in the envelope I have provided within the next 5 days&#133;.And with your card, please remember to include a special Vote of Confidence gift for Jerry Falwell of at least $50 or even $100 along with your signed card.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Falwell's critics say the fund-raising letter is a new low.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is truly outrageous,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. &quot;Falwell has gone from apologizing for his hateful remarks to trying to cash in on them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I thought Falwell couldn't sink much lower than he did in his vicious remarks after the Sept. 11 tragedy,&quot; continued Lynn. &quot;But this fund-raising letter is indeed a new low.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Sept. 13, Falwell went on TV preacher Pat Robertson's &quot;700 Club&quot; program to discuss the terrorist attacks. With Robertson's concurrence, Falwell blamed the events on judges who uphold church-state separation, abortion rights activists, gay people, civil liberties activists and others who are &quot;trying to secularize America.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Said Falwell, &quot;I point the finger in their face and say, 'You helped this [the terrorist attack] happen.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When a wave of intense national criticism erupted, Robertson blamed the episode on Falwell. Falwell initially tried to explain away the remarks, saying they were taken out of context. Finally, however, he issued a full apology, going on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; Sept. 20 to admit the tirade was &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;indefensible.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Falwell fund-raising letter says donations to his ministry have plummeted in recent days and claims &quot;we have lost more than $500,000 in income since the terrorist attacks.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It complains that &quot;even some Christian friends have remained silent while dad has faced the media wolf pack alone.&quot;  In a P.S., it concludes, &quot;[P]lease let Jerry Falwell know you don't believe the media distortions being spread about him.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
