- June 13 - Doors will swing wide 

open for Democratic women throughout the District -- many leading 

to promising career opportunities at the 12th annual Women Opening 

Doors for Women, hosted by the Women's Information Network (WIN). 

This unique event provides a forum for recent college graduates, 

newcomers to D.C. and women climbing the ladder of success to network 

and form relationships with mentors and other pro-choice, 

democratic women. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WIN has made great strides in organizing this event to affirm 

its commitment to core democratic principles. In support of the 

organized labor movement, WIN is pleased to hold the opening 

reception at the AFL-CIO headquarters building. Demonstrating its 

steadfast commitment to reproductive choice, the featured speaker, 

Gloria Feldt, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America 

will deliver a timely call to action. At this year's WODW, the many 

accomplishments of Donna Brazile, Campaign Manager, Gore 2000 

Campaign, will be honored with a special recognition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlighting the evening are 25 simultaneous, career-themed 

dinner parties held in the homes of accomplished women in the 

District. Dinner topics this year range in scope from &quot;A Woman's 

Place is in the House &amp; Senate&quot; to &quot;The Art of Money: Non-profit 

Fundraising&quot; to &quot;Web Women, Politics in the 21st Century.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Providing women with a forum to network and learn from other 

women motivates our organization,&quot; said Amy Haberman Gomez, 

President of WIN. &quot;WODW is an inspirational event because it 

brings together women of different social and professional 

backgrounds who have the same political interests. This event 

truly demonstrates the power that we can collectively have as 

women.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Women's Information Network (WIN) is Washington's premier
