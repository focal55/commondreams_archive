- July 16 - Nearly four dozen religious, labor and public policy organizations have sent a joint letter to the U.S. House of Representatives urging members to vote against the Community Solutions Act (H.R. 7), a bill advancing President George W. Bush's &quot;faith-based initiative.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 46 organizations assert that the bill &quot;is an unnecessary proposal that would harm religious liberty, turn back the clock on civil rights and burden local government with lawsuits.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter charges that the &quot;charitable choice&quot; provisions in the bill allow government-funded employment discrimination, fail to provide adequate secular alternatives for families in need and undermine the prophetic role of religion in society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assert the groups, &quot;H.R. 7&#146;s 'Charitable Choice' provisions represent a step backwards on civil rights, usurp local government rights and undermine the personal religious liberty of people seeking help. We strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 7 until the 'Charitable Choice' provisions are removed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sponsored by Reps. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.) and Tony Hall (D-Ohio), H.R. 7 is designed to funnel tax dollars into the coffers of churches and other &quot;faith-based&quot; organizations to provide social services. It is scheduled to face a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Opponents of the bill said the joint letter indicates the national concern about the measure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This impressive list of signers demonstrates the widespread concern about the Community Solutions Act,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. &quot;I hope the House is wise enough to vote against this misguided and dangerous measure.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unveiled by President Bush Jan. 29, the &quot;faith-based initiative&quot; has become a flashpoint for controversy. Numerous religious and public policy organizations have announced opposition to the plan.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signers of the letter, which was released today and sent to every members of the House, include Americans United for Separation of Church and State; the American Civil Liberties Union; the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; American Federation of Teachers; Anti-Defamation League; Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs; Central Conference of American Rabbis; Friends Committee on National Legislation; Jewish Council for Public Affairs; Justice and Witness Ministries, United Church of Christ; Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); National Education Association; National PTA; NOW Legal Defense Fund; Union of American Hebrew Congregations; Unitarian Universalist Association and Women of Reform Judaism.</font></p>
