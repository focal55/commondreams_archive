- March 7 -  Ralph Nader today urged the

House of Representatives to defeat efforts to wipe out occupational

safety regulations which protect workers from crippling ergonomic

injuries.

<p>Nader described the Senate's defeat of the regulations last night

as a "shameful surrender to a heavy handed campaign by corporate

lobbyists and campaign donors."

<p>"It is now up to the House to ensure that a decade of efforts to

provide protection for the 600,000 workers who suffer painful

repetitive strain and back injuries on the job every year will not

be

lost," Nader said.

<p>Nader said President Bush's support of the corporate campaign

against the protections was a "sad commentary on the priorities of

the new Administration."

<p>"When faced with the demands of the big business community, the

President's claims of 'compassionate conservatism' become farcical,"

Nader said. "This is a prime example of how dangerous the growing

political power of corporations has become when critical health and

safety needs of workers can be so summarily dismissed by the

Congress."

<p>Nader said the new rules drafted and approved by the Occupational

Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were the minimum needed to

protect workers from ergonomic injuries caused by heavy lifting,

repetitive work and poorly designed jobs. The rules require employers

to train workers, find and fix job hazards and provide medical

evaluations to injured workers.

<p>Nader said the lobbyists for the business interests had "wildly

exaggerated" the cost of compliance with the ergonomic injury rules.

Nader said it was the responsibility of the employers to bear the

costs of injury prevention in the workplace, rather than saddling

employees with the financial and physical costs of treatment.
