- May 23 - President Bush and his 

allies in Congress today won Senate passage of a massive, unfair and 

irresponsible tax cut, jeopardizing the nation's fiscal health and 

the future viability of programs relied on by millions of Americans. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate bill, with a true cost likely to be much higher than 

its purported $1.35 trillion price tag, is less expensive and less 

skewed to the America's wealthiest one percent than the version 

pushed by the Bush Administration and passed by the House of 

Representatives. Nevertheless, it is still irresponsibly large and 

unconscionably weighted to benefit the most prosperous Americans. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The reckless and unfair tax cut passed by the Senate today 

threatens our economy and our ability as a nation to address critical 

needs,&quot; said People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas, who 

serves as one of the co-chairs of the Fair Taxes For All coalition. 

&quot;It is vitally important that the conference committee not make the 

damage even greater by adopting more irresponsible elements from the 

House version of the bill and that conferees not try to make the cuts 

permanent.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that nonpartisan budget analysts have said the tax cuts 

could put the stability of the Medicare and Social Security trust 

funds at risk, and radically restrict the ability of the federal 

government to invest in strengthening public schools, enforcing civil 

rights laws, and addressing the enormous impact of poverty and lack 

of access to health care for millions of American children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush recently spoke at Notre Dame about the importance 

of government's role in addressing poverty,&quot; said Neas, &quot;but he 

continues to push for cuts that will dramatically constrain the 

ability of the federal government to address that or any other 

national priority.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas noted that Grover Norquist, one of President Bush's key 

advisers and a leader of the lobbying campaign for the massive tax 

cut, recently acknowledged the radical anti-government goal at the 

heart of this proposal. Norquist is on record saying: &quot;My goal is to 

cut government in half in twenty-five years, to get it down to the 

size where we can drown it in the bathtub.&quot; </font></p>
