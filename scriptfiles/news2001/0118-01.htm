- January 18 - The D.C. police 

department arrested three Greenpeace activists today. Two of the 

activists were anchored to the Interior Building for half an hour, 

carrying a banner reading, "Bush and Norton, Our Land, Not Oil 

Land." The police seized the activists when they rappelled down from 

the building, and took the banner soon after. The international 

environmental group was protesting Interior Secretary nominee Gail 

Norton’s anti-environmental record, which includes plans to drill for 

oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Calling for president-elect 

Bush to adopt emergency measures to phase in renewable energy, 

Greenpeace announced that today’s protest is just the beginning of 

an intensified campaign to safeguard public lands and the 

environmental values of the country.  

<p>

"The police can cut down our banner but we are going to continue to 

carry our message loud and clear to the Bush Administration and to 

the oil industry," said John Passacantando, Executive Director of 

Greenpeace. "America needs to be weaned off of its dangerous 

dependence on fossil fuel. The technology for viable renewable 

energy is sitting right under our noses, waiting for a strong 

commitment from the U.S. government and industry."  

</p>

<p>

Today’s action took place on the first day of Norton’s confirmation 

hearings and just one day before the official release of the third 

scientific assessment report from the world’s top climate scientists, 

predicting global warming increases twice as large as these same 

scientists predicted five years ago. The report, currently being 

reviewed by more than 150 governments in Shanghai, China, further 

projects more extreme weather patterns, floods, droughts, species 

extinction and human health hazards as a consequence of fossil 

fuels use such as oil, coal and gas.  

</p>

<p>

Although reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would 

supply less than a year’s worth of fuel, Norton has repeatedly gone 

on record, advocating opening up these pristine lands for drilling 

and exploration, a move that more than 60% of Americans oppose. 

(Poll conducted by the League of Conservation Voters Education 

Fund)

"Bush’s current energy plan is not only a waste of energy but a 

threat to the planet," said Melanie Duchin, Climate Campaigner, 

Greenpeace Alaska. "We don’t need oil interests in the White 

House, we need a leader with a real energy plan to begin 

emergency initiatives towards a fossil free future."
