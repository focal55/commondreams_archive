<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 

- September 3 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Statement by Jose Ramos-Horta<br>

Winner, Nobel Peace Prize, 1986</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">September 3, 2001<br>

Dili, East Timor</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I was distressed to learn that Amy Goodman's reporting on East Timor has 

been questioned and that some have alleged that the November 12, 1991 Santa 

Cruz massacre may not have taken place. As an East Timorese, I want to 

express my outrage that her account of the massacre has been challenged by 

a campaign of innuendo and insult. As a former journalist, I want to 

express my wholehearted support for Amy Goodman and the staff of Democracy Now!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an occasional guest on her program, I can attest to her professionalism. 

Her reporting on East Timor, some of it done at great personal risk, has 

always been accurate, ground-breaking and vitally important.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Her presence and actions at Santa Cruz are undisputed by observers. The 

massacre of hundreds of peaceful demonstrators and mourners was a turning 

point in our struggle for self-determination. At that tragic time, the 

presence of foreign journalists like Amy, was key. Their words and pictures 

were a vital source of accurate information on the massacre in the face of 

official Indonesian denials and misleading reports. This reporting inspired 

action and policy change worldwide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have especially admired the non-Timorese who have dedicated themselves to 

East Timor. It is not their country, and journalists traveling there faced 

special risks. Although she knew that five foreign journalists had been 

murdered by the Indonesian military in East Timor at the start of the 

invasion in 1975, Amy went to East Timor in 1990 and 1991 to cover a story 

most ignored.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In East Timor, we have renamed a major road Avenida Liberdade da Imprensa, 

or Freedom of the Press Avenue. On that road, a Dutch journalist was 

murdered in September 1999. We have dedicated a memorial to his memory and 

the memories of the other journalists killed while covering East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are now working to build our own media and train our own journalists. I 

can only hope, that they will contribute to our democracy by probing deeply 

and asking the critical questions -- the way Amy has always done.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica and WBAI should be proud to have a journalist of such high caliber 

working for them. They should be supporting her, not attacking her, and 

improving her working conditions, not hindering her ability to do her job.</font></p>
