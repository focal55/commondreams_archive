- September 13 - The American Friends Service Committee 

      (AFSC) today announced it would launch a <i>No More Victims</i> campaign 

      to help support victims and survivors of the Washington, D.C., New York 

      City and Western Pennsylvania tragedies. Its <i>No More Victims</i> campaign 

      is also designed to educate the public about finding peaceful solutions 

      in the face of these terrible acts of anger and hatred and the suffering 

      they caused.

<p align="left">&#147;Our hearts go out to the thousands of victims of these 

      horrible acts of violence and we recognize and share the grief and sorrow 

      felt by the entire country, if not the world. We join in the hope that those 

      who planned and orchestrated these despicable acts will be brought to justice,&#148; 

      stated Mary Ellen McNish, AFSC general secretary. &#147;However, we cannot 

      scapegoat the innocent. We must not repeat the mistakes of the past by targeting 

      those who may look like or share a similar-sounding name, religion or ethnic 

      background with those perceived to be the cause of this suffering.&#148;</p>

    <p align="left">&#147;We have to break the cycle of violence and retaliation,&#148; 

      McNish emphasized, promising to organize and partner with like-minded organizations 

      for public action, including peace vigils, speaking engagements and ways 

      to help heal the scars from this terrible tragedy.</p>

    <p align="left">AFSC also encouraged individuals to stand with Arab and Muslim 

      communities, many of which are being targeted and made scapegoats when they 

      have done no wrong. In addition, the organization announced that it would 

      encourage staff in its 22 offices throughout the United States to work with 

      their local Red Cross to establish blood drives when they are most needed. 

    </p>
