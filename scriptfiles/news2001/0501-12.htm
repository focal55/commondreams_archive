- May 1 - Statement by Alise Frye, 

director of the National Security Project at Taxpayers for Common 

Sense in response to President Bush's speech on missile defense: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush's announcement today is old news. The United 

States has been pursuing a missile defense system for close to 

fifty years, with no system to show for it. Many presidents have 

come and gone with their own visions of a defensive shield for 

American soil, yet each of them have left taxpayers with nothing 

but a multi-billion dollar tab. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is no guarantee that the enthusiasm of missile defense 

supporters will make missile defense work. Combining an 

accelerated target deployment date with difficult technology will 

result in poor and incomplete testing and leave taxpayers less 

secure under a shield that no one can promise will work. Missile 

defense technologies are extremely complex, and no amount of money, 

regardless of how large, will make their development any easier or 

faster -- only more expensive. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even the limited land based system supported by the Clinton 

Administration was going to cost at least $60 billion to develop. 

A much larger layered system as anticipated by the current Bush 

Administration will multiply that cost many times over, without 

increasing the likelihood that it will ever in fact work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether national or global, missile defense shields are not a 

near term reality, regardless of what the true believers may say. 

While research and development efforts will continue, the 

confidence of missile defense cheerleaders will not put the elusive 

shield in our grasp. </font></p>
