- February 22 - &quot;The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) opened doors of opportunity for

people with disabilities. Yesterday's high court decision shuts those doors

on state employees with disabilities and imperils all civil rights laws,&quot;

said NOW Action Vice President Loretta Kane.  &quot;In weakening the ADA, the

U.S. Supreme Court is poised to deliver a debilitating blow to everyone's

civil rights. The question is not when the high court will gut women's

rights and other civil rights laws, but rather how fast and furious the

attacks on basic human rights will come?&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Court's decision in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v.

Garrett elevated states rights over human rights, and sounded a death knell

for justice,&quot; Kane said. The 5 to 4 vote was the same margin by which the

court has restricted the power of Congress and expanded states' rights in a

series of civil rights cases, including United States v. Morrison, which

repealed the civil rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;According to the Rehnquist Court, it is fine to force a woman who is

battling breast cancer to fight for both her job and her life. If this is

compassionate conservatism, then no one is safe. We have not seen such

blatant animosity toward basic human rights in decades,&quot; Kane said. &quot;And so

our movement must fight back harder and stronger to stem this judicial

tyranny.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plans to turn up the political heat in Washington are already underway. On

March 1, 2001, NOW will kick-off Women's History Month by unveiling

emergency plans to fight right-wing attacks on women's rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We will not roll over while the Supreme Court, the Bush administration and

the Republican Congress try to roll back our rights!  We will mount a

massive movement, one which affirms the value and dignity of all people, to

save our rights and the rights of generations to come,&quot; Kane said.
