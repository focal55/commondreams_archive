- April 19 -  The Executive Director of Greenpeace, John Passacantando,

the president of Rainforest Action Network, Randy Hayes, and nearly a dozen

other activists locked themselves inside of the main entrance of the

Environmental Protection Agency today. This protest was the latest in a

series of pre-Earth Day activities against Bush’s recent greenwashing of his

anti-environmental agenda. All were arrested.

<p>"We’ve taken our message from President Bush’s ranch, to the White House and

now to the EPA," said John Passacantando, Greenpeace Executive Director. "We

want this Toxic Texan to know that trashing 30 years of environmental gains,

then making a few token green announcements for Earth Day is an unacceptable

environmental agenda."</p>



<p>Today’s protest is the third Greenpeace action in less than a week. On

Friday, April 13th, Greenpeace activists scaled a water tower in Bush’s

adopted hometown of Crawford, Texas and unfurled a banner reading "Bush-the

Toxic Texan-Don’t Mess With the Earth." Yesterday, the international

environmental group hosted a "Take Back the Earth Day" rally that featured

speakers from across the nation.</p>



<p>"The environmental community is shocked at how much damage one president can

propose in less than 100 days," continued Passacantando. "Even President

Reagan took four years to propose his short sighted environmental agenda and

trash the earth."</p>



<p>Among the many assaults Bush has made to the environment in less than 100

days are:</p>



<p><li> Reversing a campaign pledge to limit carbon dioxide pollution from power

plants,

<li> Cutting a budget for renewable energy programs,

<li> Support for logging and the development on 60 million acres of untouched

national forests,

<li> Plans to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and

drilling, and

<li> Slashing the EPA’s enforcement budget.

<p>In an effort to put a positive spin on his environmental record, President

Bush yesterday expressed support for the international treaty to phase out

of a dozen highly toxic and persistent chemicals known as persistent organic

pollutants, or POPs.</p>



<p>"It’s easy for Bush to say he supports the treaty, but the real signal of

commitment to reducing these dangerous chemicals will be when he fights to

get the treaty ratified through Congress," said Passacantando.
