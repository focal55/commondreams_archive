- June  4 - A new Gallup poll on American attitudes toward homosexuality shows public support continues to build for equal opportunity in the workplace, the Human Rights Campaign said today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also shows increased acceptance among Americans of homosexuality as well as slight erosion in their reluctance to support the extension of marriage benefits to gay and lesbian couples. Eighty-five percent of the Americans polled support equal opportunity in the workplace. In addition, 54 percent of those polled say homosexual relations between consenting adults should be legal while 52 percent say homosexuality is an acceptable &quot;alternative lifestyle.&quot; Further, 44 percent favor allowing homosexual couples to form civil unions and receive some legal rights of married couples, according to the poll, conducted in mid-May.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Clearly, these numbers show dramatic progress in how Americans view gay and lesbian issues,&quot; said David M. Smith, HRC's communications director and senior strategist. &quot;We are most heartened by the continuing growth in support for equal opportunity in the workplace which can only be accomplished by enacting a federal law, such as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smith also noted that discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people is still legal in most jurisdictions in this country. &quot;People can still be fired in this country simply because they are gay, and we are pleased to see a vast majority of Americans agreeing that it is wrong.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most dramatic shift in American public opinion is the increase in perception that homosexuality is biologically based. For the first time in 24 years that Gallup has asked whether homosexuality is something a person is born with or is due to other factors, an equal number of respondents say that homosexuality is genetic as say that it is environmental. It represents a major shift from 1977, when environment was seen as the more prevalent factor by more than a 4-to-1 ratio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While there is a growing body of evidence that indicates there is a biological basis to sexual orientation, science is inconclusive on what causes sexual orientation.&quot; Smith said. &quot;While we encourage more credible research in this area, we do not believe that it should have any bearing on public policy which should treat all people equally with dignity and respect.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the Gallup poll found that only a narrow majority of Americans, or 52 percent, oppose the extension of marriage benefits to gay and lesbian couples. &quot;We feel public opinion is moving the right way regarding recognizing gay and lesbian relationships,&quot; Smith said. &quot;As more and more gay families come forward and America gets to know them, support will continue to increase.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay political organization with members throughout the country. It effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans can be open, honest and safe at home, at work and in the community. </i></font></p>
