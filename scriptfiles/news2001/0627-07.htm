- June 27 - The latest statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau this week show the world what gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people have known all along: that GLBT people exist in small towns and rural areas and not just in large urban areas, as the stereotype often holds. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Census statistics show that same-sex couples live in every one of the 105 counties in Kansas - ranging from sparsely populated Greeley County, with just over 1,500 residents to Sedgwick County, Kansas' most populated county with more than 450,000 residents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new data show that the number of respondents who reported in the year 2000 that they make up same-sex partner households increased since 1990 by more than 600 percent in Alabama; more than 500 percent in Kansas; more than 400 percent in Ohio; more than 300 percent in Missouri; and more than 200 percent in New York. The new statistics reveal the most comprehensive picture ever recorded of the changing nature of the U.S. family in the 21st Century. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Census Bureau figures documenting same-sex partner households have now been released from 15 states and the District of Columbia. On Tuesday, July 3, the U.S. Census Bureau is tentatively scheduled to release data for Colorado, North Dakota, New Mexico, Maryland and Oregon. And on Wednesday, July 11, statistics tentatively are scheduled to be released for Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina, Utah and Washington. A schedule for the remaining states has yet to be released. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTE TO EDITORS: The exact figures from the states released by the U.S. Census Bureau this week are included at the end of this press release and can be found at the NGLTF Census 2000 Resource Page. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Kansas statistics show that we are indeed everywhere,&quot; said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. &quot;We are in large cities and small cities, farm counties and tiny hamlets. This knowledge will help us move forward on the local level as we work to ensure that every gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender family receives the same services, benefits and treatment given to other families.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paula Ettelbrick, NGLTF's family policy director, noted that the U.S. Census does not count single GLBT people, but since 1990 has counted unmarried, same-sex partner households. In 1990, the category of &quot;unmarried partner&quot; appeared on the Census form for the first time. Approximately 150,000 households nationwide self-reported as same-sex unmarried partners - a severe undercount compounded by the U.S. Census Bureau's disqualification of same-sex couples who marked &quot;spouse&quot; to describe their relationship. This year, Ettelbrick noted, the Census reported that it would change same-sex partners who marked &quot;spouse&quot; to &quot;unmarried partner,&quot; resulting in a better count. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Census numbers reflect the changing face of our society,&quot; Ettelbrick said. &quot;As a community, we clearly shifted our focus in the 1990s to securing our family relationships through domestic partner benefits, adoption rights and same-sex marriage. The Census numbers mirror the unprecedented rise in the visibility of our families during the past decade.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the spring of 2000, the NGLTF Policy Institute and the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies sponsored a nationwide campaign called Make Your Family Count!. This public education campaign, which reached approximately 18 million newspaper readers, was aimed at encouraging same-sex couples within GLBT communities to be counted in the U.S. Census. </font></p>
