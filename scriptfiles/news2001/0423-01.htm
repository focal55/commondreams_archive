- April 23 - Recently there have been press reports that Secretary of Defense Donald

Rumsfeld's review of the military will call for an end to two war strategy,

a strategy that calls for America's armed forces to fight and win two major

theater wars simultaneously with little help from our allies.  If Rumsfeld does call for canceling the

two war scenario, this will be an important step towards redesigning

America's armed forces to face the threats of the future.  The following

are some arguments against the two war strategy from the Council for a

Livable World Education Fund's upcoming military spending briefing book.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unnecessary.   There has been no major war in the last century where the U.S. has

fought without allies.  And we have never fought two major wars at the same

time.  Even in World War II, the U.S. performed a holding action in the

Pacific while pressing the war in Europe.  Plus, the U.S. had massive

allied support in that war.  Thus, the two war scenario as envisioned by

current strategy is an illusion.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, U.S. forces are vastly superior in quality, and usually

quantity, to any potential enemy.  Few countries then, if any, will seek to

fight a traditional war against the U.S.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dangerous.  Few military experts believe that future conflicts will be

large-scale land battles. Instead, the far more likely threats are

terrorism, ethnic unrest, peacekeeping, or urban warfare.  However, these

are not the conflicts for which the Pentagon is prepared.  The two-war

strategy &quot;hamstrings the Pentagon,&quot;says Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings

Institution.  &quot;It hurts them in research and development and readiness.&quot;

The National Defense Panel, a Congressionally mandated panel tasked with

critiquing the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, warned that the

strategy is &quot;an inhibitor to reaching the capabilities we need.&quot;  The Panel

concluded that, &quot;a significant share of the Defense Department's resources

is focused on the unlikely contingency that two major wars will break out

at once, putting greater risk on our long-term strategy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Redundant. The Pentagon's minimum group of forces it believes will be

necessary to win one theater war is 4-5 Army divisions (60,000-100,000

troops), 4-5 Marine brigades (12,000-25,000), 10 Air Force fighter wings

(720 planes), 100 Air Force bombers, and 4-5 Navy carrier groups.  However,

this &quot;building block&quot; does not reflect allied support, nor allied military

superiority over North Korea and Iraq.  In the 1999 war in Yugoslavia, the

U.S. did not even use ground troops, nor did we use 100 bombers or four

carrier groups.  Thus, the size of these building blocks are grossly

overstated, even assuming that two major wars do break out.  The U.S. could

fight and win two wars with a smaller force structure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the National Defense Panel's final report to Congress criticized

the two-war strategy as &quot;a force- protection mechanism&#151;a means of

justifying the current force structure.&quot;  In other words, the two-war

strategy is little more than a way to secure additional funding for the

military.
