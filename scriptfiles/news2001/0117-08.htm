- January 17 - Supporters of New York

Pacifica station WBAI (99.5 FM) will demonstrate in front of the

radio station's offices at 120 Wall St. today, from 4-7 p.m.,

to draw attention to what critics are calling on-air censorship,

the silencing of staff dissent and the banning of two additional

unpaid staffers at the listener-sponsored, noncommercial station.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the eve of a protest that was to begin

in front of the Citibank Financial Center at 110 Wall St. and

march to the embattled studios of WBAI, Citibank Vice President

for International, European, Middle Eastern and African Private

Banking, Francesco Rocciolo, told Free Speech Radio News reporter

Miranda Kennedy that he was no longer interested in pursuing his

candidacy for a seat on the board of the 51-year-old Pacifica

Foundation, a board where many businessmen and lawyers have been

seated in years.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rocciolo told Kennedy that he was no longer

a candidate for the board partly due to recent protests during

which his candidacy and place of employment were criticized.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is the first victory in our campaign

against a national board that has lost a 50-year tradition of

grassroots radio, and we will not allow these pro-corporate elements

to silence our network,&quot; said Concerned Friends media-committee

member John Riley. On Saturday, Pacifica issued a statement saying

that &quot;its board of directors does not have any members who

are Citicorp employees.&quot;</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The latest in a series of incidents of censorship

and bannings at WBAI occurred during the Martin Luther King day

broadcast of WBAI's morning program &quot;Wake Up Call,&quot;

co-hosted by Amy Goodman&quot; (recipient of the 1999 George R.

Polk journalism award), when the interim host ordered that Goodman's

microphone be shut-off after she expressed regret that recent

firings and bannings of producers had not been rescinded by the

interim General Manager.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, Jan. 8, award-winning producer

Peter Bochan announced over the air that one week earlier, one

and a half minutes of his year-end round up tape had been deleted

without his knowledge or permission. One removed segment referred

to the firings and bannings at WBAI.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers at today's demonstration reflect

the increasing number of community and advocacy groups which have

joined the resistance to Pacifica management's recent actions.

Charles Kernigan, from the National Labor Committee, a human rights

group at the forefront of the anti-sweatshop movement, Ray LaForest,

a member of WBAI's local advisory board and a longtime union and

Haitian-community activist, and college students from CUNY is

Our Future will speak about the importance of WBAI to their efforts.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Pacifica was founded to be a voice

for grassroots community activists and the disenfranchised--an

essential part of truly democratic discourse. The irony is, at

a time when we need Pacifica's voice more than ever, the network

has lost its way and seems ready to extinguish those voices,&quot;

said E. Anthony Mackall of Concerned Friends of WBAI and SEEDS,

a sustainable-development organization working in African ancestry

communities worldwide.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Resistance to the firings and bannings has

grown since the December 22nd takeover, which supporters call

a &quot;Christmas Coup,&quot; in which the Pacifica Foundation,

based in Washington, D.C., took control of WBAI, a historically

autonomous station, changed locks, fired the program director

and a producer/union steward, as well as banned several other

producers. No reason has been given for the firings and bannings.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WBAI, has been a bastion of free speech

for 40 years, offering progressive and multicultural programming

serving the Tri-state area. The action group, Concerned Friends

of WBAI, formed three months ago, along with many staff members,

are demanding that the fired and banned producers be reinstated,

security guards be removed from the station, and a democratic

process for selection of a General Manager be adopted.</font></P>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerned Friends of WBAI is composed of

listeners, local advisory board representatives, and producers

at the station. The group has organized demonstrations and vigils,

and shortly after the firings, held a mass meeting of 1,200 people

to forge a campaign to regain local autonomy for WBAI. </font><FONT FACE="Arial">
