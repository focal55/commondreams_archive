<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK 

- December 12 - The surest way for the United States to

achieve greater energy independence is through adopting smart growth

policies that reduce suburban sprawl and lessen our dependence on oil,

according to a new book by a leading authority on the American urban

landscape.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Solving Sprawl: Models of Smart Growth from Communities Across

America," published by NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) in

cooperation with Island Press, looks at real-world examples of smart

growth across the country. Authors F. Kaid Benfield, Jutka Terris and

Nancy Vorsanger lay bare a common myth about sprawl - that the

alternative is a halt to growth. As Maryland Gov. Parris N. Glendening

writes in the foreword to the book, growth may be inevitable, but dumb

growth is not.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sprawl is all too familiar: megastores surrounded by acres of asphalt,

cookie-cutter subdivisions, traffic-clogged highways, and farmland

turned into strip malls. Poorly planned, land-hungry dumb growth eats up

farms, meadows and forests. It turns the landscape into wasteful,

sterile office "parks" and subdivisions that serve cars better than

people. "Solving Sprawl" provides important lessons on how to reverse

these trends. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Solving Sprawl" tells the stories of communities that are growing and

developing without ravaging open spaces and depleting precious natural

resources. It offers a blueprint for concerned citizens, visionary

architects, developers and planners, elected officials and local

governments struggling with the problems caused by unrestrained growth.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book looks at 35 communities - in cities ranging from Baltimore,

Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver and Kansas City to suburbs around the

country - that have followed the principles of smart growth to break the

cycle of sprawl. They are planning better, concentrating development

where schools, roads and sewer lines are already in place, and

reinvesting in older communities instead of abandoning them. They are

placing homes near major transit stations or within walking distance of

shops, restaurants and offices. They are building communities that help

preserve natural, open spaces and that are more livable and attractive

than their sprawling counterparts.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Solving Sprawl" celebrates smart-growth success stories like that of

Dallas Uptown, where a public-private partnership is helping Dallas

overcome its image of an overgrown Sunbelt city by building a community

where residents can live, work and play in a safe and attractive

atmosphere, and where driving is a choice, not an imperative. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book also tells the inspiring story of the Dudley Street

Neighborhood Initiative and the amazing turnaround of a neighborhood

that had been one of Boston's poorest, vulnerable to drug dealers and

dumping and devoid of businesses. Residents successfully lobbied City

Hall to clean up the hazardous waste dumped in their neighborhood, then

went on to create affordable housing, turning vacant lots into green

spaces. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And it tells about small, fragile Pearl Lake in Almira Township,

Michigan. When the lake was threatened by development, citizens took

action. They secured grants, raised money through bake sales and

auctions, and worked with the state and a regional land conservancy to

buy lakefront property back from the developer. Today, that property has

been incorporated into a nearby state forest, and it will be permanently

protected. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kaid Benfield, the principal author of "Solving Sprawl," is the director

of NRDC's Smart Growth and Transportation Program in Washington, D.C. He

also is the author of many studies and publications, including the 1999

book, "Once There Were Greenfields: How Urban Sprawl Is Undermining

America's Environment, Economy and Social Fabric." A member of the

National Academy of Sciences public advisory board on transportation and

the environment, he also serves on several other steering committees and

boards related to smart growth. In addition, he is a founder and

executive committee member of Smart Growth America, a nationwide

coalition of organizations working together on smart growth strategies. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jutka Terris, another author of "Solving Sprawl," is an urban planner in

Alexandria, Virginia. She holds a joint masters degree in public policy

and urban planning from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard

University and B.A. in anthropology from Grinnell College. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-author Nancy Vorsanger is a writer and editor living in New York

City. As a staff member and consultant for NRDC and other groups, she

has produced magazine and Internet articles, books, and newsletters on

environmental, educational and criminal justice topics.
