- April 17 - The United States suffered more than $204 billion in damage due to extreme weather in the 1990s-the hottest decade on record-including $8.4 billion in damage in 2000, according to Flirting With Disaster: Global Warming and the Rising Costs of Extreme Weather, a new report released by U.S. PIRG.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, which assesses the insured losses and disaster relief funds connected to extreme weather events, demonstrates that recent weather-related disasters are part of a global trend of rising frequencies and costs of extreme weather, consistent with scientists' projections of the impacts of global warming.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors of the report noted that, in addition to the Bush Administration's announcement on March 13 that the President was reneging on a campaign promise to cut global warming pollution from power plants, President Bush announced that the U.S. would not support the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to cut such pollution. Scientists predict that if global warming pollution is not reduced, global warming will lead to rising sea levels, the spread of disease and hunger, and species extinction. They also link global warming to a documented increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as storms, flooding, droughts, and heat waves. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We simply cannot afford to keep fiddling while the Earth burns,&quot; said U.S.PIRG Global Warming Associate Kate Abend, an author of the report. &quot;By reversing his campaign pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from dirty power plants, President Bush is joining the 'Ostrich Caucus'-- burying his head in the sand to avoid addressing the potentially devastating consequences of global warming. This reversal appears to be a blatant payoff to the polluting industries that funded his campaign, and is a betrayal to the American public,&quot; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2000, there were a record 730 weather-related natural catastrophes reported worldwide, ninety more than the previous record year in 1999. In the 1990s, American communities experienced more than $87 billion in weather-related insured losses, and the government spent more than $65.5 billion in government assistance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

&quot;People around the country are suffering-losing their homes, their businesses, and even loved ones,&quot; said Abend. &quot;By failing to take action, Congress and the President are turning their back on the families, farms, and businesses across the country that increasingly find themselves in harm's way.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the report's findings: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; In the United States, weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s took nearly 4,000 lives and caused nearly $200 billion in economic loss, including 222 lives and $8.4 billion in economic loss for 2000. Worldwide, the weather disaster toll was more than 330,000 lives and more than $646 billion in economic loss, including 8,851 lives and $31 billion in economic loss for 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Worldwide, the number of great weather disasters in the 1990s is more than five times the number for the 1950s, and damages are more than ten times as high (adjusted for inflation).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; The average number of weather-related disaster declarations has more than doubled in recent years, with the 45 declarations in 2000 far exceeding the average 21.7 disaster declarations per year during the 1980s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Weather related damage throughout the 1990s was not centralized in one area of the country. The five states experiencing the most damage (insured loss and government assistance) for the decade were, in descending order: Florida, Texas, California, North Carolina, Minnesota.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Farm states and states struck by hurricanes bore the largest burden per capita. The five states with the highest amount of per capita weather damage (insured loss and government assistance) in 2000 were, in descending order: North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana, Nebraska and Montana.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recognizing that it is impossible to link definitively any single weather event with global warming, U.S. PIRG argues that, with the enormous economic and human costs of extreme weather damage today and scientists' warnings of even more destruction to come, the United States should invest in pollution reduction policies against such risk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noting that curbing global warming will require major reductions in emissions of global warming pollution, the report recommends adoption of simple, effective ways to reduce global warming pollution, including raising miles-per-gallon standards for automobiles and cleaning up old, dirty coal-fired power plants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush says that it will cost too much to tackle the problem of global warming. This report shows that we can't afford not to,&quot; said Abend. &quot;If we fail to curb global warming pollution, the costs will only continue to increase. The President is flirting with disaster.&quot;</font></p>
