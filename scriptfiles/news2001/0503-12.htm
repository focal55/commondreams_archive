- May 3 - The nationwide grassroots human rights organization, the East Timor Action 

Network/U.S. (ETAN), is calling for an international tribunal on crimes 

against humanity in East Timor and an internationally-supervised 

registration and return of refugees now in Indonesia on the second 

anniversary of the agreement that established the East Timor's referendum 

on independence.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ETAN condemns repeated broken promises by the Indonesian government and 

its security forces to disarm and disband militias terrorizing East 

Timorese refugees in Indonesian West Timor, as well as Indonesia's dismal 

failure to hold any military or police officers accountable for the 

extensive human rights violations committed in East and West Timor,&quot; said 

John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of ETAN will participate in a national call-in to U.S. State and 

Defense Department officials on Friday demanding concerted U.S. action to 

promote the return of the refugees and the formation of an international 

tribunal to try those responsible for war crimes and crimes against 

humanity committed in East Timor since Indonesia invaded the territory in 

1975. They will also pressure the officials to maintain the suspension of 

military ties with Indonesia to support East Timor's security and promote 

human rights and democracy in Indonesia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrations will take place in Washington, DC; Madison, Wisconsin; and 

St. Paul-Minneapolis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This week marks two years of broken promises to East Timor and the 

international community by the Indonesian government and its security 

forces. Despite repeated promises by Indonesia, the long-suffering people 

of East Timor have yet to see justice for the crimes committed against 

them. East Timorese refugees in Indonesian West Timor continue to languish 

in militia-controlled camps more than a year and a half after the East 

Timorese voted for over-whelming independence,&quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">May 5 is the two-year anniversary of the agreement between the governments 

of Indonesia and Portugal calling for a UN-supervised vote in East Timor on 

its political status. The agreement, which gave the Indonesian armed forces 

responsibility for maintaining peace and security during the referendum 

process, led to an overwhelming vote in favor of independence for East 

Timor on August 30, 1999. The brutal 24-year-long occupation of East Timor 

by Indonesian security forces had resulted in the deaths of over one-third 

of the East Timorese population.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Indonesian security forces and their militias were responsible for 

extensive human rights violations in East Timor throughout 1999. Military 

intimidation and violence before the vote and the devastating wave of 

violence following the announcement of the ballot killed hundreds of East 

Timorese. Hundreds of women and girls were raped and three-quarters of the 

population was forced from their homes. The military destroyed 70%-80% of 

the country's infrastructure. Today, militias based in West Timor continue 

to launch cross-border raids, attacking UN peacekeepers and civilians 

within East Timor. Up to 100,000 East Timorese refugees remain trapped in 

militia-controlled camps in Indonesian West Timor, where local aid 

organizations report up to five people a day die from malnutrition and 

disease. ETAN has called on the United States government and other nations 

to actively support an international tribunal to prosecute those 

responsible for serious human rights abuses and crimes against humanity in 

East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The East Timor Action Network/U.S. was founded following the November 1991 

massacre of over 270 East Timorese peacefully protesting the Indonesian 

military occupation. ETAN supports a democratic and peaceful transition to 

an independent East Timor. ETAN has 28 local chapters throughout the U.S.
