- April 17 - Starting April 23, 2001, Planned Parenthood of New York City

(PPNYC) will launch its new public awareness campaign Accidents Happen,

promoting use of emergency contraception (EC) to prevent unplanned

pregnancies in New York City and announcing its availability at PPNYC health

centers. The three-pronged campaign will consist of radio and subway

advertisements as well as framed posters in over 100 New York City bars and

restaurants.  To view the Accidents Happen campaign poster and listen to the

radio advertisements, visit our website at <a href="http://www.ppnyc.org">www.ppnyc.org</a>.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether a couple's contraception fails, contraception isn't used, or a woman

is a survivor of rape, EC offers women a strong chance of preventing an

unplanned pregnancy. EC can be taken to prevent unintended pregnancy within

three days of unprotected intercourse.  When EC is taken within 24 hours of

unprotected sex, chances of a woman becoming pregnant decrease by 95%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;PPNYC wanted to take this opportunity to inform women about this highly

effective and safe option to prevent pregnancy,&quot; said Joan Malin, CEO of

PPNYC.  &quot;Widespread use of EC could prevent half of all unintended

pregnancies and half of all abortions.  In New York City alone, with

increased availability and public awareness, EC could potentially eliminate

100,000 unintended pregnancies and up to 50,000 abortions a year.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, EC remains reproductive health care's best kept secret.  A

1999 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that only 11% of American women

are currently aware of EC as an option. A recent PPNYC survey found that 97%

of pharmacists polled were either wholly unknowledgeable or provided

incorrect information on EC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In 2000, PPNYC provided more than 4,500 prescriptions for women for EC, a

70% increase in the number of visits since 1998,&quot; continued Malin. &quot;We

expect to see an even greater increase as we continue to educate New York

City women and health professionals about EC's potential to greatly reduce

the rate of unintended pregnancies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PPNYC's public awareness campaign on EC will begin on April 23 with radio

advertisements. Grammy-winning artists Dice Raw and Scratch from The Roots

will inform women about EC and its availability at Planned Parenthood health

centers on WBLS FM, Hot 97 FM and WKTU FM.  Another Grammy winner, Lilith

Fair-founder Sarah McLachlan, can be heard on WPLJ FM, and a

Spanish-language advertisement will be heard on La Mega. PPNYC will place

framed posters advertising EC in restrooms in over 100 restaurants and bars

in New York City from late April through June. Coasters promoting EC will

also be given to participating restaurants and bars.  Subway advertisements

will be posted from May 1st through June. Total expenditure for the campaign

is approximately $125,000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At PPNYC, visits for EC cost $55 and include a physical examination and a

cycle of birth control pills.  Appointments to obtain EC can be made by

calling PPNYC's confidential appointment and information hotline at (212)

965-7000 or by visiting <a href="http://www.ppnyc.org">www.ppnyc.org</a>.  Walk-in appointments at 26 Bleecker

Street are also welcomed.</font></p>
