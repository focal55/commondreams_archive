- May 25 - At a meeting with Bush Administration

National Security officials, Arab-American and American Muslim leaders

raised serious concerns about Israel's violations of international and

US laws in its attempts to suppress the Palestinian uprising in the

Occupied Territories.  The meeting, organized by ADC and the Arab

American Institute (AAI), was attended by leaders of the major Arab and

Muslim American organizations, including ADC President Hala Maksoud.

They told Bruce Reidel, Special Assistant to the President on Middle

East Affairs, that their communities were outraged by Israel's brutal

actions against Palestinian civilians and the lack of an adequate

response from Washington.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADC President Maksoud said &#147;we strongly communicated that the United

States needs to ensure that Israel stop gobbling up Palestinian land by

expanding its illegal settlements, no matter what excuses are offered.

And we made it very clear that the future of peace in the Middle East

depends on the United States doing everything in its power to bring the

Israeli occupation, which is the cause of the conflict, to a quick and complete end as demanded by international law.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Objected to the spin that Secretary of State Powell put on the

Mitchell Commission Report, downplaying the recommendation that all

Israeli settlement activity be frozen as a key part of any plan to stop

the conflict;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Demanded that the Administration not tolerate any growth, &#147;natural&#148; or

otherwise, to Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land, and that

Administration officials describe Israeli settlements in accurate terms

which recognize their  illegality under international law;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Protested Israel's  illegal use of US supplied arms, pointed out that,

while the Administration has said for some months that it is&#147;investigating the issue,&#148; there is no doubt that Israel has been using

US-supplied arms such as Apache helicopters and F-16 jets in violation

of the Arms Control Export Act, and demanded that the US suspend aid to

Israel;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Pointed out that Administration officials often create a false

equivalence between Israeli troops enforcing an illegal occupation and

Palestinians struggling to be free, and insisted that there is no moral

similarity between violent acts in furtherance of liberation from the

domination of a hostile foreign army and violence by a state designed to

control and oppress millions of people outside its internationally

recognized borders.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Urged the Administration to oppose all efforts in Congress to cut aid

to Lebanon;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Strongly Advocated the immediate lifting of sanctions against Iraq.</font></p>
