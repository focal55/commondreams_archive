- January 9 - The Violence Policy Center (VPC), a national organization 

        working to reduce gun death and injury in America, today released <a href="http://www.vpc.org/studies/ashcroft.htm">John 

        Ashcroft: The Wrong Choice to Enforce America's Gun Laws</a>, 

        an eight-page report detailing U.S. Attorney General-Designate John Ashcroft's 

        record on guns. The report contains seven sections detailing Ashcroft's 

        record: Gun Lobby Campaign Spending; Dismantling the Brady Law; Placing 

        Prosecutions of Illegal Gun Traffickers at Risk; Opposing the Federal 

        Ban on Assault Weapons and High-Capacity Magazines; Support for Arming 

        Felons; Placing Current Federal Gun Laws at Risk; and, Support for Criminals 

        Carrying Concealed Weapons. 

      <P>The Violence Policy Center announced its strong opposition to the nomination 

        of Ashcroft last week. The VPC's announcement represents the first time 

        in the organization's 12-year history that it has publicly opposed a federal 

        cabinet nominee. 

      <P>"John Ashcroft has repeatedly voted to weaken the Brady law and as Attorney 

        General would work closely with the NRA to undermine the few safeguards 

        in place to protect the American public from gun violence," VPC Legislative 

        Director Kristen Rand said today. 

      <P>Issues cited by the VPC in its opposition to Ashcroft and detailed in 

        the study include:

          John Ashcroft would be the first Attorney General in recent history 

          who has been the beneficiary of massive spending by a special interest 

          group with a political agenda that is in direct conflict with the duties 

          of the office. The NRA spent a combined total of $374,137 on behalf 

          of Ashcroft in his failed 2000 Senate reelection bid. The NRA's Political 

          Action Committee contributed $9,900 directly to the Ashcroft campaign 

          and spent $339,237 in independent expenditures on his Senate effort. 

          The NRA also contributed $25,000 to the Ashcroft Victory Committee in 

          March of 2000. <br>

        <li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">In 

          1998 Ashcroft worked on behalf of the gun lobby in opposition to a provision 

          in juvenile justice legislation which would have expanded federal authority 

          to prosecute illegal firearm traffickers. Ashcroft's concerns centered 

          on a provision in the bill that would have added federal firearm violations 

          to the list of offenses that would trigger prosecution under the federal 

          Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. The change 

          would have subjected firearm traffickers to harsh federal penalties.<br>

          </font></font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The 

          Violence Policy Center has obtained a copy of a handwritten note from 

          Ashcroft to Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America 

          (GOA) and the father of the modern militia movement. In 1996, Pratt 

          was forced to take a leave of absence as co-chair of Pat Buchanan's 

          presidential campaign after being linked with white supremacists and 

          right-wing militia leaders. In the letter, Ashcroft thanked Larry Pratt 

          for "bringing to my attention the RICO (2nd amendment) problems with 

          the juvenile justice bill."<br>

          <br>

          </font></font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">He 

          went on to say, "I am working to see that the RICO provisions are stripped 

          from the bill prior to floor consideration." He then referenced a letter 

          that he and Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) had written to Senator Orrin 

          Hatch (R-UT). The bill was later amended to weaken the provision dealing 

          with illegal firearms trafficking.<br>

        <li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft supports NRA efforts to immediately destroy essential records 

          maintained under the Brady law's National Instant Criminal Background 

          Check System (NICS) that ensure the system's effectiveness and accuracy. 

          Currently the records are retained for six months. <br>

        <li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">Ashcroft 

          voted last Congress to weaken the Brady law. During Senate debate on 

          whether to expand the current Brady NICS check to all sales at gun shows 

          (not just those by federally licensed dealers), Ashcroft not only voted 

          against the measure, but voted for legislation sponsored by Senator 

          Hatch that would have weakened the Brady law by reducing the time allowed 

          to conduct the background check by<i> all</i> gun-show sellers—including 

          licensed dealers—from three business days to 24 hours.<br>

          <br>

        <li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"> 

          Ashcroft opposes the federal assault weapons ban. In September 2004 

          the federal ban on specific assault weapons and new high-capacity magazines—which 

          is supported by virtually every major national law enforcement organization—will 

          come up for reauthorization by Congress. Ashcroft opposes the assault 

          weapons ban and twice voted in the Senate against a ban on the importation 

          of foreign-made high-capacity magazines. The Justice Department will 

          likely play a key role in determining what form the reauthorized ban 

          will take and whether or not needed improvements to the ban are made.

        Public Policy Director Joe Sudbay states, "During the 2000 elections, 

        the National Rifle Association claimed that if George Bush won the presidency, 

        the NRA would be working out of his office. Now they've gone one better. 

        If John Ashcroft becomes attorney general, the NRA will be running the 

        Justice Department."</font></font></p>
