- February 1 - NARAL President Kate

Michelman today released the following statement on the vote in the

Senate to confirm John Ashcroft as the Attorney General.

<p>"The closeness of today's vote demonstrates the strong

opposition to John Ashcroft's extreme views and record and the

divisive nature of his nomination.

<p>"Today the majority of pro-choice senators made a powerful

statement that they find the extreme views and record of John

Ashcroft unsuitable for the role of Attorney General; that someone

with a long history of unmitigated attacks on women's established

constitutional rights is simply unacceptable. The closeness of the

vote clearly demonstrates the divisive nature of Bush's nomination.

<p>"Though we did not succeed in defeating Ashcroft, we have

established -- and served notice to President Bush -- that any

nominee with a record of assault on a woman's right to choose will

be met with broad and powerful opposition.

<p>"President Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft unleashed a

firestorm across America resulting in historic opposition in the

Senate. This serves as a clear and powerful reminder to President

Bush that he and his new Attorney General have no mandate from the

people to roll back women's constitutional rights.

<p>"NARAL is disappointed that some pro-choice senators elevated

politics over principle in voting to confirm Ashcroft. At the same

time, we are grateful to those who took courageous and principled

stands in voting against him.

<p>"As demonstrated by our campaign in opposition to Ashcroft's

nomination, NARAL is prepared to do whatever is necessary to defeat

nominations to the Supreme Court and lower circuit federal courts

that would threaten a woman's right to choose."
