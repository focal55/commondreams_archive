<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - October 25 - Pacifica's board chair, former Los Angeles city councilman Robert Farrell, tonight (Oct. 24) announced he has fired Executive Director Bessie Wash.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wash, formerly station manager of Pacifica station WPFW, was named executive director by a board then controlled by former chair Mary Frances Berry. Wash has presided over a total deterioration of the network and its finances, including the banning of Pacifica's only remaining nationwide program, &quot;Democracy Now,&quot; the &quot;mainstreaming&quot; of the once alternative daily Pacifica Network News, now the target of a boycott and a strike, the &quot;Christmas Coup&quot; at WBAI in New York, which resulted in dozens of staff members being fired and banned, and the expenditure of an estimated two million dollars on legal fees, public relations firms, and security services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farrell and the Pacifica Board majority have also agreed to a two and a half year old demand from KPFA's staff and community for mediation of the dispute which began in April, 1999 with the firings of popular KPFA station manager Nicole Sawaya and long-time Pacifica national affairs correspondent Larry Bensky.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mediation, sparked by four pending lawsuits on behalf of listeners, national, and local advisory board members, is scheduled to take place November 1 in San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A report published in today's San Francisco Chronicle says that Farrell, fellow board member Wendell Johns, and newly appointed board member former D.C. mayor Marion Barry will represent Pacifica.</font></p>

KPFA Evening News, Wed., Oct. 24, 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica &quot;dissident&quot; board member Pete Bramson (KPFA, Berkeley) said on KPFA this evening (approx. 7:25 p.m. PT) that Pacifica National Board Chair Bob Farrell phoned him this evening to say that he (Farrell) has told Bessie Wash to leave her post effective tomorrow morning.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Bramson, Farrell said Wash expressed some concerns about the action, and indicated she may take legal action against Farrell or Pacifica.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When asked, Bramson said there has been no Board vote regarding Wash's tenure, and that he does not know whether there would be enough votes to oust Wash were it brought to a vote of the Board.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bramson said he was surprised by the call from Farrell. While he and Farrell had had previous conversations about Wash's performance, Bramson was not aware Farrell was about to oust Wash.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asked what impact the announced ouster of Wash might have on Pacifica, Bramson said it was not yet clear. &quot;Change comes slowly to Pacifica, as you know,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Farrell's reasons for firing Wash were not explained.</font></p>
