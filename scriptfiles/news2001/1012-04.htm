- October 12 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAM BARRATT, <a href="mailto:presoxfam@comsats.net.pk">presoxfam@comsats.net.pk</a>, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk" target="_new">http://www.oxfam.org.uk</a><br>

Barratt is the spokesperson for Oxfam International in Islamabad. He said 

today: "So much more needs to be done to prevent mass starvation in 

Afghanistan this winter. Prior to the crisis, the World Food Program, with 

the help of Oxfam and other groups, was feeding 3.7 million people. That 

has stopped. The airdrops will -- at the very best -- feed 130,000 people."

Chancellor professor of political science at the University of 

Massachusetts at Dartmouth, Aruri is author of the book "The Obstruction Of 

Peace: The U.S., Israel and the Palestinians" and the essay "America's War 

Against Iraq: 1990-1999." He said today: "Bush seems to be pleased that 

Arafat is reining in protests and free expression. There is still ambiguity 

on the U.S. stance on Iraq, though we should recall that the U.S. is 

continuing to bomb Iraq, as it has on a weekly basis for two years now. 

Bush's emphasis that this is not a war against Islam does several things, 

including helping protect U.S. client regimes."

Last night, President Bush said: "I'm amazed that there is such 

misunderstanding of what our country is about, that people would hate us." 

Toensing, editor of Middle East Report, said today: "It's not that Arab and 

Muslim people hate us, rather, they feel a deep ambivalence -- they respect 

us as people, but are highly critical of our government's policies. They 

see deep contradictions between our government's stated goals and reality: 

It talks about self-determination, but it helps Israel deny that to the 

Palestinians. It talks about justice and fairness, but the U.S.-led 

sanctions on Iraq punish the Iraqi people for the crimes of their brutal 

dictator. It claims to be peaceful, but its bombing has already killed 

innocent people in Afghanistan."

Director of the Middle East Children's Alliance, Lubin said today: "The 

children in Afghanistan have been suffering for over 20 years. It is 

cynical for President Bush to ask American school children to each send one 

dollar to the White House to help them while our government is bombing 

their country day and night. We must look at our government's policies in 

that region including the sanctions on the children of Iraq and our support 

for the brutal occupation of Palestine."

Hagopian, professor emerita of sociology at Simmons College in Boston and 

author of several articles on the Arab world, said today: "Since the end of 

World War II, when the U.S. took over where the colonial powers left off, 

the U.S. in essence has undermined democracy and supported so-called 

moderate Islamic regimes and so-called 'liberal regimes' -- in which the 

president 'wins' 99 percent of the vote. In both cases they're not 

democratic. As grievances have built up in the Mideast, the fanatic 

figures, whether they are Bin Laden or the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, are able 

to offer an outlet for that anger. Democracy in Arab countries would mean 

that popular opinion could be acted upon and that Arab states could deal 

with the U.S. based on equity."
