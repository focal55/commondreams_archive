- June 11 - The non-profit Clean Air 

Trust today accused the White House of &quot;playing politics&quot; by 

rejecting a request by California to avoid mandatory use of ethanol 

in reformulated gasoline in the state. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trust noted that the White House ignored the advice of the 

Environmental Protection Agency, which had concluded that granting 

California a waiver from the requirement would lead to less 

smog-forming pollution than if an ethanol mandate were required. 

(The official EPA recommendation is available from the Clean Air 

Trust.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Trust also noted that the California Energy Commission has 

predicted that White House decision could lead to gasoline 

shortages and higher gas prices. The ethanol lobby had stridently 

opposed California's request. An official announcement is said to 

be imminent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The White House is simply playing politics with this issue,&quot; 

said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust. 

&quot;This will mean dirtier air and price hikes at the pumps in 

California,&quot; he added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is an astonishingly bad decision -- the California 

equivalent of arsenic,&quot; O'Donnell said, referring to the Bush 

Administration's earlier decision to rescind arsenic-in-drinking 

water standards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again, the views of EPA's professional staff have been 

thrown in the trash in favor of political considerations,&quot; 

O'Donnell added, noting EPA had concluded that the White House 

decision would mean up to an additional 26 tons a day of 

smog-forming pollution in California. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue arose because the Clean Air Act requires that gas sold 

in the nation's smoggiest cities contain an &quot;oxygenate&quot; that -- in 

theory -- makes it burn more cleanly. The requirement applies to 

about 70 percent of the gas sold in California. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Refiners have generally met this oxygen requirement through the 

additive MTBE. But California ordered MTBE to be phased out by the 

end of next year because it has contaminated groundwater. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only practical alternative to MTBE is ethanol, which the 

California Air Resources Board found (and EPA agreed) creates more 

smog-forming pollution because it is more volatile. In other 

words, the oxygen mandate would become an ethanol mandate once MTBE 

is banned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">California's refiners and the state have concluded that they can 

make the cleaner-burning gasoline without any mandatory oxygen 

component. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mandatory ethanol use poses additional challenges. It generally 

must be shipped to California from the Midwest. Because of 

limited ethanol supplies in California, specialists with the 

California Energy Commission have warned that an ethanol mandate 

could trigger a 6-10 percent gasoline shortfall by 2003, which 

would result in gasoline price spikes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The only real question here is why did the Bush Administration 

opt for more dirty air and more energy problems in California,&quot; 

said O'Donnell. &quot;Was this done to cause political damage to 

California Governor Gray Davis? Was it to punish California's 

voters? Was it a payoff to ethanol producer Archer Daniels 

Midland, which contributed heavily to the Bush inauguration -- or 

was it all of the above?&quot; </font></p>
