<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- January 19 - The second sea shipment of U.S.-origin plutonium undertaken during the



Clinton Administration is set to depart today from Cherbourg, France for



Japan. In the last half of 2000, the



U.S. Government secretly reviewed and approved security arrangements for the



controversial transport, which consists of 28 mixed uranium-plutonium oxide



(MOX) fuel assemblies, containing about a quarter-ton of weapons-usable



plutonium.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">“Shipping



plutonium around the globe in lightly armed commercial vessels presents a security as well as a proliferation threat



and results from a failed policy to curb burgeoning plutonium stockpiles,” said Tom Clements, Executive Director



of the Nuclear Control Institute (NCI) in Washington. NCI is a nuclear non-proliferation center which seeks to halt



civilian commerce in plutonium. “The



security and proliferation risks of these shipments cannot be justified because



there is no energy need for plutonium use in Japan, given the glut in non-weapons-usable



uranium,” said Clements.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The



shipment highlights the failure of the 1993 Clinton non-proliferation policy



aimed at halting recovery and use of plutonium and presents a challenge to the



Bush Administration to readdress plutonium policy. Internationally, weapons-usable plutonium stockpiles have more



than doubled under the Clinton Administration, to over 200 tons, with Britain,



France, Japan, Germany and Russia holding the largest stocks of this



material. Amounts of plutonium



separated from spent fuel annually under the Clinton Administration dwarf



annual figures for any earlier Administration, with the amount of civilian



plutonium now rivaling stocks of weapons-grade plutonium held by the nuclear



weapons states.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surpluses of weapons-usable plutonium continue to grow at



an alarming rate given unrestrained reprocessing of spent fuel but limited use



of plutonium as fresh fuel in European and Japanese reactors. “Lack of constraint in plutonium stockpiling



is a little-noticed non-proliferation failure of the Clinton Administration,”



said Paul Leventhal, President of NCI. “Although the Clinton Administration turned its back on the



proliferation dangers of the buildup of vast quantities of weapons-usable



plutonium, we are hopeful that the Bush Administration will thoroughly review



the national-security dimensions of this issue and adopt tough policies against



plutonium stockpiling and use.”

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under



the 1988 U.S.-Japan nuclear cooperation agreement, shipments of plutonium are



to be undertaken only with an armed escort vessel, but the State Department has



reinterpreted the agreement to allow plutonium shipments without military



escorts. According to the new



interpretation, two British-flagged commercial transport vessels, the <i>Pacific



Teal</i> and <i>Pacific Pintail</i>, equipped with light cannon, machine guns



and carrying special police, will “escort” one-another on the 18,000-mile



voyage. In order to meet the terms of



the 1988 agreement, a shipment of 1.7 tons of plutonium took place in 1992,



escorted by a specially-built Japanese coast guard “plutonium escort” vessel. The current shipment is expected to travel



to Japan via South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, though the route will not be



announced until January 19, the day after departure.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until recently, Japan shipped



thousands of tons of spent fuel to reprocessing factories operated by BNFL and



Cogema (France) for reprocessing. In



addition to a vast quantity of high-level and low-level nuclear waste, Japan



has accumulated over 32 tons of weapons-usable plutonium, with over 28 tons



being stockpiled in Europe. Given the



failure of earlier plans to use the plutonium in reactors called “breeders,”



capable of producing more plutonium than they consume, plans in Japan and



elsewhere have shifted to use of MOX in conventional light-water reactors



(LWRs). Due to the poor economics of



reprocessing and MOX use and given that LWRs were not designed for MOX use, the



plutonium use program in Europe and Japan is coming under increasing technical



and economic pressure. Also, the MOX



program there is much-delayed and stalled in 1999 when irregularities were



discovered in fabrication of the first consignment of MOX fuel shipped from



British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (BNFL) to Japan.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently,



a shipment of highly radioactive



reprocessing waste is being transported from France to Japan. The <i>Pacific Swan</i>, carrying 198 half-ton



logs of glassified reprocessing waste, last weekend rounded Cape Horn, South



America on a two-month voyage to Rokkasho, Japan, site of temporary storage of



high-level waste. The vessel passed



through the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of both Argentina and Chile in



spite of an assessment by an expert in



international maritime law and adviser to NCI which affirms that states have



the right to force such vessels carrying ultra-hazardous cargoes out of their



EEZ’s lacking advance consultation and consent by en route states. Such consultation is lacking for the MOX



shipment as well, and the shipping states have also ignored pleas from en route



states that environmental assessments, adequate emergency and salvage plans,



and a comprehensive liability regime be prepared.</font></p>
