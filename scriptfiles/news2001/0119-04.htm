- January 19 - After suffering two tragic accidents last year, the MarineCorps' vaunted MV-22 Osprey program has again come under fire.  Federal

investigators raided the North Carolina headquarters of the only Osprey

squadron yesterday relieving the commander.  Lt. Col. Odin F. Leberman has

been charged with falsifying maintenance records in an effort to aid the

troubled program as it moved toward full-scale production. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It will be difficult for the Osprey to recover from this,&quot; said John

Isaacs, President of the Council for a Livable World, a group that opposes

production of the V-22, &quot;The program has always been of questionable

military value, but its strong congressional backing made it the Teflon

weapon &#151;  no criticism could stick.  But now that political cover is coming

off.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his tenure as Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney attempted to kill the

Osprey, a troop transporter that takes off like a helicopter and flies like

a plane, but the program was saved by congressional supporters.  The cost

of an Osprey has ballooned to $83 million a copy and much of technology is

still not ready.  A November 30, 2000 report from Philip Coyle, the

Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, claimed the Osprey

will be more difficult to maintain than its predecessors, the CH-46E and

the CH-53D helicopters, and an August 16, 2000 Inspector General report

described 22 &quot;major deficiencies&quot; within the program.  Moreover, despite

the Osprey's high speed transport capabilities it cannot carry heavy

equipment.  Consequently, troops delivered by the Osprey will often have to wait for heavy equipment to arrive from the traditional helicopters.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a wake up call,&quot; claimed Isaacs, &quot;These allegations of fraud

illustrate the severity of the Osprey's many technical problems and the

Pentagon's flawed procurement process.  Clearly, the Osprey should be

canceled, but other programs need to be questioned as well.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coincidentally, the General Accounting Office released a report on

Wednesday accusing the Pentagon of using &quot;high risk acquisition strategies

such as acquiring weapons based on optimistic assumptions about the

maturity and availability of enabling technologies.&quot;  One example cited by

the GAO is  the Army's plan to begin producing the Comanche helicopter

before starting initial operational testing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is not just about the Osprey,&quot; added Isaacs, &quot;The Pentagon is

planning to spend billions on unneeded, unproven, Cold War era weapons such

as the F-22, the New Attack Submarine, and the Crusader howitzer.&quot;  </font></p>
