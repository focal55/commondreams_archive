- October 26 -  Voter guides prepared by TV preacher Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition for the Nov. 6 Virginia elections are skewed toward Republican candidates and are therefore inappropriate for church distribution, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The campaign materials, unveiled by the Coalition this week, reflect a clear partisan bias in support of gubernatorial candidate Mark Earley and other Republican nominees. Because federal tax law prohibits tax-exempt institutions, including churches, from engaging in any kind of partisan politicking, Americans United said churches that distribute the guides may face legal difficulties.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition plans to distribute these guides through evangelical churches in Virginia. AU said the issues chosen and the language used are manipulated to persuade a conservative Christian audience to vote for certain candidates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These guides are clearly stacked to direct conservative Christian voters to support Republican candidates,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;No one could look at this guide and say with a straight face that they're non-partisan and educational.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this week, Americans United sent letters to churches throughout the state, encouraging pastors to consider the legal and ethical consequences of distributing slanted voter guides.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The guides select specific issues to make the Republican a saint, and the Democrat a sinner,&quot; Lynn added. &quot;Just as importantly, the guides phrase the issues in a biased fashion, and then give misleading and sometimes wrong information. These guides don't belong in churches, they belong in the recycling bin.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn added that it's little surprise the guides favor the GOP. According to media accounts, Christian Coalition President Robertson has already contributed $35,000 to Earley's campaign.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These voter guides are just another Robertson contribution to the GOP campaign,&quot; said AU's Lynn. &quot;Churches should not participate in this sleazy political charade. Houses of worship are supposed to spread religious truths, not campaign lies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United's analysis reveals serious flaws that question the integrity of the Coalition's voter guide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Coalition's guide, for example, says Mark Warner, the Democratic candidate, opposes &quot;voluntary prayer in public school.&quot; In public statements, Warner has never said he opposes the rights of students to pray, and in fact, has expressed support for Virginia's moment-of-silence law. The guide also says Warner opposes parental notification for minors seeking abortion, when in fact, Warner is on record supporting parental notification laws.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, of the five issues where Warner's alleged position is listed, two are factually inaccurate. In the other five issues listed in the guide, Warner's position is indicated as &quot;no response.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While Robertson and his group may be trying to use churches to create a political machine, religious leaders should reject his advances,&quot; concluded AU's Lynn. &quot;The Coalition's campaign materials are slanted campaign propaganda. Pastors shouldn't touch these guides with a ten-foot pole.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
