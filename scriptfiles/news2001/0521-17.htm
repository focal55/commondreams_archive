- May 21 - In an ironic coincidence, 

the Call to Preserve the Estate Tax, first signed by Bill Gates, 

Sr., topped 1,000 signers today -- the same day the Senate 

debated repeal of the estate tax. Many of the signers are 

available to critique the Senate tax cut bill, as are these 

spokespeople from United for a Fair Economy: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- CHUCK COLLINS, Program Director of United for a Fair 

Economy, co-founder of Responsible Wealth, and co-author of &quot;Economic Apartheid in America.&quot; &quot;I want to live in a country where what you do in your life 

counts more than what family you are born into. This core 

American value is jeopardized by the Senate's tax cut bill. The estate tax repeal is the most regressive feature of a regressive 

bill. Like Republican President Theodore Roosevelt and Supreme 

Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who advocated for creation of the 

estate tax over 85 years ago, we are concerned about the dangers 

to the American republic posed by concentrated wealth and 

power.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- BETSY LEONDAR-WRIGHT, Communications Director of United 

for a Fair Economy, co-author of &quot;Shifting Fortunes: The Perils 

of the Growing American Wealth Gap.&quot; &quot;How rapidly Candidate Bush's slogan 'Leave no child behind' 

morphed into President Bush9s efforts to leave no millionaire 

behind! Given the many cuts in children9s programs and the tax 

cuts skewed towards the very rich, the Bush budget entails a 

redistribution of wealth from children to the wealthiest heirs. 

Children with multimillionaire parents may enjoy a tax-free 

inheritance, but the other 98 percent of children will be out of 

luck.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- MIKE LAPHAM, Co-Director of Responsible Wealth, organizer 

of the Call to Preserve the Estate Tax. &quot;We need a healthy debate on the questions raised by the 

tax cut bill: Who needs tax breaks more, low-wage workers or 

high earners and heirs? How will states manage without the 

$5.5 billion in annual revenue that comes to them through the 

federal estate tax? What will be the impact on our economy, 

democracy and civic life of further concentrating wealth and 

power in the hands of a few, at a time of the greatest 

inequality since the 1920s? Unfortunately the Senate is ramming 

this bill through before this debate can take place.&quot; </font></p>
