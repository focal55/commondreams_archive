- September 4 -  Wade

Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on

Civil Rights (LCCR), the largest, oldest, and most diverse

coalition of civil and human rights organizations in the United

States, issued the following statement today condemning the U.S.

government's decision to walkout of the U.N. World Conference

Against Racism (WCAR) being held in Durban, South Africa.

<p>"The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights condemns the

decision by the United States to withdraw from the WCAR. The

government's stated reason for leaving the conference was to

condemn verbal assaults against Israel and Jews, including

language that equated Zionism with racism. While anti-Semitic

sentiments expressed at the conference are repugnant, some

representatives to the conference are working to re-write the

disputed language. The United States' decision to withdraw

forecloses its ability to be part of the ongoing process to

improve the language."

<p>"By withdrawing, the United States has squandered an

opportunity to participate in important issues facing the

country and the world. While we understand the gravity of the

situation in the Middle East, focusing solely on this issue

overshadows discussion of other critical challenges including

contemporary slavery, caste discrimination, criminal justice,

poverty, education, rights of indigenous peoples and gender

discrimination. The refusal to take part in this historic

discussion of important human rights issues is an abdication of

U.S. leadership in the global effort against racism and

bigotry."

<p>"The Leadership Conference is also dismayed by the

expressions of anti-Semitism voiced by a variety of sources.

Such hate speech is not redeemed by the fact that Palestinians

and other groups have also been subjected to abusive language.

Religious hate has no place at a conference dedicated to the

elimination of racism and other forms of intolerance. It is not

acceptable for any racial, religious, or ethnic group to be made

the target of discrimination."

<p>"The government's withdrawal deprives advocates from the

United States of formal representation and makes it extremely

difficult to advance our aims for equal justice. The U.S. has

been unwilling to engage in a conversation about reparations,

the death penalty and several other important issues of criminal

justice. While anti-Semitism is the issue that has been most

prominent in the U.S. exit, other matters may have also played

a role. Had the U.S. government stayed, it could have

participated in the progress already being made on disability

and other issues. Everyone should know that LCCR and its member

organizations will vigorously pursue these critical matters at

the conference and with the U.S. government when we return to

the United States."
