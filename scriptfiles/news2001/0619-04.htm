- June 19 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) has nominated Israeli conscientious objector Gabriel Wolff for the Reebok Human Rights Award. Gabby is a 19-year-old Israeli who has refused military conscription and has served several prison terms as a result. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The award, established in 1988, honors young people who have made significant contributions to the cause of human rights, often against great odds. The purpose of the award is to shine a positive, international light on the award recipients and support their work in human rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In making the nomination Mary Ellen McNish, AFSC general secretary, noted: &quot;In a time when Israel is in such crisis, the courage it takes for Gabby to maintain his principles is enormous and should be recognized. He offers hope to his peers in Israel, Palestine and the rest of the world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC was founded in 1917 to give conscientious objectors to war a constructive alternative to military service. AFSC has been working in the Middle East since the winter of 1949 when, at the request of the United Nations, it received, registered and cared for Palestinian refugees in Gaza. Since then AFSC has continued the search for justice and peace in the region. Quaker International Affairs Representatives (QIARs) travel exhaustively between Israel and neighboring Arab countries, promoting dialogue and understanding among people, especially youth and women. Following the 1967 war, AFSC was among the first U.S. organizations to affirm that peace in the Middle East depended upon the mutual recognition of Palestinian and Israeli rights to self-determination, including the Palestinian's right to form their own state alongside Israel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC continues to work across lines of conflict and to provide opportunities for exchanges and dialogue. The nomination of Gabriel Wolff for the Reebok Human Rights Award, affirming the right to freedom of conscience, is a step toward peace. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In many countries of the world, there are other young people refusing to be part of the military apparatus of their nations.&quot; McNish states. &quot;They too are struggling for the recognition of their human rights to be conscientious objectors as they stand up for what they believe and actively work for peace. Gabriel Wolff's unwavering commitment to exercise his right to conscientious objection is a clear illustration of young people working to build a better world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Previous Reebok Human Rights Award winners include: Julianna Dogbadzi from Ghana, a former slave who fights to end the tradition of enslaving women in religious shrines; Abraham Gebreyesus from Eritrea, a landmine survivor who advocates the rehabilitation and reintegration of landmine survivors back into society; and Julie Su, a U.S. lawyer and advocate for immigrant workers victimized by abusive and illegal labor practices </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice. </i></font></p>
