- March 7 - At the same moment the new U.S. Trade Representative, 

Robert Zoellick, was urging Congress to grant President Bush new 

international trade powers, a lawsuit was filed against him down the street 

in U.S. District Court. The suit challenges Zoellick's decision to keep the 

public in the dark about the administration's latest trade negotiations for 

the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas, which would expand the North 

American Free Trade Agreement -- NAFTA -- to encompass the entire hemisphere.



<p>The lawsuit, being filed Wednesday by Earthjustice on behalf of the Center 

for International Environmental Law, seeks to force the USTR to disclose 

written proposals it has made to other governments concerning provisions of 

the FTAA agreement, a treaty that would bind the United States to powerful 

new trade rules. USTR refused CIEL's request to make the documents public.



<p>"USTR is negotiating binding rules that could affect the ability of the 

United States to protect the environment and human health," said Stephen 

Porter, Senior Attorney with CIEL. "To hide what it is doing from concerned 

citizens is shameful for a government that considers itself the world's 

model for democracy. The USTR is willing to give these documents to 33 

foreign nations, but not the American public."



<p>Using the Freedom of Information Act, CIEL asked USTR to disclose documents 

it provided to foreign negotiators during meetings last year to discuss 

potential FTAA provisions protecting foreign investors. Similar provisions 

in the NAFTA have been the basis for a $970 million dollar challenge to a 

California plan to phase out the use of a harmful gasoline additive. 

Extending these rules to the FTAA could further weaken the ability of the 

United States to protect the environment and human health.



<p>Although USTR admitted the existence of the documents, it refused to make 

them public, claiming they were protected by FOIA's exemption for "inter- 

and intra-agency communications protected by the deliberative process 

privilege." However, as CIEL made clear to USTR before filing its complaint 

today, the documents do not qualify for the exemption and USTR waived any 

privilege when it disclosed the records to foreign governments 

participating in the treaty negotiations. USTR did post sketchy summaries 

of the documents on its website, but they conceal more than they reveal, 

according to CIEL and Earthjustice.



<p>"Transparency and public participation are hallmarks of democracy," said 

Martin Wagner, Director of International Programs for Earthjustice. "If 

citizens are kept in the dark until negotiations are completed, they will 

never be able to provide useful advice concerning rules that would directly 

affect their lives and health. The important decisions happen early in the 

process. We are only left to wonder what they're trying to hide. Are US 

trade officials giving foreign investors the power to overturn our health 

and environmental laws? The Bush administration won't say. We are suing for 

openness."
