- June 14 - The National Women's 

Law Center (NWLC) today denounced Senator Helms' amendment 

hindering teen access to emergency contraception as a dangerous 

restriction that would result in more unintended teen 

pregnancies. The amendment to the Elementary and Secondary 

Education Act (S. 1) requires school-based clinics to obtain 

written parental consent before distributing emergency 

contraception to students. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This restriction will harm the health and well-being of our 

teenagers,&quot; said Marcia D. Greenberger, NWLC co-president. &quot;The 

amendment creates a dangerous barrier that will deter young 

people from seeking time-sensitive health services and valuable 

STD counseling.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies show that teens will delay or forgo getting help at 

all if they have to obtain parental consent for emergency 

contraception. Limiting access to this health service places 

teens at risk for unintended pregnancy and misses an opportunity 

to counsel them on the benefits of delaying sexual activity, the 

risks of unprotected intercourse, and the importance of being 

tested for sexually transmitted diseases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Emergency contraceptive pills are a large dose of ordinary 

birth control pills taken within 72 hours following unprotected 

sex or contraceptive failure. They reduce the risk of pregnancy 

as much as 89 percent. Contrary to the claims of anti-choice, 

anti-family planning advocates, emergency contraception does not 

work like mifepristone (RU 486) which disrupts or interrupts an 

established pregnancy. Emergency contraception is another way of 

administering the pill. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Helms amendment would override decisions by local 

communities on how to provide health services to adolescents. 

Local advisory boards consisting of parents, students, and other 

community representatives usually decide what services 

school-based health centers provide. These 25 states and the 

District of Columbia explicitly allow teens confidential access 

to contraceptive services: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, 

California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, 

Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, 

Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South 

Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The amendment also flouts the recommendations of major 

medical and public health organizations, like the American 

Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and 

Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which 

oppose mandatory parental consent requirements for family 

planning services. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Numerous assaults on family planning by Congress and the 

Administration show just how much basic reproductive health 

services are at risk. In addition to the Senate's vote on the 

Helms amendment, the House has already passed the Unborn Victims 

of Violence Act, which would recognize for the first time a 

zygote, blastocyst, embryo or fetus as a &quot;legal person,&quot; and has 

voted to reinstate the global gag rule. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In just five short months, President Bush has reinstated the 

global gag rule, proposed eliminating contraceptives from 

federal employees' health insurance plans, proposed cutting the 

domestic family planning program (Title X) and announced plans 

to change an existing regulation to make it harder for minors to 

obtain family planning and reproductive health services. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Access to family planning services is a critical concern for 

American women,&quot; said Greenberger. &quot;Yet this Administration and 

Congress have shown an extraordinary eagerness to take extreme 

positions on this issue and put themselves outside of America's 

mainstream.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Women's Law Center is a non-profit organization 

that has been working since 1972 to advance and protect women's 

legal rights. The Center focuses on major policy areas of 

importance to women and their families including economic 

security, education, employment and health, with special 

attention given to the concerns of low-income women. </i></font></p>
