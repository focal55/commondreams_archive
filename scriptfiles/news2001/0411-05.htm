- April 11 - The Interfaith Alliance Foundation (TIAF) today announced the winners of the third annual <em>Walter Cronkite Faith & Freedom Award</em> to be presented May 3 in New York City. Rep. Chet Edwards, representative for the 11th Congressional District of Texas, and Rabbi Steven Jacobs of Temple Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills, Calif., will be honored during an award ceremony and luncheon at the Yale Club.

 

<p>At the first award ceremony Walter Cronkite said, "We should never lose sight of the fact that faith and freedom are precious liberties that must be vigorously protected and defended in a manner that strengthens - not undermines - the integral role of faith in the life of our nation."

<p>Established in 1998, the <em>Walter Cronkite Faith & Freedom Award</em> recognizes individuals whose work and actions have embodied the shared religious values of civility, tolerance, mutual respect and compassion when addressing controversial and divisive issues. The award seeks to encourage people of faith and goodwill to stand up for religious freedom and to demonstrate the healing and constructive force of religion in public life.

"Congressman Edwards and Rabbi Jacobs exemplify the powerful impact people of faith can have on our society through their unrelenting commitment to protecting the religious and civil rights of all," said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of TIAF. "They are unsung heroes in our midst, courageously working to protect and defend the essential liberties of democracy with integrity and a mutual respect for the human dignity of all people."

</p>

Representative Chet Edwards

<p>First elected in 1990 to serve the 11th Congressional District of Texas, Rep. Edwards has worked tirelessly to defend the institutional separation of religion and government on Capitol Hill. During the past year, he has led efforts to raise awareness and educate fellow members of Congress on the dangers of government funding religion as proposed in the "Charitable Choice" provisions of several bills. Edwards has spoken out against the little-understood initiative that allows pervasively sectarian organizations to receive tax funds.  He has raised concerns about promoting government-funded religious discrimination, compromising the prophetic voice of religious leaders, undermining the integrity of both religious and government institutions and threatening the civil and religious rights of the most vulnerable in our society.  Edwards has been a leader over the past several years in defending the institutional separation of religion and government on Capitol Hill, advancing his views with courage and civility.

</p>

Rabbi Steven Jacobs

<p>Over the past year, Rabbi Steven Jacobs has been a major leader in promoting interfaith dialogue, racial justice and labor rights both nationally and in his community of Los Angeles.  When violence in the Middle East began to escalate, Jacobs worked with others to establish dialogue between Muslims and Jews in Southern California.  In the aftermath of the 2000 elections, he worked with civil rights leaders to mobilize the Jewish and African-American communities to address voting irregularities, organizing public events nationwide.  In an effort to raise awareness about poverty and the working poor, Rabbi Jacobs was the chief author and coordinator of "To Fulfill the Dream: An End to Poverty for Workers - A Declaration of Conscience from the Religious Community in Los Angeles."  

<p>The honorees were selected by the Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award Selection Committee.  Members of the Committee include: the <strong>Rev. Joan Brown Campbell</strong>, immediate past general secretary of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA; the <strong>Honorable Gerald R. Ford</strong>, 38th president of the United States; the <strong>Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy</strong>, executive director of TIAF; the <strong>Honorable John Lewis</strong>, member of Congress, 5th Congressional District of Georgia; <strong>Bill Moyers</strong>, journalist, Public Affairs Television; <strong>Elie Wiesel</strong>, professor, Boston University, Nobel Peace Laureate, 1986; and the <strong>Honorable Andrew Young</strong>, chairman, Goodworks, International, LLC.

<p>Last year's award recipients included: <strong>Tom Brokaw</strong>, for calling attention to and raising appreciation for the values of liberty, integrity, diversity, compassion and community responsibility through authoring the book, "The Greatest Generation"; <strong>Vandani Bhagani Kusum Patel</strong>, for her role in bringing together neighbors from diverse religious backgrounds to respond to the tragic violence perpetrated by the hate-induced killing spree of Benjamin Smith during the summer of 1999; and the <strong>Rev. Dr. James C. Miller</strong>, executive minister of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, for his work bringing together local Imams, Orthodox priests and Rabbis to help bring comfort and closure to those who mourned the victims of EgyptAir flight 990.
