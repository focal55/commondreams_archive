<LI>HOWARD ZINN, <A HREF="mailto:hzinn@bu.edu">hzinn@bu.edu</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tompaine.com/opinion/2001/09/13/1.html" target="_new">www.tompaine.com/opinion/2001/09/13/1.html</A>,

A renowned historian who has authored numerous books

including <I>A People's History of the United States</I>, Zinn was a

bombardier during World War II. He said today: "The images on television

horrified and sickened me. Then our political leaders came on television, and I

was horrified and sickened again. They spoke of retaliation, of vengeance, of

punishment. I thought: they have learned nothing, absolutely nothing, from the

history of the 20th century, from a hundred years of retaliation, vengeance,

war, a hundred years of terrorism and counter-terrorism, of violence met with

violence in an unending cycle of stupidity. Will we now bomb Afghanistan, and

inevitably kill innocent people, because it is in the nature of bombing to be

indiscriminate? Will we then be committing terrorism in order to 'send a

message' to terrorists? Yes, it is an old way of thinking, and we need new

ways. A $300 billion military budget has not given us security. Military bases

all over the world, our warships on every ocean, have not given us security.

Land mines, a 'missile defense,' will not give us security. We need to imagine

that the awful scenes of death and suffering we are witnessing have been going

on in other parts of the world for a long time, and only now can we begin to

know what people have gone through, often as a result of our policies. We need

to decide that we will not go to war, whatever reason is conjured up by the

politicians or the media, because war in our time is always indiscriminate, a

war against innocents, a war against children. War is terrorism, magnified a

hundred times."

<P><LI>KEVIN GRAY, <A HREF="mailto:kagamba@bellsouth.net">kagamba@bellsouth.net</A><BR>

An activist and contributing editor to <I>Black News</I> in

Columbia, S.C., Gray is working on a book entitled <I>The Death of Black

Politics</I>. He said today: "People who feel hopeless fly into

buildings. And now we're going to get mad and kill them. Well, they're already

willing to die -- they're already dead. People have focused on the who, what,

where and how -- but we need to ask and think about the why. U.S. policies have

caused enormous levels of death and destruction around the world. From

Nicaragua to Chile to Iraq to Cuba to Palestine to Timor to Cambodia to any

number of other places, one clearly sees the callousness with which U.S.

policies treat the lives and property of especially non-white peoples. A

declaration of war will -- rather than reducing the threat of terrorism --

eliminate basic civil liberties and strengthen the existing tendency toward a

racist and classist police state."

<P><LI>JULES LOBEL, <A HREF="mailto:lobel@law.pitt.edu">lobel@law.pitt.edu</A><BR>

Professor of constitutional and international law at the

University of Pittsburgh, Lobel co-wrote the <I>Yale International Law Journal</I>

article "The Use of Force to Respond to Terrorist Attacks -- The

Afghanistan and Sudan Bombing." He said today: "We live in a culture

of violence. I was in a courtroom arguing about how to deal with violent

inmates when the judge told us of the attacks. I spent hours wondering if my

sister -- who worked on the 50th story of the WTC -- was safe. I thought about

whether our bombing another country and killing people would give her possible

death meaning. It was an empty feeling. When our leaders talk of a disproportionate

response that would inevitably kill many civilians -- what exactly

distinguishes that response from this heinous act? The only hope is if this

tragedy forces us to re-evaluate our role in the world."
