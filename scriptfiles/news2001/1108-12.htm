Senators Expected to Call for Accelerated Confirmation Schedule</font>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - November 8 - Earthjustice called 

today's expected push from some members of Congress to accelerate 

the judicial nomination process, &quot;flawed thinking and a dangerous 

precedent.&quot; At news conferences scheduled for today, several 

Senators, including Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), and 

Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are expected to call for rushing through 

judicial nominees in the name of national security. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no real threat to national security in making sure 

that each life-long appointee is the right choice for the job,&quot; 

said Glenn Sugameli, senior legislative counsel for Earthjustice. 

&quot;The nomination process for judges should not be compromised, and 

it's shameless that some in Congress might be attempting to use 

current events to achieve that goal.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sugameli points out that the Senate Judiciary Committee is 

continuing to address judicial confirmations at a reasonable pace. 

The committee has paid special attention to district court nominees 

who would be most directly affected by any terrorism-related 

issues. In addition, magistrate judges who handle warrants and 

other key issues are not subject to Senate confirmations and are 

currently in place in sufficient numbers. Appeals court judges 

would not have the opportunity to hear terrorist-related cases for 

many months, if not years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The real danger would be a rush to judgement on lifetime 

judicial nominees who will decide whether to strike down or enforce 

safety, health, and environmental protections,&quot; said Sugameli. &quot;The 

Senate is acting responsibly by approving judges after carefully 

considering each nominee's record on critical environmental and 

other issues.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once confirmed, federal judges hold their positions for life, 

suggesting that rash confirmations could be especially damaging. 

Environmental groups place particular importance on a sensible 

approach to reviewing nominees for the federal bench. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For decades to come, newly confirmed judges will exert 

tremendous influence over the laws that protect our public health 

and environment,&quot; Sugameli said. &quot;The confirmations should not be 

approached hastily.&quot; </font></p>
