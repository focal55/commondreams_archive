- June 13 - The General Board of 

Church and Society of the United Methodist Church is working to 

defeat the nuclear missile defense system. President Bush is a 

member of the United Methodist Church. The church's 67 bishops have 

unanimously approved a strongly worded statement urging the defeat 

of President Bush's proposed strategic missile defense system. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bishops' statement follows the passage of a resolution by 

The General Conference of the United Methodist Church calling for 

an end to the development of the missile defense system. Citing the 

threat to world security and peace presented by the proposed 

system, the Church's General Board of Church and Society (GBCS) 

plans to deploy staff, gather volunteers, create a web site, lobby 

members of Congress and establish a vigorous program to reach the 

Church's 12 million members worldwide. Since one of those members 

is President George W. Bush, the actions of the Bishops, the 

General Conference, the United Methodist General Board of Church 

and Society are especially significant. All other national 

religious bodies will be invited by The General Board of Church and 

Society to join their efforts to defeat the missile defense system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concerns about &quot;Star Wars II&quot; as articulated by GBCS, go far 

beyond the complaints of the system's unworkability and 

astronomical costs. Because of the great vulnerability of the 

weapons being considered (including lasers and interceptors in 

space, in the air, and at sea), they would be useless to an 

innocent nation waiting to be attacked. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Potentially useful to an aggressor with the element of surprise 

on its side, the weapon's primary uses are all offensive, including 

destroying opposing satellites, seizing military control of space, 

and attacking targets on the surface of the earth from space 

without warning. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Methodist Bishops in their resolution call upon all 

people of goodwill to join actively in the struggle to achieve 

peace with justice. Appealing to President Bush and Congress to 

refrain from the development of a national missile defense system, 

the Bishops state, &quot;We must join together to see that the untold 

billions of dollars proposed for a meaningless search for security 

through a national missile defense system are not once again taken 

from the mouths of children and the poor.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Only the General Conference speaks for the entire denomination. 

The General Board of Church and Society is the international public 

policy and social action agency of The United Methodist Church. </i></font></p>
