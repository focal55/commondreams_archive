- August 23 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is issuing an appeal for contributions to help alleviate widespread hunger problems caused by drought in Central America. Three months of little or no rain has destroyed crops in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Hardest hit are the people in the rural areas who rely on their small farms to feed themselves. Estimates from the World Food Program indicate that 300,00 people in Honduras, 200,000 in El Salvador, 100,000 in Nicaragua, and 60,000 in Guatemala face critical food shortages and are at risk. AFSC field staff in Honduras and Nicaragua confirm that pockets of people are in urgent need of food in those countries. Another complicating factor is that people have had to consume seeds set aside for the planting of the next crop in September, making the situation a possible long-term catastrophe. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The children are eating green bananas, avocados, and at times just fruit,&quot; said Trinidad S&aacute;nchez, AFSC's Central America Field Representative based in Honduras. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The hunger is most severe in the coffee growing regions because people are landless and there was no work this year for pickers due to low coffee prices,&quot; stated Jennifer Atlee-Loudon, AFSC's Central America Co-Quaker International Affairs Representative based in Managua, Nicaragua. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC staff in Central America is drawing on the organization's substantial experience and contacts in the region. &quot;We have staff on the ground,&quot; explained David Bronkema, AFSC program coordinator for Central America. &quot;We have programs and networks in the United States interested in the region who are asking us to respond as well. AFSC can use all of these resources to help people not covered by other agencies. &quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC has worked in Central America for more than 50 years, accompanying people in the challenges of war and processes of peace and reconciliation as well as in long-term economic and social justice projects. AFSC has also engaged in substantial disaster relief and reconstruction work in this area of the world, most recently in Honduras after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and in El Salvador after the severe earthquakes earlier this year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFSC is releasing $5,000 from its Crisis Fund to the COMAL network in Honduras, directed by AFSC's Trinidad S&aacute;nchez, in response to that organization's request for assistance. COMAL is a community marketing network made up of more than 30 member organizations running more than 400 community stores in the rural areas of that country. AFSC will also be working with partner organizations in the other countries to purchase food, seeds, and tools and build water irrigation systems to meet immediate needs and at the same time build long-term solutions. </font></p>
