- November 8 - The Federal Election Commission

(FEC) today issued an opinion recognizing the Green

Party of the United States as the National Committee

of the Green Party.  The decision, in response to a

request to the FEC from the Green Party in August,

follows the Green Party's ground-breaking 2000

campaigns, including the national campaigns of Ralph

Nader and Winona LaDuke for President and Vice

President.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The decision of the FEC adds to the enormous momentum

the Green Party now enjoys,&quot; said Dean Myerson, Green

Party Political Coordinator.  &quot;We are running more

candidates, electing more candidates, gaining more

members and support.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the party's annual meeting in Santa Barbara,

California last July, Green delegates voted to

establish a national party and to apply to the FEC for

national committee status. Delegates also approved

growth plans that include opening an office in

Washington, D.C. and hiring a team of field organizers

for the mid-term election season. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;National Committee status is a tremendous

accomplishment for the young party, one that

acknowledges its place as the leading and fastest

growing political alternative in the United States,&quot;

added David Cobb, General Counsel for the Green Party

of the United States.  &quot;It will help increase the

numbers of voters who recognize us as the party of

change, a serious contender on the political

landscape.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Committee status will permit the Green Party

to accept contributions up to $20,000 per year from

individuals, but internal Green Party rules cap such

donations at $10,000 per year.  The party and its

candidates also refuse contributions from

corporations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Green Party is the only political party to oppose

the big money that is corrupting politics in America,&quot;

said Steve Schmidt, chair of the party's Platform

Committee.  &quot;We're the only party that chooses to

regulate itself more strictly than the federal

government.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party has called for a measured and just

response to the September 11 attacks, demanding that

the U.S. avoid further civilian deaths and continue to

protect civil liberties and our constitutional rights

of dissent, free assembly, privacy, due process, and

mobility.  The Republican and Democratic Parties

continue to retreat from supporting such protections.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The attacks were a crime against humanity, and Greens

call for the culprits to be brought to justice in an

appropriate international court of law,&quot; said Annie

Goeke, a Pennsylvania Green and chair of the

International Committee of the Green Party of the

United States.  &quot;The current war mentality threatens

to undermine our rights and cause needless deaths,

abroad and possibly even here in the U.S.  It will

prove ineffective in stopping terrorism.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States is the national

political organization of the Greens, in which 33

states are represented, with other states' memberships

pending.  It organized the Green National Convention

in Denver in June, 2000, at which Ralph Nader was

nominated to run for President, and is recognized

among Green Parties around the world.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media inquiries about national policies and activities

of the Green Party should be directed to the Green

Party of the United States, through its media

representatives as listed in the heading above. To
