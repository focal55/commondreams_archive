- June 25 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marcia D. Greenberger, NWLC Co-President, will present testimony 

about the role of judicial philosophy in the judicial confirmation 

process before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Administrative 

Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee on June 26 at 10 a.m. 

Greenberger will testify on a panel that includes Harvard law 

professor Laurence Tribe and University of Chicago law professor 

Cass R. Sunstein. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenberger's testimony is expected to focus on the history and 

Constitutional basis for the Senate's active and independent role 

in giving its &quot;advice and consent&quot; to the nomination of federal 

judges, a role that is co-equal with the President's; the standards 

that Senators should apply in considering judicial nominees; and 

the rights and liberties that are at stake. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Dating back to George Washington's time, a judicial nominee's 

judicial philosophy has been an important area of inquiry at Senate 

confirmation hearings,&quot; Greenberger will tell the Committee. 

&quot;Federal judges are appointed with lifetime tenure and the scrutiny 

they receive during the confirmation process is the only real form 

of accountability that our system provides for them.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For women -- and in fact, all Americans -- the federal courts 

over the last 30 years have allowed important advances in 

employment, education, health, safety and welfare through their 

interpretations of the equal protection and privacy guarantees of 

the Constitution and federal statutes. Yet, many of these 

guarantees now hang in the balance on a closely divided Supreme 

Court. Greenberger will urge Senators to satisfy themselves that 

each judicial nominee not only meets high standards of character, 

experience, legal excellence and temperament, but also that he or 

she demonstrates a commitment to the core principles that protect 

and advance women's legal rights and other key legal protections 

for American citizens. </font></p>
