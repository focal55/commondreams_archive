- May 24 - &quot;Feminists are optimistic that the change in Senate leadership following Sen.

Jeffords' departure from the Republican party will help keep women's rights intact,&quot; said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Patricia

Ireland.&quot;Although Jeffords' switch doesn't alter the vote count in favor of abortion

rights, the change-over in leadership from ultraconservatives clutches is

monumental.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;One of the most crucial results of Jeffords' decision will be the ousting of

Orrin Hatch from his position as Chair of the Judiciary Committee,&quot; Ireland

said. &quot;With Patrick Leahy as his successor, recommendations from this

committee

on judicial nominees are sure to be less conservative and more supportive of

women's and other civil rights. You can bet that any recommendations coming

out

of Leahy's Judiciary Committee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court

will

support Roe v. Wade, whereas under Hatch, they were sure not to.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sen. Jeffords' decision to depart from the Republican Party should be a

wake-up call to right-wing members of Congress,&quot; Ireland said. &quot;The game of

rolling-back rights and disregarding public interest is not something that the

formerly Republican lawmaker wanted to play. The days of ultraconservatives

gloating over holding both houses of Congress are over.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Jeffords' bold move highlights the importance of the 2002 elections and

suggests that the political climate is right for moving beyond politics as

usual,&quot; Ireland said. &quot;NOW activists have already begun making plans to elect

feminists to all levels of government and will fine tune these skills at NOW's

upcoming Political Institute. This Institute, part of the National NOW

Conference (June 29 to July 1 in Philadelphia), will train activists to select

and elect women's rights supporters and wrest power from the

ultraconservatives.&quot;</font></p>
