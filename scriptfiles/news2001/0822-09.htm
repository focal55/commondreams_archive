- August 22 - Acclaimed folksinger Dar Williams has joined a line-up of

hosts Roz and Howard Larman of Folkscene and Juan Gonzalez former co-host 

Democracy Now! in support of the Free Pacifica Lawsuits and the Pacifica 

Campaign.

Dar is not new to the 'Free Pacifica Radio' movement, she performed at 

several benefits in the Bay Area. "That New York station, WBAI, totally 

radicalized my adolescence," she told the San Francisco Chronicle earlier 

this year. "I could tune in and find things no one else was playing. The 

Berkeley station (KPFA) serves the same function." 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Thousands of Pacifica Radio listener-sponsors from across the nation have 

organized to reclaim the Pacifica Foundation from a ‘corporate clique’ that 

critics say have taken over the progressive radio network founded over 50 

years ago. In the past five years close to 150 volunteers and staff have been 

purged, fired or driven out of Pacifica’s KPFK 90.7 FM in Los Angeles. 

Pacifica Radio is a network of five community radio stations in whose signals 

are capable of reaching over one in five American households and have an 

aggregate market value of half a billion dollars.

Background: The Free Pacifica Lawsuits (<a href="http://www.savepacifica.net/legal.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.savepacifica.net/legal.html</a>)

 addresses by-laws changes made in late 90’s by the Pacifica Foundation 

National Board of Directors (PNB) drastically revised its by-laws, removing 

the rights of member station Local Advisory Boards (LABs) to elect a majority 

of the PNB, and instead granting the PNB exclusive control over its own 

membership. These changes, along with the PNB's refusal to observe its own 

by-laws, the use of Foundation funds for purposes contrary to those expressed 

in its Articles of Incorporation, and violation of its charitable trust, are 

being challenged in CA Superior court by lawsuits brought by members of LABs, 

two groups of directors of the Foundation (5 of the present 11 member board), 

and a group of listeners on behalf of the CA Attorney General.

The Pacifica Campaign (<a href="http://www.pacificacampaign.org" TARGET="_blank">http://www.pacificacampaign.org</a>) is a nationwide 

grassroots campaign representing thousands of listener-sponsors and staff of 

the Pacifica Radio Network's stations and affiliate stations. The Campaign is 

calling for the resignation of some members of the Pacifica National Board 

who have formed a ruling majority and who, by their actions and policies, are 

dismantling the network and its intended mission. 

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In recent months the Pacifica Campaign and a broad network of allied activist 

groups have held public education campaigns about their actions, engaged them 

in direct peaceful confrontations, and coordinated pickets and direct 

peaceful interventions in public forums and workplaces of the employers of 

the renegade board members. The Campaign call s for a complete boycott of 

funding to the Pacifica National Board until its mission has been restored. 

To date, the Pacifica Campaign has obtained the resignations of four board 

members and the withdrawal of two nominees that the renegade board majority 

has attempted to elect to replace those who have resigned.</font></p>
