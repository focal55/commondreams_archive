- February 16 - The trial of the D.C. Democracy Seven, arrested for 

protesting Congressional oppression of the District of Columbia last summer, 

concluded at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, February 15 at D.C. Superior Court with 

&quot;not guilty&quot; verdicts for all seven defendants.  Each defendant faced a 

maximum penalty of six months in jail and/or a $500 fine.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mood in the courtroom as the verdicts were read was relatively calm. 

Defendant Steve Donkin said, &quot;If the government thinks it can intimidate DC 

residents by prosecuting these cases, then it better think again, because 

we're going to keep coming after them until the people of D.C. get the same 

rights as other Americans.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This trial was the second resulting from an incident on July 26, 2000, when 

Donkin, Martin Thomas, Karen Szulgit, Tanya Snyder, Queen Mother ShemaYah, 

Debby Hanrahan and Bette Hoover were arrested in the U.S. House of 

Representatives Visitors' Gallery for allegedly chanting &quot;D.C. Votes No! 

Free D.C.!&quot; during a Congressional vote on the District of Columbia 

Appropriations Bill. At the Seven's first trial last October, prosecutors 

dismissed without explanation charges faced by Thomas. The remaining six 

defendants went to trial and received a hung jury, at which point the judge 

declared a mistrial and government prosecutor Lopez immediately asked for a 

new trial.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the two days of testimony in the current trial, the prosecution 

called upon two U.S. Capitol Hill police officers to testify and showed a 

C-SPAN videotape of the alleged disruption to the jury.  Non-voting Delegate 

Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) testified for the defense that Congressional 

proceedings were never disrupted by the &quot;commotion&quot; in the Visitors' Gallery 

that day.  She also testified extensively about her role in Congress as a 

non-voting delegate, particularly as it applies to her inability to have any 

influence on the process by which Congress annually approves D.C.'s budget.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The jurors deliberated for three hours on Wednesday afternoon and returned 

on Thursday morning for two more hours of discussion.  In the only 

interruption of deliberations, the jurors asked Judge Blackburn-Rigsby to 

clarify the definition of Congress being &quot;in session.&quot;  They were referred 

by the judge back to her instructions to the jury, and further instructed to 

&quot;rely on the evidence presented.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Appropriations Bill enables Congress to control the city's budget, 

the domain of municipal authorities in all other U.S. cities, and also 

includes riders that overturn locally passed legislation. These riders have 

prohibited D.C. from enacting Initiative 59, passed overwhelmingly by D.C. 

voters in 1998, which would allow use of medical marijuana by patients with 

serious and terminal illnesses.  The riders also  have gutted other programs 

passed by the city's voters, including D.C.'s locally funded needle exchange 

program designed to control the spread of HIV.  Also they have restricted 

use of local money to fund family planning for low-income women; and 

prohibited use of city funds to sue Congress for D.C. voting rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attorney Paul R. Hurst of Steptoe &amp; Johnson, LLP, joined the defendants' 

legal team, which also included attorneys Reginald Williamson and Veda M. 

Carney, both of whom represented defendants pro bono at the last trial. 

Defendants and defense attorneys are available for interviews.  More 

information is available by calling Steve Donkin at 202-986-9438 or by
