- May 17 - Over 20 community radio stations from coast to coast have signed on to carry the daily news cast, *Free Speech Radio News* (FSRN). Even more stations are expected in the coming days. The half-hour alternative news program, featuring the best of progressive reporting from around the country and around the world, was first created by dozens of freelance reporters who struck Pacifica Network News (PNN) last year. FSRN's pool of reporters now numbers over 90, hailing from 20 American states and 6 continents.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the support of the Campaign to Stop the Corporate Takeover Of Pacifica, FSRN will broadcast daily for one month beginning May 18th, 2001. The show will uplink to a satellite at 4:00 p.m., Eastern time.  The coordinates are A72.7M.  It will also be posted on the strikers' web site at www.fsrn.org.  Since February of last year, the cast has aired once weekly on 45 community stations nationally (most are Pacifica affiliates). The cast is also broadcast through the Independent Media Center and throughout the shortwave world on Radio for Peace International.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Returning to community broadcasting, former veteran Pacifica Network News host Verna Avery-Brown will anchor the extended cast. When she resigned from PNN after eleven years in December, 1999, Avery-Brown was the only African-American, national-news anchor in public broadcasting. Promotional carts recorded by Avery-Brown will be available on the strike site, which stations can download.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cast will feature daily national headlines, along with a number of breaking investigative reports.  Investigations will include Rupert Cook from Kigali, Rwanda on the controversies surrounding U.S. drug companies and AIDS medications, and a report from Emily Bernhardt in Maine on the controversial new U.S.-Navy sonar that harms animals and humans. Listeners can also expect reports from Seattle, Belgrade, the West Bank and Gaza, Mexico City, New York, Los Angeles and South Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FSRN will be produced out of Washington D.C., San Francisco and Tampa. Aaron Glantz will produce the cast, Randi Zimmerman will be Headlines Editor. FSRN will also collaborate with the Independent Media Center in New York, for critical New York production support.</font></p>
