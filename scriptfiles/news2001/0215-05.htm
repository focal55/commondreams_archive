- February 15 - Michigan Citizen Action, the state's largest membership-based watchdog group, today released a report

saying that the Bush administration's proposed tax cuts aimed at the wealthy would drain Federal funding

away from a comprehensive Medicare prescription-drug benefit for all seniors.</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The report -- <EM>Bad Policy, Bad Medicine: Bush Plans for Taxes and Prescription Drugs Unfair To Working

Families and Seniors</EM> -- was produced by MCA's parent organization USAction and Citizens for Tax

Justice. It points out that Bush's plan would give the richest 1% of Americans $563,000 each over ten

years.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "A narrow slice of the population -- the wealthiest 1%, whose incomes average over one million dollars -

would receive almost 43% of the total tax cut," said Bob McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "Why is the Bush administration creating a $774 billion tax giveaway for one million millionaires and

depriving 39 million seniors of the Medicare prescription drug coverage they deserve? This is outrageous

and irresponsible at a time when seniors are being ripped off by drug companies," said William McNary,

president of USAction.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> That amount, plus the ten-year cost of Bush's inadequate "Immediate Helping Hand" drug proposal, is

more than enough to pay for a truly comprehensive Medicare prescription drug plan covering all seniors

and having enough purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By contrast, Bush's drug proposal would cover only the 1% of Medicare beneficiaries who spend over

$6,000 per year out of pocket. It also fails to address the high cost of prescription drugs.</font></P>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> MCA executive director Linda Teeter echoes the report's starting and ending question: "In evaluating the

Bush tax proposal, Congress and the public face a stark choice: Does America need a huge tax cut for

those at the very top of the income scale? Or would we prefer a comprehensive prescription drug plan for

seniors?"</font></P>
