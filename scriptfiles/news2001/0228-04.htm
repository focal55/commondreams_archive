<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOUSTON - February 28 -  Dozens of free speech activists will descend upon 



Houston this weekend to face off against the board of directors 



of the Pacifica Foundation, which runs the only independent radio 



network in the United States. Activists plan teach-ins and protests 



during the board meeting, which is the first since the board 



authorized a hostile take-over of WBAI-FM in New York City.





<p>"Quite simply, the Pacifica board has been hijacked by a small 



clique that has more in common with corporate vultures than with 



working-class America. That clique has illegally changed the 



Foundation's by-laws, and during the past two years it has 



methodically sought to squash dissent throughout the network. 



This group does not respect free speech. It does not respect 



labor or civil rights. It does not even practice due process for 



its own managers. And it is now seeking to radically alter 



Pacifica's by-laws to pave the way for the selling of one or 



more stations," said Juan Gonzalez, an award-winning Pacifica 



reporter who resigned on-air and started a corporate campaign 



to oust the Pacifica leadership. Gonzalez will be in Houston 



this weekend as will fired journalists from WBAI.





<p>The Pacifica Foundation is a nonprofit organization that 



controls the licenses of five radio stations: WPFW in Washington, 



DC, WBAI in NY, KPFA in Berkeley, KPFT in Houston, and KPFK in 



Los Angeles. Over 85% of its revenues come from listeners.





<p>Pacifica's leaders have come under fire in recent months for 



staging a hostile take-over of WBAI radio in New York City in 



December 2000, firing the station1s general manager and program 



director, and banning several long-time station staff from 



entering the station. The board authorized similar actions at 



Berkeley1s KPFA in July 1999, when it used armed guards to close 



down KPFA for several weeks. At its board meeting this weekend, 



the board may consider a proposal to change its bylaws to allow 



a small group of board members to sell off KPFA or WBAI.





<p>In response to Pacifica's actions, listeners, station board 



members, and several dissenting national board members have 



filed lawsuits against the Foundation. Pacifica's freelance 



reporters are on strike, demanding an end to censorship and a 



return to the network's progressive values. And listeners 



throughout the United States have conducted a relentless campaign 



of protest against the organization's board members, including 



numerous acts of non-violent civil disobedience and a boycott of 



Pacifica1s recent fund drive.





<p>Following is the schedule of protest events planned during the 



Pacifica Foundation board meeting:
