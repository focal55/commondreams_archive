Funds will help purchase vital supplies, including blankets, sheets, food and medicines. In conjunction with Life for Relief and Development, a Detroit-based Islamic relief organization, EMAP is initiating a 3-week field assessment of the situation in the region. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Afghanistan is a small country where an estimated three million people are refugees,&quot; states Carlos Mejia, director of the AFSC Emergency and Material Assistance Program (EMAP). &quot;This represents one of the largest refugee population in the world, yet their plight was virtually ignored until the terrible September 11 U.S. tragedies.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 20-year war has ravaged this poor country, leaving Afghanistan's per capita income among the lowest in the world. Its infant mortality rate - approximately 200 deaths per 1,000 infants - is among the world's highest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The outpouring of love and support that has been expressed for survivors and victims of the September 11 tragedies has been overwhelming,&quot; Mejia states. &quot;We hope the American public will continue to respond to this appeal for the people of Afghanistan, who are themselves victims of these atrocities.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Emergency and Material Assistance Program (EMAP), now in its 80th year of operation, provides material assistance to those in need in this country and abroad. Materials include clothing, medical supplies, seeds, Friend-Ship Kits, and other requested items. The program receives volunteer support to collect, sort, and pack donations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the national center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, EMAP has regional centers in Baltimore, Maryland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; High Point, North Carolina; Richmond, Indiana; and San Francisco, California. </font></p>
