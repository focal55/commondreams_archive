- May 17 - The President's plan won't produce affordable energy for 

Americans now, or 10 years from now. What the President's plan 

will do is drive up air pollution in our cities and turn the last 

5 percent of our public lands that we've protected for future 

generations over to the oil and coal companies. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush's message to California is: 'drop dead.' 

Although constantly talking about California's problems, the 

President has not proposed one measure to help the state cope with 

the fallout from electricity deregulation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's plan chooses the most expensive energy over the 

cheapest, time after time. The plan would perpetuate higher energy 

prices for consumers: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gasoline produced from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would 

cost 16 percent more than any other domestic source if it were to 

come to market 10 years from now. Electricity generated from 

nuclear power is over 40 percent more expensive than power from any 

other source. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing in the President's plan will deliver more energy any 

time soon: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Arctic oil wouldn't be available for 10 years, in 2011. 

-- Oil and natural gas from protected areas in the West wouldn't 

reach consumers for four to eight years -- 2005 to 2009. 

-- A new nuclear plant -- or even expansion of an old one -- 

takes five to 10 years, if it is to be built safely. Unless safety 

reviews are going to be short-circuited, nuclear power capacity 

can't come on line until 2006 to 2011. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even without the President's plan, energy prices are projected 

to drop: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Natural gas wellhead prices are already projected to drop 70 

percent from their January 2001 high by 2004, while residential 

natural gas prices are projected to drop 30 percent over the same 

time period and continue to fall through 2010, according to Energy 

Information Agency (EIA). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Oil prices are projected to drop 34 percent from their 

November 2000 high by 2003-2004 (from $30.30 per barrel to $20.08 

per barrel). According to EIA the projected price for gasoline in 

2010 is $1.29 per gallon. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's now clear why the President walked away from his campaign 

commitment to cut power plant global warming pollution. The 

President's energy plan will increase global warming pollution from 

power plants alone by approximately 65 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President's directive that the Department of Justice 

&quot;review&quot; New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act 

constitutes a sweeping attack on the heart and lungs of the law. 

The NSR program requires broad emission reductions from every 

sector of our economy: power plants, refiners, manufacturing, and 

more. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As applied to power plants alone over the next several years NSR 

will require an additional 9 million tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2) 

reductions annually and an additional 3 million tons of nitrogen 

oxides (NOx) reductions annually. If these cuts are not allowed 

to proceed as a result of the President's 'review,' we can 

anticipate continued death, disease, and acid rain damage from 

sulfur emissions and more smog conditions that bring unhealthy air 

to over 140 million Americans each year.
