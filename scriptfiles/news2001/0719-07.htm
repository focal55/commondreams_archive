- July 19 - As leaders of the G-8 countries gather in Genoa, the following policy 

analysts are available for interviews:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ELLEN FRANK, <a href="mailto:frank@emmanuel.edu">frank@emmanuel.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.dollarsandsense.org" target="new">http://www.dollarsandsense.org</a><br>

Author of the forthcoming book &quot;Money Illusion&quot; and a professor of 

economics at Emmanuel College in Boston, Frank said today: &quot;The U.S. is 

sliding into a recession, Europe is stagnant, Japan is in a depression. 

Argentina and other major developing countries face debt problems that are 

insurmountable without a coordinated international response.... We sit on 

the brink of a serious world economic crisis that will require imaginative 

and thoroughgoing policy coordination between the major countries. But the 

political will to undertake such serious action seems nowhere in evidence. 

The leaders of the G-8 will likely agree to write off a few more billion 

dollars in already-bad loans to the poorer nations, but they are unlikely 

to fully address the serious economic issues before us -- the collapse of 

world demand, the irrational and speculative financial system, 

environmental problems of a global nature.&quot;</font></p>

Coordinator of the World Bank Bond Boycott, Watkins is in Genoa.</font></p>

Vanderslice, outreach coordinator of the Jubilee USA Network, said today: &quot;We applaud President Bush and Secretary O'Neill's support of grants for 

developing countries instead of loans. They acknowledge exactly what we 

have been saying -- that these countries' debts are unpayable and the 

current debt relief initiatives have not gone far enough. All 23 countries 

that have received debt relief are still paying more on debt service than 

on health for their citizens. Africa is paying out $13 billion annually in 

debt service payments, forcing countries there to cut back on health care 

and education.... Voices for full debt cancellation from the World Bank and 

IMF have included the bipartisan Meltzer congressional commission and the 

key Vatican committee on the issue. G-7 nations, which basically control 

the IMF and World Bank, should have those institutions stop taking the 

money and cancel the debt now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADAM TAYLOR, <a href="mailto:adamtaylorgj@hotmail.com">adamtaylorgj@hotmail.com</a>, <a href="http://www.stopglobalaids.org" target="new">http://www.stopglobalaids.org</a><br>

Executive director of Global Justice, a new student organization, Taylor 

said today: &quot;Bush's statement that he wants to increase the amount of 

grants made to developing countries from the World Bank rings hollow since 

the U.S. gives the least of all the wealthy countries -- about 0.1 percent 

of our GDP goes to foreign assistance. The $200 million pledged by the 

administration for the UN Global Health Fund so far is a pittance of what 

is needed and sends the wrong signal to other potential donors. AIDS 

exposes other deeper inequalities our world is faced with, including a lack 

of respect for human rights, deepening poverty and debt.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PAUL DAVIS, <a href="mailto:pdavis@critpath.org">pdavis@critpath.org</a>, <a href="http://www.healthgap.org" target="new">http://www.healthgap.org</a><br>

Coordinator of domestic government affairs for the Health Gap Coalition and 

a member of ACT UP Philadelphia, Davis said today: &quot;At a recent WTO 

meeting, almost all rich nations joined with the countries of the South in 

asking the WTO to reform its drug monopoly rules so that affordable 

generics could quickly become available to address the devastation caused 

by the AIDS epidemic. The representative of Pope John Paul stated that 'The 

law of profit alone cannot be applied to that which is essential for the 

fight against hunger, disease and poverty. Hence, whenever there is a 

conflict between property rights, on the one hand, and fundamental human 

rights and concerns of the common good, on the other, property rights 

should be moderated...' Only the U.S. opposed this.&quot;</font></p>
