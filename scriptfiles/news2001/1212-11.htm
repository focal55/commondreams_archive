<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- December 12 - With the release of the 

latest in a line of National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reports 

dating back to the 1972 that warn of the potentially devastating 

environmental and health effects of global climate change, 

Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), called on President 

Bush today to take urgent action to prevent a climate catastrophe. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There can be no higher priority for our nation's security and 

the health of the planet than curbing global climate change,&quot; said 

PSR's Executive Director and CEO, Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H. 

&quot;This NAS report should be the last wake up call the Bush 

Administration needs. To not respond with action is to risk 

American security and the public's health.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new NAS report, Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises, 

states that &quot;greenhouse warming and other human alterations of the 

earth system may increase the possibility of large, abrupt, and 

unwelcome regional and global climatic events.&quot; The report goes on 

to warn that, &quot;because climate change will likely continue in the 

coming decades, denying the likelihood or downplaying the relevance 

of past abrupt events could be costly.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NAS report is a departure from previous warnings in 

underscoring the possibility of larger and more sudden changes than 

have generally been predicted including sudden snaps in average 

global temperature of up to 10 degrees C. Such a change would be 

even larger than the shift from the Ice Age to the current world 

climate system that has supported the development of human 

agriculture, civilization, and adaptation to disease. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A series of PSR reports called Death by Degrees has already 

documented in detail the potential for climate change to affect 

human society and health. Higher temperatures and increased weather 

activity can cause an increase in heat-related illness and death, 

worsen air quality with increasing cases of respiratory illness 

such as asthma, decrease water quantity and diminish water quality, 

and affect the spread of insect populations that carry diseases 

such as malaria and dengue fever. Additional effects from sea level 

rise, flooding and drought can affect human settlements and food 

production globally and may produce large numbers of refugees 

subject to further disease and civil unrest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now is the time for the Bush Administration to admit that it 

needs to work with the Senate to develop a new energy plan. The 

U.S. needs invest in responsible energy strategies that will curb 

greenhouse gas emissions,&quot; said Musil. &quot;The only way protect 

ourselves is to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PSR has been advocating that the United States clean up old and 

dirty power plants, invest in renewable energy sources, improve 

energy efficiency of appliances, and increase the fuel efficiency 

of cars and light trucks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no more time to waste,&quot; said Musil. &quot;The effects 

indicated by the new NAS report and by PSR's research could be as 

devastating as terrorist attacks. The Administration needs to act 

accordingly.&quot; </font></p>
