- March 1 -  The following is a

statement by Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president, National Women's

Law Center:

<p>President Bush's proposed tax cut is unfair to women and their

families. The size of the Bush plan poses a serious threat to

important programs and services that are especially critical to

women and their families, such as Social Security and Medicare.

And the distribution of the plan is unfairly tilted in favor of the

highest-income taxpayers, leaving out vast numbers of women and

children.

<p>The Bush plan provides nothing to the lowest-income families,

many of which are headed by women. Over 30 percent of white single

mothers with children and half of black and Hispanic single mothers

with children would receive nothing from this proposal. Even when

these families don't pay income taxes, they have a substantial

payroll tax burden -- a reality that could be addressed by income

tax reform but is completely ignored by this plan. And women in

general pay a greater share of their income in payroll taxes than

do men.

<p>But women and their families are not simply left out of the

benefits -- they could be seriously harmed by this plan. The

President's plan uses up far too much of the revenue needed for

programs in areas that are critical to women and their families,

such as Social Security, Medicare, education, child care and health

care. So unless there are budget surpluses even higher than the

Administration's projections, cuts in these programs are sure to

follow. While every American benefits from investments in these

federal programs, women have a greater stake in them because they

tend to earn less during their lifetimes, live longer, and are more

likely to have uncompensated family care-taking responsibilities.

Nearly two out of three women 65 and older rely on Social Security

for at least half of their income. And even with Social Security,

one out of five elderly women living alone is poor.

<p>To meet this threat, the National Women's Law Center is

re-activating the Coalition on Women and Taxes to work as an

integral part of Fair Taxes for All. This is a coming together,

once again, of a broad spectrum of groups that were active in the

1986 tax reform debate and successful then in increasing tax

fairness for women, especially single heads of household. We've

banded together to fight for tax fairness for women before and

we're ready to fight again. We know that women are

disproportionately and negatively affected by President Bush's

plan, and we'll be bringing this message to the Administration, to

Congress, and to the public. We'll be mobilizing women across the

country against the Bush tax cut. Because women know what's at

stake. Because women know what's unfair. Because women know what

it means to be left out.

<p><i>Nancy Duff Campbell is the co-president of the National Women's

Law Center and the Chair of the Coalition on Women and Taxes. She

has over 30 years' experience in tax law and policy, especially as

it pertains to women and their families.</i>
