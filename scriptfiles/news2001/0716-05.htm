- July 16 -  The practice of extending marketing monopolies for prescription

drugs if their manufacturers agree to test the drugs for use in children is seriously

flawed, according to an <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/drugs/pedexclusivity.html" target="new">analysis</a> released

today by Public Citizen. Instead, Congress should require companies to test all new drugs

for use in children as a condition of their original approval for marketing by the federal

government.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under so-called &quot;pediatric exclusivity,&quot; drug companies are granted an

additional six months of monopoly protection if they voluntarily test their drugs in

children. This was Congress&#146; solution to the drug industry&#146;s refusal to test its

products for use in children and was intended to encourage more tests to assure the safety

and effectiveness of drugs prescribed for children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But this exclusivity gives a windfall to the prescription drug industry. The U.S. Food

and Drug Administration (FDA) has estimated that pediatric exclusivity will increase

brand-name drug company sales by $29 billion and cost consumers an additional $14 billion

over the next 20 years. Further, the profits enjoyed by the drug companies from the patent

extensions greatly exceed the cost of conducting the studies, which are estimated at

between $1 million and $7.5 million.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The law permitting pediatric exclusivity expires on Jan. 1, 2002, and Congress is

currently debating a bill that would extend it. However, that bill (S. 838), which is

scheduled to be marked up in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee as

early as July 25, would continue to leave many key drugs untested, increase the cost of

drugs for consumers &#151; particularly the elderly &#151; and give a huge windfall to

drug companies, Public Citizen has determined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is Senate Democrats&#146; first test on the issue of prescription drug

costs, and it appears as though they are poised for failure,&quot; said Frank Clemente,

director of Public Citizen&#146;s Congress Watch. &quot;If senators want to assure that

drugs are tested before they are given to children, they should support legislation that

requires this testing to be done as a condition of FDA&#146;s approval of drugs. This

would be the courageous approach, but it requires the Senate to stand up to the drug

industry. It is also the only solution that puts the burden for the safety of drugs where

it should be, squarely on the shoulders of the drug industry, the most profitable industry

in the nation, rather than on the backs of consumers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the key problems of the policy of pediatric exclusivity:</font></p>

<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It fails to ensure that drugs likely to be used in children will be tested in children

  before they are prescribed for their use. The FDA has said that the current law will leave

  more than 100 drugs important for children untested.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

  

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It doesn&#146;t guarantee that companies will make the results of their studies known

  through the labeling changes necessary for drugs to be used safely and effectively in

  children.</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">S. 838, sponsored by Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Mike DeWine (R-Ohio),

reauthorizes pediatric exclusivity with minor changes, so it preserves most of the

program&#146;s flaws. The bill fails to assure that drugs likely to be prescribed for

children will be tested for safety, and it does nothing to address the industry&#146;s

enormous profits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A better alternative would be to end pediatric exclusivity for new drugs and require

drug companies to test new drugs for use in children as a condition of the drugs&#146;

approval by the FDA. For drugs already on the market, Congress should give the FDA

authority to require testing and end the six months of additional patent protection,

Clemente said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s bad enough giving drug companies a huge windfall for something that

should be required as part of the FDA drug approval process,&quot; Clemente said.

&quot;What&#146;s worse is that after consumers pay out an extra $14 billion for pediatric

exclusivity, many of the drugs most needed by children will remain untested.</font></p>

<font FACE="Times New">

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Some advocates for children support the pediatric exclusivity incentive out of

frustration and desperation, fearing that drug companies would conduct no pediatric tests

without a hefty financial reward. This attitude makes it easy for members of Congress to

support S. 838. Senators may see a vote for the Dodd-DeWine bill, which would continue the

handout to the industry, as a safe vote for children. But Senate Democrats need to use

their newfound clout to stop corporate welfare for the drug industry.&quot;</font></p>
