- February 28 - The U.S. Public Interest Research Group applauded Representatives 

          Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) and Senator Joe Lieberman 

          (D-Conn.) for introducing the 2001 Arctic Wilderness Act to protect 

          the fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas drilling 

          by designating the coastal plain as wilderness.

<p align="left">"Now is the time to save the Arctic Refuge from President 

          Bush, Senator Murkowski, and their allies in the oil industry," said 

          Athan Manuel, director of PIRG's Arctic Wilderness campaign. "BP Amoco 

          and ExxonMobil want to ruin one of America's last wild places for six 

          months worth of oil. We thank Reps. Markey and Johnson and Sen. Lieberman 

          for recognizing that it doesn't make sense to ruin America's Arctic.&quot; 

        </p>

        <p align="left">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge protects some of America's 

          most spectacular wilderness and wildlife, including polar bears, caribou, 

          grizzlies, musk oxen and millions of migratory birds. The coastal plain 

          is the calving ground for the 130,000-member Porcupine caribou herd 

          and is sacred to Gwich'in people, a subsistence culture. </p>

        <p align="left">On Monday, Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced 

          an energy package that included a provision that would mandate oil drilling 

          in the Arctic Refuge. The package was the latest attempt by Senator 

          Murkowski, Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to 

          change a two-decade-old law that protects an area scientists call "America's 

          Serengeti." </p>

        <p align="left">U.S. PIRG also called on BP Amoco to accept an Arctic 

          Refuge shareholder resolution filed with the London-based oil giant. 

          BP Amoco is trying to have the resolution disqualified on the grounds 

          that there are too many American investors signed on as co-filers. </p>

        <p align="left">Last year a similar resolution sponsored by U.S. PIRG, 

          Greenpeace, and Trillium Asset Management calling on BP Amoco to switch 

          investment from oil exploration to renewable energy and stay out of 

          the Arctic Refuge was supported by an unprecedented 13 percent of BP 

          Amoco shareholders. </p>

        <p align="left">"It appears that BP's Sir John Browne I is trying to emulate 

          King George III," said Athan Manuel, director of U.S. PIRG's Arctic 

          Wilderness campaign. "BP Amoco would rather censor American investors 

          than discuss important environmental and human rights issues."
