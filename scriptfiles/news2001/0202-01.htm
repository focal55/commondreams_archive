- February 2 - A deadly cargo of plutonium/MOX fuel bound for Japan from Europe will be off the South African coastline within days, threatening the environment, lives and livelihoods of millions of people the international environmental group Greenpeace warned today.

<p>The latest shipment of weapons-usable plutonium fuel left the 

French port of Cherbourg on January 19th 2001 bound for 

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa in Niigata Prefecture, western Japan. The 

so-called plutonium fuel is onboard the British flagged freighter 

the Pacific Pintail which is being escorted on its 30,000 km 

journey by its sister ship the Pacific Teal. Operated by Pacific 

Nuclear Transport Ltd (PNTL) both ships are armed with three 

30mm naval cannon and carry a contingent of armed civilian 

police from the UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary.

<p>A number of countries, such as Argentina and New Zealand, are 

now investigating ways in which they can legally ban nuclear 

shipments from entering their 200 mile Exclusive Economic 

Zones (EEZ). Greenpeace is calling on the South African 

government to follow suit. "Only through collective and vigorous 

opposition to these potentially devastating transports can the 

threatened en-route nations hope to prevent their coastlines from 

becoming major nuclear transport routes," said Mike Townsley 

of Greenpeace International.

<p>"Without concerted opposition from the South African 

Government the nuclear industry plans to make up to 80 nuclear 

shipments from Europe to Japan over the coming decade, 

turning the Cape of Good Hope into a nuclear highway," said 

Townsley.

<p>This is the second such plutonium fuel transport to threaten the 

South African coast. The previous shipment sailed into a storm 

of controversy in 1999 when it was revealed that the state 

owned plutonium company British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) had 

faked vital safety documents for the fuel it was supplying to 

Japan. Having initially denied that the safety documents were 

false,  BNFL has now agreed to take back the plutonium/MOX, 

but no timetable or route have yet been decided.

<p>"If BNFL is prepared to lie to its own customers and the public 

about its fuel safety data then it casts huge doubts over their 

bland assurances about the safety of its nuclear fuel shipments. 

Frankly you wouldn't even buy a second hand car from these 

people," said Mike Townsley of Greenpeace International.

<p>BNFL is the major stakeholder in PNTL and is responsible for 

the current shipment past South Africa. Along with its state-owned French counter part, Cogema, and the French, Japanese 

and British Governments, BNFL has steadfastly refused to 

conduct an international Environmental Impact Assessment of 

its nuclear shipments. En-route states are being denied any right 

of prior consultation, while requests that the ships stay out of 

200 mile national Economic Exclusion Zones are met with 

diplomatic sophistry.

NOTES TO EDITORS:

<p>A special briefing on why South Africa must take a stronger 

stance against nuclear transports is available from the 

Greenpeace Press desk or on the web: 

<a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/%7Enuclear/transport/mox00/sabrief.pdf">http://www.greenpeace.org/~nuclear/transport/mox00/sabrief.pdf</a>

<p>The Belgian nuclear company, Belgonucleaire, manufactured the 

MOX fuel for the Tokyo Electric Power Company. In total 

there is approximately 230kg of plutonium held within the 28 

MOX fuel assemblies, combined with uranium oxide. The 

plutonium was produced from the reprocessing of Japanese 

spent reactor spent fuel at the Cogema UP3 plant on the la 

Hague peninsula.

<p>A group of seven yachts sailed by individuals from Australia and 

New Zealand will be protesting the passage of the nuclear 

shipment by the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal when they sail 

through a narrow stretch of international water only 80 miles 

wide, between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands off the eastern 

coast of Australia. Their website is
