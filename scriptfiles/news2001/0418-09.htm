- April 18 - Women and men from across the country are gearing up to rally in Washington, D.C. in support of abortion rights at the Emergency Action for Women's Lives this Sunday, April 22. After rallying in Upper Senate Park, activists will march past the Senate office buildings, the Supreme Court and the Capitol to a Reproductive Health Fair on the National Mall. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speakers representing all aspects of the movement for reproductive freedom will inspire and energize activists. Joining NOW President Patricia Ireland on the stage will be Eleanor Smeal of the Feminist Majority, Gloria Feldt of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, National Black Women's Health Project Founder Byllye Avery, U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler (D- NY), and speakers from other top groups working for women's rights and civil liberties. Also speaking will be Dr. James Pendergraft, an abortion provider convicted of extortion as a result of his suit seeking protection at his clinic in Ocala, Florida, seemingly as an attempt to shut down his practice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Musical guests at the action include BETTY, disappear fear (reuniting SONiA with her sister Cindy) and Mary Prankster, along with other bands and performers who will rock the afternoon away and inspire the crowd. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Emergency Action for Women's Lives will kick off a four-year campaign by NOW and more than 150 organizational and congressional sponsors. The action will cap two weeks of state lobbying events during the Senate's spring recess and will include a virtual action to inundate senators with e-mail messages upon their return to Washington. </font></p>
