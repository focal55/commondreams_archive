- Januray 22 - By reinstating the Mexico City Policy, he has revived an era when health care providers are forced to conceal the information and advice women need. 

<p>

Today's announcement bans health care providers in other countries from discussing abortion with their patients, even if it's the best option for her health.  And, in a time when 75,000 women around the world die each year from unsafe abortions, Bush has blocked organizations who receive funding from the U.S. from lobbying their own governments to expand reproductive health services.   

<p>

This policy is not only undemocratic, it is inhumane.  It will have a chilling effect on family planning services that save lives on a daily basis by counseling women on safe sex, child spacing, and contraception.  International organizations that provide these and other health care services are now between a rock and a hard place - do they provide inadequate care to their patients, or lose funding for badly needed family planning services?  

<p>

On his third day in office, President Bush has again violated his pledge of unity with this highly divisive and harmful proclamation. By reinstating the Mexico City Policy, he has returned millions of women across the world to the dark ages of ignorance and shoddy medical care.
