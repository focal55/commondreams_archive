- January 8  - "The National Organization for Women

(NOW) insists that inquiries into household workers not be limited to the

women Cabinet nominees this time around," said NOW President Patricia

Ireland.&nbsp; "If this were Lyndon rather than Linda Chavez, would

the same questions have even been raised?"

<p>"The charge of employing an undocumented worker is an all-too-familiar

line of attack against women nominees," Ireland said.&nbsp; "But before

Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood were knocked out of the running by nanny-gate,

male nominees to Clinton's Cabinet were confirmed who also had undocumented

household help or had not paid Social Security taxes for household workers."

<p>"NOW opposes Chavez's confirmation, but we don't need to look into her

kitchen to find dirt; her extremist positions on issues like sexual harassment,

equal pay, affirmative action and minimum wage should keep her from serving

as Secretary of Labor."

<p>"NOW challenges the media and Senate to handle the Cabinet confirmation

hearings even-handedly and ask whether the men nominated by President-elect

Bush may be hiding the same infractions," Ireland said.&nbsp; "A woman

nominee's character, background and qualifications should not be judged

any differently than those of a man."

<p>"NOW will protest at the Presidential Inauguration

on January 20, reminding Bush, Cheney and all Cabinet nominees that we

won't tolerate a roll-back of our rights."
