- April 17 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State has asked members of the Republican congressional leadership to remove controversial religious leaders who have used bigoted language from a panel assembled to craft &quot;faith-based&quot; legislation.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. House Republican Conference, chaired by Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), announced earlier this month that 32 religious leaders have been appointed to serve on an advisory committee for the House-Senate Republican Faith-Based Leadership Summit planned for April 25.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans United research shows that several of the committee's members have made insulting and intolerant comments about religious, ethnic and other minority groups.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is absolutely shocking to see some of the people who have been chosen to help create federal policy on church-state partnerships,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, who wrote to members of Congress about the matter today. &quot;Some of these selections reflect remarkably poor judgment on the part of the House GOP Conference.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While many of the committee members are respected religious leaders, too many are terribly divisive,&quot; Lynn added. &quot;Giving them a role in this initiative is deplorable. I hope these are not the kinds of religious leaders the Bush administration plans to give public funds to.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the most controversial of the committee's members:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bishop J. Delano Ellis</b> -- Ellis was fired from serving as Cleveland's police chaplain in March 1995 after delivering a sermon in which he said Jews were &quot;carnal, selfish...dirty and lowdown and wicked,&quot; according to a report in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. His sermon, which was broadcast over the radio, also said Jews had mistreated others through the years and &quot;God allowed Hitler to rise up and make you all suffer.&quot; Although he added &quot;Hitler was wrong,&quot; Ellis went on to criticize Jews and Muslims for not recognizing Jesus Christ as the son of God.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ellis, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of Christ in Cleveland, also criticized African Americans who convert to Islam, concluding that Islam is &quot;as bad as Israel&quot; and &quot;a chance which you just don't want to take.&quot; Ellis had similar difficulties with Islam later that year when, in a letter to his congregation, he called Islam &quot;false&quot; and said that at its worst, the religion was &quot;bloody and dangerous.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon</b> -- Sheldon, as head of the Traditional Values Coalition, frequently offers extreme anti-gay rhetoric. In recent years, he has written monthly fundraising letters on imagined threats from gay people. In August 1997, for example, Sheldon notified his supporters of a &quot;homosexual conspiracy.&quot; His January 2001 fundraising letter predicted a &quot;homosexual invasion,&quot; which could result in the &quot;stealing of our children.&quot; In 1985, Sheldon even supported quarantining persons with AIDS in so-called &quot;cities of refuge.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sheldon's inclusion on a panel to help implement Bush's faith-based initiative is particularly ironic in light of Sheldon's call for the resignation of John DiIulio, head of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Rev. Reggie White</b> -- White offended virtually every ethnic group in America during a speech to the Wisconsin State Legislature in 1998. White sparked outrage by calling attention to crass stereotypes, saying that blacks &quot;like to sing and dance,&quot; while whites &quot;know how to tap into money.&quot; He went on to say that Hispanic people are &quot;gifted&quot; because they &quot;can put 20 or 30 people in one home,&quot; while Asians know how to &quot;turn a television into a watch.&quot; American Indians, he added, were spared slavery in the U.S. because they &quot;knew how to sneak up on people.&quot; White also said the nation has strayed from God by allowing homosexuality to &quot;run rampant.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a press release from the GOP Conferences, these religious leaders will join others in playing &quot;a critical role&quot; in helping Congress develop faith-based legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;An influential honor, such as working with Congress to develop legislation, should not be bestowed on those who use language that divides and denigrates Americans,&quot; Lynn said in his letter. &quot;It was wrong for these men to make bigoted remarks; their offense is only exacerbated when the United States Congress rewards their intolerance.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn also noted the disregard for diversity within the panel. Of the 32 committee members, only two are women, only one represents a Jewish congregation and there are no representatives from other minority faith traditions, including a total absence of Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The only appropriate solution to this controversy is to promptly remove the three aforementioned individuals from the summit's advisory board,&quot; concluded Lynn's correspondence. &quot;As George Washington said in 1790, 'To Bigotry, No Sanction.' It would serve us all well to use those wise words as a guide today.&quot;</font></p>
