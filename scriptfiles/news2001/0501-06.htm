- May 1 - President Bush is expected to lay out his policy priorities for 

national security in a speech today. Carefully timed leaks by the 

administration indicate that the President will propose cuts in the 

strategic nuclear arsenal, development and deployment of a 

multi-layered 'son of Star Wars' missile defense, and the creation 

of a so-called flexible nuclear force. These plans seem innocuous 

enough at first glance, but contain great danger for U.S. and 

global security. The President's package ignores the real security 

needs of the American people. The global elimination of nuclear 

weapons is the only way to be safe from the possibility of nuclear 

attack. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;President Bush should be leading the way to eliminating the 

nuclear threat, not wasting trillions of dollars on the mirage of 

missile defense and a new nuclear arms race,&quot; said Martin Butcher, 

director of Security Programs for Physicians for Social 

Responsibility (PSR). &quot;Proposed deep cuts in nuclear weapons are 

welcome, but not nearly sufficient for the current strategic 

situation. The cuts that Bush proposes achieve little beyond 

cutting away Cold War dead wood.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Development and construction of a multi-layered national missile 

defense (NMD) would be a multi-trillion dollar fraud on the 

American public and result in a net decrease in security. It will 

likely spur Russia to abandon proposed and agreed nuclear cuts; 

push China to build up its strategic arsenal, with the side effect 

of boosting the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan. It 

will prevent any meaningful arms control or confidence-building 

measures being negotiated or implemented for years to come; and 

will do nothing to protect the American people, since there can 

never be a guarantee that no warheads will ever penetrate the 

so-called 'missile shield'. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Development of a so-called 'flexible' arsenal is code for the 

production of war-fighting 'mini-nukes' designed for use in 

regional conflicts -- especially to counter chemical and biological 

weapons. This dangerous policy would bring nuclear conflict for the 

first time since 1945, making the United States the world's worst 

rogue state. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The package proposed by President Bush will reshape the nuclear 

arsenal from one intended primarily for deterrence to a force 

intended primarily for war-fighting,&quot; said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., 

executive director and CEO of PSR. &quot;The sword of the mini-nuke and 

the shield of missile defense will be a dangerously destabilizing 

factor for global security.&quot; </font></p>
