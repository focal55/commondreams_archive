- July 2 - A state district judge in Minnesota today ruled that a recent decision striking down the state's sodomy law applies to every adult. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision means that Minnesota is the third state this year to move away from antiquated laws that have been used against the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) community. In April, an Arkansas circuit court judge found that the state's ban on consensual sex between adult, same-sex couples is a violation of the state&#146;s constitution. And in May, Arizona Gov. Jane Hall signed a bill repealing that state's sodomy laws. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monday's ruling in Minnesota came in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. In May of this year, State District Court Judge Delila F. Pierce initially ruled that the sodomy law is unconstitutional. After that ruling, the ACLU asked the judge to certify her ruling as a class action so that there would be no question that it would apply to every adult. Today, the judge granted the ACLU's request. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For centuries, sodomy laws have been used as a weapon against the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community, sometimes with very tragic results,&quot; said NGLTF Executive Director Lorri L. Jean. &quot;We commend those who have bravely fought to overturn this law, both at the legislative level and in the courts. Minnesota was the first state in the U.S. to pass a sexual orientation civil rights law that included gender identity. Now it is the latest state to reject an antiquated law that compromises our right to privacy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Four states -- Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri -- have sodomy laws that single out same-sex relationships, although Missouri's law has been struck down by a lower court. Eleven other states have sodomy laws that outlaw some forms of both heterosexual and homosexual activity. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity where all people may fully participate in society. </i></font></p>
