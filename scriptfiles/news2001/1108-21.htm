- November 8 - US bombs have destroyed a hydroelectric plant next to Afghanistan's 

largest dam, according to UN sources. The London newspaper, The 

Independent, reports that the dam itself does not appear to have been 

hit but that the loss of power has incapacitated gates regulating 

water discharges from the reservoir.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If long-awaited rains arrive and the dam's electric-powered gates 

cannot be opened there is a risk that the reservoir could overflow. 

This could in turn cause the dam to burst resulting in what UN 

officials describe as a &quot;disaster of tremendous proportions&quot;. UN 

officials also fear that further air raids risk destroying the dam.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the dam collapses the whole Helmand valley would be flooded, 

risking the life of tens of thousands of people,&quot; states an internal 

report prepared by the UN's regional coordinator for Southern 

Afghanistan and made available to The Independent. &quot;It is crucial to 

have the situation at the Kajaki dam/power plant assessed,&quot; says the 

UN report.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International Rivers Network is alarmed to learn of the situation at 

the Kajaki dam. &quot;There is an urgent need for the US government to 

work with the international community to ensure that the safety of 

Kajaki dam is secured and the power supply to its gates restored,&quot; 

says Patrick McCully, Campaigns Coordinator for International Rivers 

Network. Emergency evacuation plans also need to be made for 

downstream communities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The deliberate or accidental destruction of a dam, like that of a 

nuclear power plant, can have catastrophic consequences. Targeting 

dams and nuclear plants is prohibited under a 1977 Protocol to the 

Geneva Convention &quot;if such attack may cause the release of dangerous 

forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Independent quotes Pakistan sources as saying that a contingent 

of Arab troops of Osama bin Laden's al-Qa'ida group had been based at 

a military post close to the Kajaki dam. It is not clear if they were 

present when the bombing took place, whether the damage to the 

hydroelectric plant was inflicted deliberately, or whether it was due 

to inaccurate targeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Independent reports that the 48-year-old dam on the Helmand River 

is 300ft high, 900ft long, and holds back 1.85 million cubic meters 

of water in a 32-mile long reservoir. The dam, built by US engineers 

and equipped with US-built turbines, is reported to have a generating 

capacity of 33 megawatts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kajaki dam, designed by US engineers and equipped with US-built 

turbines, provides irrigation water to lands supplying food for 

around a million people, according to the UN. If this water supply is 

disrupted due to the cutting of the power supply to the dam's sluice 

gates there will be further severe damage to the harvest in a region 

already threatened by food shortages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Independent explains that too little water from the dam now would 

make it impossible to plant winter wheat. Too much water released now 

would deplete the reservoir, causing the wheat crop to shrivel in the 

spring. &quot;In addition, in the case of the long-awaited rain arriving, 

the dam risks bursting without a proper functioning 

control/regulatory mechanism in place,&quot; says the UN report. &quot;Needless 

to say, the regulatory mechanism is powered by electricity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dam provided electricity to around 500,000 people and to several 

hospitals and industries. The powerlines to the city of Kandahar, 60 

miles south-east, were rehabilitated by the Taliban earlier this year 

after being destroyed during the nation's civil war. Chinese 

contractors were adding a further 16.5 MW of generating capacity to 

the dam when the US bombing campaign began.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kajaki dam has been at the center of a long-running diplomatic 

dispute between Afghanistan and Iran which lies downstream of the 

dam. Iran claims that the diversion of water for irrigation at Kajaki 

deprives a fertile Iranian farming region of water. Iranians living 

along the Helmand may also be at risk in the event of Kajaki dam 

collapsing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmentalists say that the dam has contributed to the desiccation 

of a lake and wetlands ecosystem on the Iranian-Afghani border which 

provides waterfowl habitat of international significance.</font></p>
