<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO 

- December 17 - In a meeting with 

non-governmental human rights and environmental organizations in 

San Francisco last week, U.N. Special Rapporteur Fatma Zora 

Ouhachi-Vesely had harsh words for the United States' practice 

of exporting chemicals, pesticides, and waste banned 

domestically to developing nations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Just because something is not illegal, it may still be 

immoral. Allowing the export of products recognized to be 

harmful is immoral,&quot; said Vesely as she gathered information 

about U.S. toxic export practices. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Special Rapporteur to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights 

(Geneva), Vesely was in the United States on a fact-finding 

mission during which she met with government officials and 

non-governmental organizations. The mandate of the Special 

Rapporteur on Toxics addresses traffic in toxic and dangerous 

products and wastes and its impact on human rights. Vesely was 

in the United States to examine current issues and trends in the 

international transfer of materials and to learn about threats 

to human rights in the United States and abroad. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The International Journal of Occupational and Environmental 

Health noted that between 1996 and 2000, the United States 

exported nearly 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides that have been 

identified as known or suspected carcinogens, an average rate of 

almost 16 tons per hour. Most of these exports are sent to the 

developing world and used in agriculture. According to the 

International Labor Organization, 65 to 90 percent of the 

children estimated to be working in Africa (80 million), Asia 

(152 million) and Latin America (17 million) are working in 

agriculture. These children are often continuously exposed to 

pesticides in the fields, from their water, through their 

clothing, and at their homes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vesely explained why the export of pesticides banned in the 

United States creates human rights issues. &quot;Even if something is 

marked 'poison' it tends to be shipped in large amounts, then 

transferred to smaller containers without proper labeling for 

local sale and use. And the people actually using the products 

often cannot read anyway,&quot; she explained. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During her visit to the United States Vesely also met with 

government officials. &quot;US officials told me that pesticides 

banned in the United States but exported cannot be regulated if 

there is a demand overseas, because of free-trade agreements.&quot; 

But NGOs presented proof that the demand from developing 

countries stems from promotional campaigns by the U.S. companies 

that profit from these sales. &quot;Developing countries do not have 

the medical or regulatory capacity to address the negative 

effects of these chemicals on their population. That is what 

makes this is an immoral practice,&quot; explained Vesely. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vesely also explained that in an interconnected world 

economy, pesticides banned in the United States can find their 

way back into the United States via food imports. Vesely 

explained, &quot;So banning the export of dangerous pesticides can 

protect Americans as well.&quot; </font></p>
