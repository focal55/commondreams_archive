- May 23 - In a May 17 letter to the National Rifle Association, Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that his Justice Department believes 

that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees an 

individual right to own firearms -- a view that runs contrary to 

federal court decisions spanning nearly 120 years and reverses the stance of the previous administration. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The change in position is troubling not only because it ignores 

legal precedent, but because it could undermine the promise 

Ashcroft made to the American people during his confirmation 

hearings to fully enforce the nation's gun laws. How can our 

Attorney General enforce laws that he and his Justice Department 

believe violate the Constitution of the United States? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The meaning and intent of the Second Amendment is clear: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The U.S. Supreme Court case U.S. v. Miller (1939) ruled that 

the Second Amendment protects a state's right to maintain a 

well-regulated militia rather than an individual's right to possess 

a firearm. The Supreme Court has declined to hear another Second 

Amendment case since that ruling. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The courts have let stand gun control laws including the 

Brady Law, and even handgun bans in several U.S. cities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger vigorously 

argued that the Second Amendment referred to a collective state 

right, and characterized attempts by those who would distort the 

meaning of the Second Amendment as &quot;fraud.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Ashcroft's personal interpretation of the Second Amendment 

is not surprising (he espoused the same view as Governor, and later 

Senator from the state of Missouri), his view now takes on added 

significance in his role as Attorney General. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coalition to Stop Gun Violence President Michael K. Beard took 

issue with Ashcroft's irresponsible misinterpretation of the Second 

Amendment, and called on the Justice Department to renew its 

commitment to enforcing established law: &quot;Attorney General Ashcroft swore to uphold and enforce the law during his 

confirmation hearings. For the Justice Department to take a 

position so contrary to the established meaning of the Second 

Amendment sheds a wary light on where Mr. Ashcroft's true 

commitments lie. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The intent and meaning of the Second Amendment is clear. In 

ruling after ruling, the federal courts, including the Supreme 

Court, have ruled that the Second Amendment refers to the 

collective right of states to maintain militias, and not an 

individual right to own a firearm.&quot; </font></p>
