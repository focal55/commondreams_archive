campuses across the country at noon today.  The events

emphasized the need for a cautious, reasoned and

long-term solution to the terrorist attacks that will

result in safety for all people.  Anna Brogan of

Eastern Michigan University cautions, &quot;There has never

been an effective military solution to terrorism.  We

question the wisdom of America seeking a military

solution now.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The students and community members have concerns

stemming from threats and hate based on race,

ethnicity, and religion that have occurred since last

Tuesday?s attacks as well as over the potential loss

of civil liberties.  The actions affirmed the sanctity

of life by seeking peace and justice in the wake of

Tuesday's tragedy.  Students and campus groups are

reclaiming their historical role as advocates for

peace to initiate discussion nationally on protecting

human life around the world, especially the safety of

Arabs and Muslim communities domestically and

internationally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activities offered sympathy and a strong sense of

solidarity with the victims and families affected by

the tragedy in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The events were spread across a diverse geographic

range of campuses.  Small schools as well as

historically active and large campuses participated.

Over eight thousand students and community members

took part in the demonstration on the Berkeley campus

that included a march from Sproul Plaza.  Last night a

sit in was organized protesting a racist cartoon

against Arab and Muslim-Americans in a local paper. 

Nineteen people were arrested.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the University of Kansas, students raised $25,000

in 48 hours for relief for the families and victims of

the September 11th tragedy before holding two rallies,

one on campus and one in the town square with

community members in Lawrence.   The University of

Arkansas in Fayetteville had a teach-in for 600 people

to learn more about Afghanistan.  The students at the

University of Wisconsin at Madison submitted a

petition against a protracted military campaign to

Congressional Representative Tammy Baldwin.  &quot;This was

something that campuses across the whole nation could

relate to,&quot; said Liz Bruna, a student from Madison. 

At Wesleyan College in Connecticut, where the idea for

the national day originated, 500 students participated

in what Mary Thomas called &quot;a transition from mourning

to action.&quot;  After a vigil, students at Wesleyan also

hand delivered a petition to their representative, Rob

Simmons.</font></p>
