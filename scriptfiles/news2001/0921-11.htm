<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - September 21 - The lives of thousands of Afghan 

civilians are being placed at risk by border control and immigration 

policies that have tightened since the September 11 attacks in the 

United States, Human Rights Watch said today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have fled towards the Pakistani 

border in recent days, while others are moving toward Tajikistan and 

Iran. All six countries bordering Afghanistan - Pakistan, Iran, 

Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and China - have officially closed 

their borders to Afghanistan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pakistan's actions were in direct response to a request from the U.S. to 

strengthen security in an effort to apprehend those responsible for the 

attacks. Western governments, including the U.S., Australia, and         

                                     European Union member states, are 

also tightening immigration controls in a way that could further deny 

protection to Afghan refugees. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite border restrictions, some 15,000 Afghan refugees have entered 

Pakistan in the past week, most of them arriving in Balochistan province 

on the southwest border. A further 5,000 Afghan refugees who were massed 

for several days at the Chaman border crossing near Quetta finally 

entered the country and are now encamped on the Pakistan side of the 

border. The Iranian government, while reiterating that it is unable to 

admit any new refugees, has offered to assist Afghans through 

cross-border assistance operations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Afghanistan's neighbors face real security concerns at this time,&quot; said 

Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. &quot;But 

these countries have international obligations to meet their security 

concerns by screening out armed elements so that borders remain open for 

refugees.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Human Rights Watch also opposes the establishment of camps inside 

Afghanistan, or the creation of so-called &quot;safe havens.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Past experience from Bosnia, Rwanda, and Northern Iraq tells us that 

'safe havens' have proved to be anything but safe,&quot; said Reilly. 

&quot;Instead, any refugee camps established should be outside the territory 

of Afghanistan.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Afghan civilians now face three serious problems, Human Rights Watch 

said. First, the border closures by Afghanistan's neighbors mean that 

people fleeing Afghanistan have nowhere to go for protection. Second, 

the withdrawal of international relief agencies will jeopardize food 

supplies in a country already facing famine. And third, Afghans with a 

valid fear of persecution seeking asylum overseas, particularly in 

Western countries, may face prolonged immigration detention or 

deportation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to safeguard the lives of Afghan civilians and refugees, Human 

Rights Watch makes the following urgent recommendations: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -All neighboring countries and countries in the region should     

reopen their borders to refugees from Afghanistan; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -As a matter of urgency, host and donor governments, and United     

Nations agencies should develop a coordinated strategy to     

effectively identify and separate militants and armed elements     from 

civilian refugees. Separation should take place inside host     

countries at the border and involve an international monitoring     

presence; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -Camps, safe havens, or humanitarian zones within Afghanistan     

should not be established. Instead, all refugees should be     permitted 

into neighboring states; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -Governments outside the region, particularly industrialized     

states, should explore emergency resettlement possibilities for     

Afghan refugees; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -Tougher immigration controls in countries outside the region,     

particularly industrialized states, should not infringe on the     

rights of all asylum seekers to access fair and efficient asylum     

determination procedures, nor should they result in arbitrary or     

indefinite detention, or the return of asylum seekers and refugees     

to countries where they face persecution; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -Donor governments should urgently provide international assistance   

  to neighboring countries and countries in the region to cope with     

the potential outflow of refugees from Afghanistan; and </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   -Donor governments and international relief agencies should take     

all steps possible to ensure that adequate humanitarian assistance     

reaches all affected civilians inside Afghanistan, especially the     

internally displaced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conditions inside Afghanistan are deplorable. Twenty years of civil war, 

continuing human rights violations under the Taliban regime, and severe 

drought have already created a fragile situation with many on the verge 

of starvation. As many as one million people are internally displaced 

within the country and thousands more have fled Kabul and Qandahar in 

the past days. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The departure of all international aid staff after last week's attacks 

in the U.S. leaves Afghanistan's civilian population in an even more 

vulnerable condition. The World Food Program has estimated that it only 

has enough food supplies to last two to three weeks - a total of 3.8 

million people are reliant on food aid in the country. Thousands of 

civilians are likely to flee the deteriorating security and humanitarian 

conditions inside Afghanistan over the coming weeks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 3.7 million Afghan refugees who have fled the conflict in 

Afghanistan over the past two decades are currently living in 

neighboring countries - 1.5 million of them in Iran, and more than 2 

million in Pakistan. Frustrated by the large scale and protracted nature 

of the refugee crisis and the lack of international attention to their 

plight, both Iran and Pakistan have officially closed their borders to 

refugees for the past year. An estimated 10,000 Afghan refugees, 

including thousands of women and children, have been camped on several 

islands in the Pyanj River at the Tajikistan border, since the Tajik 

government closed its borders a year ago and stationed 10,000 Russian 

troops at the border to prevent refugees from entering. 

 

The right of refugees not to be returned to a country where their lives 

or freedom are threatened is a fundamental principle of international 

customary law and is enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which 

Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and China are all parties.
