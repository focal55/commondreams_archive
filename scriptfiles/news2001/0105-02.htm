<p>River conservation groups across the country are on full alert

as a little-known federal agency begins public hearings this

Monday, Jan. 8, to consider changing the way the government

regulates private hydropower dams on our nation's rivers. At the

direction of Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and at the behest of

the electric utility industry, the Federal Energy Regulatory

Commission (FERC) will hold a series of public meetings across the

country -- starting Monday in Washington, DC -- "to determine ways

to reduce the cost and time of obtaining a (hydropower dam)

license."

<p>American Rivers, American Whitewater, and Trout Unlimited-three

of America's leading river conservation organizations -- and more

than 70 grassroots groups from across the country today voiced

concern that these hearings are just the latest in a long line of

efforts by powerful utilities and their lobbyists to escape the

obligations that come with the use of public rivers.

<p>Following on the heels of last year's legislative efforts by

Senator Larry Craig (R-ID), the conservation community is

pessimistic about the intent of these hearings, which appears to be

an extension of industry efforts to roll back long-term

environmental protections under the cover of a short-term energy

problem.

<p>"Poorly run dams degrade water quality, hurt wildlife, and limit

recreation and economic growth," said Andrew Fahlund, Policy

Director for Hydropower Programs at American Rivers. "Licensing of

hydropower dams is an opportunity to bring a 19th Century

technology up to 21st Century standards. These projects have

operated for 30 to 100 years with no concern for environmental

damage."

<p>"With only miniscule cuts in their profit making ability,

utility corporations could modernize the way they operate their

dams. Instead, they are spending millions on lobbying and scare

tactics to tell the public and Congress that they can't make

reasonable improvements," added Fahlund.

<p>The Federal Power Act grants authority to the Federal Energy

Regulatory Commission (FERC) and several other federal and state

agencies to regulate the operation of mostly private hydropower

dams on public waterways. Every 30 to 50 years, a dam owner must

apply to FERC for a new operating license. This licensing process

requires consideration of ecological health, water quality, and

recreation so that operation of the dam continues to be in the

public interest. Over the next decade, the licenses for more than

500 dams affecting 130 different rivers will expire. Licensing

presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to modernize these dams

to protect the environment.

<p>"In these hearings, the hydropower industry is going after the

agencies that protect fish and public lands. Generating electricity

need not preclude thriving fish and wildlife that boost local

economies and quality of life," said Steve Malloch, Western Water

Counsel for Trout Unlimited. "But it will if the agencies charged

with protecting public values are shut out. Utility companies need

to do their part by operating their dams in a responsible way, so

our kids can enjoy healthy rivers."

<p>"We're asking utilities to do their fair share to keep our

majestic rivers usable for everyone," said John Gangemi,

Conservation Director for American Whitewater. "They can be a

partner in helping to boost recreation and economic growth in local

communities by giving boaters and fishermen more access to rivers,

protecting habitat for wildlife, and providing open space for

public parks."

<p>Matt Sicchio, Coordinator of the Hydropower Reform

Coalition-representing more than 70 conservation and recreation

groups nationwide-stressed that these hearings are about the future

of our rivers, not about energy and government red-tape.

"Hydropower licenses allow utilities to monopolize a river for a

half a century with little oversight and no motivation to make

further environmental improvements. We must get it right the first

time. No matter what FERC proposes to Congress by way of changes,

it must not mortgage the health of our rivers in the process."
