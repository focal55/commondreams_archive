- November 14 - The Green Party of the United States has renewed its call for the U.S. to halt

the military assaults on Afghanistan, as the war threatens to spread and Afghans face starvation in the coming months.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Continuing the strikes through Ramadan will further alienate Muslims and jeopardize fragile

alliances with Pakistan and other Muslim nations,&quot; said Tom Sevigny, Connecticut Green activist and member of the national party's steering committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pakistan's President, General Pervez Musharraf, warns that the U.S. assaults are &quot;perceived in

the whole world as a war against the poor, miserable and innocent people of Afghanistan&quot; and that continuing attacks during Ramadan would have &quot;negative fall-out in the entire Muslim world.&quot; 

The war on Afghanistan puts the military junta in Pakistan in an explosive dilemma. Already on shaky ground, the undemocratic Pakistani government faces destabilization, with dire consequences if Pakistan's small nuclear arsenal falls into the wrong hands. Meanwhile, Pakistani extremists are increasing acts of violence in Kashmir, forcing a confrontation with India. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Our ill-considered response to the September 11 atrocities endangers the stability of two hostile nuclear powers -- Pakistan and India - with unknowable results,&quot; said Robbie Franklin, a Texas Green activist and treasurer of the national party. &quot;It is a very dangerous situation with consequences far greater than anything we can hope to gain in the war on Afghanistan.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The military strikes have already proved devastating for the people of Afghanistan, especially the use of cluster bombs, fuel air bombs, and carpet bombing by the U.S. as the Taliban dispersed into civilian areas. But the retreat of the Taliban from Kabul provides an opening for the delivery of humanitarian aid and the beginning of restored human rights for Afghans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The only hope for Afghanistan is massive intervention from the U.N.,&quot; said Holly Hart, secretary of the Iowa Green Party and co-chair of the national platform committee. &quot;Such an effort must provide emergency food and medical supplies, attempt to prevent further bloodshed in the civil war between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, and address the brutal treatment of Afghan people -- especially women -- by both the

Taliban and the Northern Alliance. We must guarantee that the fall of repressive, misogynistic laws in Kabul after the Taliban fled is not reversed by the Northern Alliance.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party continues to demand that the criminals behind the September 11 atrocities betried according to international law in an appropriate court. The Rome Statute, which the U.S. refuses to ratify, would provide such a forum. The non-retroactivity clause of the Rome Statute would preclude using the International Criminal Court to try the September 11 criminals. However, Greens note that an ad hoc tribunal based on the principles of the Rome Statute can be convened to indict and try those responsible

for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, House and Senate negotiators last week agreed to block U.S. participation in the U.N.'s establishment of an International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity. The U.S. government refuses to cooperate in international attempts to hold all nations responsible for crimes like the September 11 attacks, and prefers unilateral force, since the U.S. considers itself exempt

from accountability for violation of international law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge the U.S. government to build a worldwide coalition of governments pledging to refrain from acts of violence against civilians and to prevent independent groups from doing the same,&quot; said Jane M. Hunter, vice-chair of the Green Party of New Jersey.</font></p>
