- October 26 -  In the shadow of the most devastating terrorist attack in 

history, the Pentagon today announced its most lucrative

contract ever: a $200 billion deal with Lockheed Martin to build

the Joint Strike Fighter, a next-generation combat jet that

ultimately will replace aircraft used by the Navy, Air Force and

Marine Corps.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awarded on a &quot;winner takes all&quot; basis, the contract calls for

construction of 3,000 JSFs and was considered so momentous that

Lockheed Martin and Boeing--the only two companies who competed

for the contract--spent hundreds of thousands, if not millions,

of dollars on advertising and other lobbying efforts in an

attempt to sway federal officials in their favor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the calendar year 2000, Lockheed Martin spent more than

$9.8 million lobbying members of Congress and the Clinton

administration, more than double the $4.2 million the company

spent during 1999. Among the company's newest lobbyists: Haley

Barbour, the former chairman of the Republican National

Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boeing, meanwhile, reported $7.8 million in lobbying

expenditures during 2000--about $400,000 less than its spending

during the calendar year 1999. In July, Boeing hired Rudy de

Leon, a former deputy secretary of defense under President

Clinton, as its top Washington lobbyist--a move that angered

some key Republicans, including Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.) who

called the hiring &quot;a slap in the face&quot; to the GOP.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of campaign spending, it was a battle of giant vs.

giant. During the 1999-2000 election cycle, Lockheed Martin

contributed just over $2.7 million in soft money, PAC and

individual contributions to federal candidates and parties. More

than two-thirds of that money went to Republicans. On the other

hand, Boeing gave $1.9 million to federal parties and

candidates, split almost equally between Democrats and

Republicans. That doesn't include Lockheed Martin's $225,000 in

checks written to the Bush-Cheney Inaugural Fund or Boeing's

$100,000 contribution to the same committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just months into the 2001-02 election cycle, contributions from

the two companies have been far more even. Through June 30th of

this year, Boeing had contributed just under $468,000 to federal

parties and candidates, 58 percent to Republicans. Lockheed

Martin, meanwhile, had contributed $550,875, more than

two-thirds to the GOP.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With all that money, it's not surprising that the backroom

politics over the deal got testy in recent weeks. Boeing, for

example, accused Lockheed Martin of deliberately playing up its

Texas ties in pressing for the JSF contract, hoping to score

points with the Bush White House. (Lockheed Martin plans to

build the planes at its plant in Fort Worth.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, Boeing elicited support from some of the most

influential leaders on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker

Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt

(D-Mo.) and nearly every member of the Washington state

congressional delegation. Gephardt last month sent a letter to

the Pentagon urging it to award the JSF program to Boeing, which

had planned to build the aircraft in St. Louis. Boeing was the

No. 6 contributor to Gephardt's 2000 re-election campaign,

contributing $13,500.</font></p>
