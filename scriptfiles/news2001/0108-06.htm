- January 8 - As Bruce Babbitt knows, the job of Secretary of the Interior is a lonely

one. The single personage responsible for a third of our nation’s land and

the office concerns itself with everything from mining and ranching to

endangered species. The Interior Department must be the voice for that most

valuable American resource, the land itself. While Babbitt was a noted

environmentalist, George Bush’s pick for this post, Gale Norton, has

demonstrated time and again that she feels more comfortable in the role of

advocate for timber, mining, petroleum and other industries.



<p>Norton has demonstrated her coziness with moneyed business interests

throughout her career in government. She first gained prominence working for

James Watt at the Mountain States Legal Foundation, an advocacy group whose

major donors include a dozen oil companies including Exxon, Amoco, and

Chevron. The Mountain States Legal Foundation has taken legal action against

environmental protection, seeking to preserve protection only for business

and industry, its biggest benefactors.



<p>Continuing her well-documented rise through the anti-environmental ranks,

Norton joined then-Interior Secretary Watt in President Reagan’s Interior

Department. The department was nearly dismantled during Watt’s tenure. Her

creative form of environmental degradation continued through her tenure as

Attorney General of Colorado and on into the birth of the Coalition of

Republican Environmental Activists (CREA).



<p>CREA is as transparent on the environment as Norton herself. A number of

prominent Republicans who actually are environmentalists declined to join

the group at its inception because its members were obviously wolves in

green clothing. Those refusing the extreme views of Norton and CREA included

former Kansas governor John Hayden and Rep. Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY), the

leader of moderate House Republicans on the environment.



<p>But particularly disturbing is Norton’s lack of concern for children and

their health. Norton is registered to lobby Congress and the Colorado State

Legislator on behalf of NL Industries of Houston, Texas. NL Industries was

once known as National Lead Company, a defendant in cases involving scores

of Superfund sites and a dozen cases about children’s exposure to lead

paint. Senators should be mindful not only of Norton’s anti-environmentalism

but especially of her views opposing children’s health. They must reject her

nomination as Secretary of the Interior. The land, water and health of our

children have too few advocates already. The mining, timber and petroleum

industries already have more than we need.





<p><i>Robert K. Musil, Ph.D. is Executive Director and CEO of <a href="http://www.psr.org">Physicians for

Social Responsibility</a> (PSR), a national membership organization in

Washington, DC. It shared the 1985 Nobel Prize for Peace with International

Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War  and supports sensible gun laws

to reduce firearms injuries and deaths.</i>
