- February 5 - In a bid to convince European allies that national missile defense

deployment is inevitable, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told European defense ministers at a weekend conference in Germany that the U.S. will

make a decision to deploy. &quot;The United States intends to develop and deploy

a missile defense designed to defend our people and forces against a

limited missile attack,&quot; said Rumsfeld.<br>

        <br>

&quot;Once again, proponents of missile defense are putting the cart before the

horse,&quot; said John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World.<br>

	<br>

&quot;Rumsfeld is trying give the illusion that deployment is inevitable, when

there is no workable technology ready for deployment,&quot; added Isaacs.<br>

	<br>

&quot;The Clinton missile defense system has been tested only three times, with

only one partial success,&quot; continued Isaacs. &quot;The Bush Administration may

opt for entirely different, and untested technology based on sea or in space.&quot;<br>

	<br>

Even Rumsfeld tacitly acknowledged that the system is likely to be flawed

when he argued that missile defense &quot;need not be perfect.&quot;<br>

	<br>

Most NATO governments question the American missile defense plan.  The

Germans, French and Canadians have been particularly vocal, both before and

during the conference.<br>

	<br>

&quot;Rumsfeld's message to Europeans:&quot; said Isaacs, &quot;Drink your castor oil even

if you despise it.&quot;<br>

	<br>

Rumsfeld resorted to one of the oldest rhetorical tricks of politicians

when he labeled missile defense &quot;a moral issue.&quot;<br>

	<br>

&quot;Beware of politicians and policy makers who argue morality rather than

facts,&quot; argued Isaacs. &quot;It is one of the last refuges of scoundrels.&quot;<br>

	<br>

Rumsfeld was supported in his case by other American officials. Connecticut

Senator Joseph Lieberman told the conference: &quot;The question from an

American point of view is not whether we will have a national missile

defense but when and how.&quot;  Lieberman's statement was extraordinary

considering he also said that missile defense &quot;is not a technologically feasible program&quot; and deployment is &quot;years away.&quot;<br>

	<br>

It was not clear how a system that does not work at present, has not been

budgeted for and  cannot be deployed for at least 7 - 10 years is inevitable.<br>
