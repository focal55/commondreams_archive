- December 17 - People For the American 

Way Foundation today released a report detailing the vicious 

campaign that right-wing groups have employed since Sept. 11 to try 

to force quick confirmation of President Bush's judicial nominees. 

The report, &quot;How Low Will They Go? The Right Wing's Attack Campaign 

To Advance Judicial Nominations,&quot; documents attacks that go far 

beyond the usual partisan rhetoric -- including attacks that 

challenge the patriotism and integrity of Senate Majority Leader 

Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman 

Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. The PFAWF report is available at: 

<a href="http://www.pfaw.org/issues/right/HowLow.pdf" target="_new">http://www.pfaw.org/issues/right/HowLow.pdf</a> </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nominees for lifetime appointments to our federal courts 

deserve close and careful scrutiny,&quot; said PFAWF President Ralph G. 

Neas said. &quot;This attack campaign is designed to undercut that 

scrutiny, which is a critical responsibility that our Constitution 

confers on the Senate. Even worse, these right-wing groups have 

stooped to new levels by trying to use the war on terrorism to 

further their own political agenda for the courts. Senators must 

resist this campaign of intimidation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How Low Will They Go?&quot; reveals how this attack campaign was 

first crafted. Detailing a memo written by a Republican staffer 

and enthusiastically endorsed by at least one person in the White 

House, the report reveals how the Right has used the Sept. 11 

tragedies as a vehicle to press for speedy confirmation of Bush's 

judicial nominations by falsely claiming these nominees are needed 

on the bench to order wiretaps and search warrants necessary for 

fighting terrorism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the wake of the terrorist attacks, right-wing groups and 

their Senate GOP allies have held news conferences and issued 

statements to put Sens. Daschle and Leahy on notice: confirm the 

president's judicial nominees or we'll use the war on terrorism to 

wage war on you. As &quot;How Low Will They Go?&quot; explains, the 

post-Sept. 11 strategies used by the far-right leaders include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Falsely suggesting that federal appeals court vacancies are 

having a negative effect on fighting terrorism -- even though the 

judges who serve on these courts do not have responsibility for 

granting search warrants or approving wiretaps. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Questioning the patriotism and integrity of Senate Democrats, 

including placing ads in the home state of Senate Majority Leader 

Tom Daschle that challenge his commitment to fighting terrorism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Claiming that Senate Democrats are engaging in &quot;racial 

profiling.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Calling for Sen. Leahy's removal as chairman of the Judiciary 

Committee. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Unsuccessfully attempting to link judicial confirmations to 

foreign aid. </font></p>
