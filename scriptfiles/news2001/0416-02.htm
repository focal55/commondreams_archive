- April 16 - In a letter sent today to Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, The Humane Society of the United States urged the USDA to increase measures to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease to the United States. The HSUS, which is the nation's largest animal protection organization, also cautioned the agency that it should not put globalization of agriculture and trade above the protection of animals in dealing with any potential outbreak of the highly contagious disease in the United States. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The staggering scale of industrialized meat production in the U.S. has made domestic livestock vulnerable to a large-scale outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease,&quot; said Patricia Forkan, HSUS executive vice president. &quot;Viruses can spread like wildfire in massive livestock facilities where thousands of animals are crammed together in confined areas. We've turned farms into factories and, if foot-and-mouth hits the U.S., the animals will continue to pay the price.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Another significant factor in the threat of our livestock becoming diseased is the rapid globalization of the livestock industry,&quot; Forkan added. FMD is endemic in South America, Asia, and Africa, and it can be spread by animals, clothing, farm equipment and even the wind. British detectives suspect that the source of the recent outbreak of the disease was an illegal shipment of tainted meat from East Asia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite how easily the disease could enter the U.S., Agricultural Secretary Veneman has said she is seeking to balance the forces of globalization with the need to protect the $50 billion meat industry. Forkan responds: &quot;Animal suffering should not be disregarded in order to serve the interest of the meat industry.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The USDA acknowledges that FMD could rapidly spread throughout the U.S. by routine livestock movements unless it is detected early and eradicated immediately. The HSUS urges the USDA to take the following steps: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Develop a plan to vaccinate farm animals should the disease be identified in the U.S. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Impose a moratorium on all livestock and livestock product imports. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; End risky farming practices that make the U.S. particularly susceptible to the spread of FMD. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&middot; Develop a protocol for humanely killing animals affected by FMD if culling should become necessary to keep animal suffering to a minimum. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Scenes of cattle and sheep in Europe being shot and bulldozed into burning heaps of corpses have shocked viewers around the world. And reports of animal cruelty are surfacing,&quot; concluded Forkan. &quot;We need to take all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of this disease into the U.S. and review agricultural and trade practices that make us vulnerable to a large-scale FMD outbreak as well as food-borne diseases such as Mad Cow Disease.&quot; </font></p>
