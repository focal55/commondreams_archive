- February 5 - The National Council of

Women's Organizations (NCWO), in partnership with seven of its

national member organizations, will convene a Summit on Women and

Social Security on Feb. 8. More than 300 leaders of grassroots

organizations representing all 50 states will participate in the two

days of meetings, training workshops, and Congressional office

visits. The attendees will deliver a unified message to Capitol

Hill: Individual Accounts carved-out of Social Security will hurt

women and families. The conference has been called because national

women's groups are concerned that privatization would necessarily

jeopardize the guarantee of lifetime, inflation-adjusted benefits

that Social Security now provides.

<p>"Most workers will face cuts in guaranteed benefits that are not

made up by income from an individual account," according to Heidi

Hartmann, Ph.D., president of the Institute for Women's Policy

Research and Chair of the NCWO Women and Social Security Project.

"If privatizers keep their promises to current retirees-younger

workers will get less when they retire."

<p>"The majority of the more than 100 organizations in NCWO are

extremely concerned about Social Security privatization," added

Martha Burk, Ph.D., chair of NCWO. "The Women &amp; Social Security

Summit will mark an important milestone in the effort to preserve

the guaranteed benefits of Social Security that millions of

Americans-women in particular-depend on."

<p>The event will be cosponsored by Business and Professional

Women/USA, the American Association of University Women, OWL: the

Voice of Midlife and Older Women, the National Council of Negro

Women, the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement, the National

Organization for Women, and the Feminist Majority. The Summit

Advisory Committee includes the Institute for Women's Policy

Research, the Center for the Advancement of Public Policy, the

National Women's Law Center and the YWCA of the USA. The goal is to

engage citizen activists in the debate and to build support for

addressing gender inequities in the current system.

<p><i>The National Council of Women's Organization's (NCWO) is a

nonpartisan, nonprofit coalition of more than 115 women's

organizations across the nation collectively representing over six

million women. For years, NCWO has convened the leadership of major

women's organizations dedicated to focusing on national issues and

public policy agendas affecting women. In 1998, NCWO formed the

Women &amp; Social Security Project and launched a national education

campaign to highlight Social Security's importance to women.
