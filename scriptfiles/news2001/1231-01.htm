- December 31 - Abbott Laboratories, Argenbright, Bayer, Coke, Enron, Exxon 

Mobil, Philip Morris, Sara lee, Southern Co. and Wal-Mart have been 

named the 10 worst corporations of 2001, in Multinational Monitor 

magazine's annual listing. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These behemoths have ripped off the public, polluted the 

environment, abused their workers and debased our culture,&quot; said 

Robert Weissman, editor of Multinational Monitor. &quot;They appear in 

our lives everyday, disguised as 'respectable members of the 

community.' They deserve public opprobrium, and, in many cases, 

government sanction.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Multinational Monitor is a Washington, D.C.-based monthly 

magazine that tracks the activities of multinational corporations. 

It was founded by Ralph Nader. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abbott Laboratories made the 10 worst list for its TAP 

Pharmaceuticals, a joint venture with Japanese Takeda 

Pharmaceuticals. TAP was forced to pay $875 million to resolve 

criminal charges and civil liability in connection with allegations 

of major Medicare reimbursement fraud. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Argenbright, the security company, was named to the list for 

repeat violations of regulations for airport security. 

Argenbright's appalling record helped convince Congress to 

federalize U.S. airport security operations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bayer appears on the list for its overcharge of the government 

and public for the anti-anthrax drug Cipro, as well as dangerous 

peddling of antibiotics for poultry (contributing to antibiotic 

resistance among humans) and its harassment of a corporate 

accountability group. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Coca Cola was named among the 10 worst for its sponsorship of 

the first Harry Potter movie and possible sequels, using a 

children's favorite to hawks its unhealthy product, and for alleged 

complicity with death squads in Colombia targeting union leaders 

there. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enron made the 10 worst list for costing many of its employees 

their life savings by refusing to let them dump Enron stock from 

their pension plans, as the company plunged toward bankruptcy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ExxonMobil earned a spot on the list for leading the global 

warming denial campaign and blocking efforts at appropriate 

remedial action, plus a host of other reckless activities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philip Morris asserted its claim to be among the 10 worst by 

virtue of a &quot;we've changed&quot; marketing campaign -- revealed to be a 

hoax by a Czech study it commissioned alleging the cost savings 

from smoking-related premature death, as well as the company's 

ongoing efforts to addict millions of new smokers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sara Lee was named to the list because of a scandal involving 

its Ball Park Franks hot dogs. Contaminated hot dogs due to company 

negligence killed 21. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Southern Co., the largest electric utility in the United States, 

grabbed a place on the list for its efforts to defeat sensible air 

pollution regulations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wal-Mart secured its place among the 10 worst by mistreating 

workers domestically and abroad, and by contributing to the sprawl 

that blights the U.S. landscape. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corporations on Multinational Monitor's 10 worst list appear 

alphabetically, and are not ranked internally. </font></p>
