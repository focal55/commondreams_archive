- February 22 - The non-profit Clean Air 

Trust today awarded its clean air &quot;Villain of the Month&quot; award for 

February to the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association 

(NPRA). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The refinery lobby earned this dubious distinction by filing a 

suit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's landmark 

plan to clean up dirty diesel trucks and buses and diesel fuel. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diesel cleanup plan is one of the most important steps to 

protect public health in EPA's history: it would prevent more than 

8,000 premature deaths and more than 360,000 asthma attacks a year, 

according to EPA's own estimates. The agency calculated the public 

health benefits of the cleanup would outweigh the costs by a 

staggering factor of 16 to one. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But rather than agree to modernize its refineries, the NPRA has 

chosen to spend its money on lawyers. And the refinery lobby has 

made the outrageous assertion that California's electricity problem 

is somehow related to the clean diesel plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Too expensive to clean up? The refiners picked a bad time to 

make that argument, given that one of its prominent members, 

ExxonMobil, made more than $5 billion in profits in the last three 

months of 2000 alone. That's far more than the diesel cleanup 

would cost for the entire industry over the next five and a half 

years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cleanup is supported by an unprecedented coalition, 

including domestic and foreign auto companies, health and 

environmental groups, state and local clean-air regulators, 

pollution control equipment makers, the nation's biggest diesel 

engine maker, the California Trucking Association, and even some 

oil companies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Breathers can only hope that the Bush administration vigorously 

defends the cleanup plan in court and heeds the admonition of a 

dissident NPRA member, BP Amoco. Just this week, BP reiterated its 

support for the diesel cleanup. The cleanup technology is 

available, BP noted, adding that adequate supplies of clean diesel 

fuel can be made by the mid-2006 deadline. </font></p>
