- December 6 - Three separate terrorist attacks in Israel claimed at least 25 lives this

past weekend, and subsequent Israeli army attacks on Palestinian areas have

killed at least five people. The Palestinian group Hamas claimed

responsibility for the suicide bombings, which it said were in retaliation

for the November 23 assassination of the group's senior West Bank leader,

Mahmoud Abu Hanoud.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Echoing the response of the Bush administration, the U.S. news media have

largely blamed the attacks on Palestinian Authority leader Yasir Arafat,

despite the fact that Hamas is an unaffiliated rival of the PA. &quot;Arafat

didn't send the suicide bombers, but he didn't stop them either,&quot; reported

CBS Evening News correspondent David Hawkins (12/3/01).  Although no one has

charged that the Palestinian Authority carried out or authorized the suicide

attacks, Israeli airstrikes against Palestinian Authority headquarters and

police facilities were presented in some outlets as a direct response to the

suicide bombings, as with the December 4 New York Daily News front-page

headline: &quot;PAYBACK.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The New York Times made the Palestinian Authority's failure to arrest more

Hamas militants a major theme in its December 3 reporting and commentary.

According to a news analysis piece, &quot;Mr. Arafat's lieutenants said they

would crack down on two powerful extremist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad,

and began making arrests. Mr. Arafat had said before that he would take this

step, without doing so.&quot; The Times added that Arafat's Fatah organization

&quot;has maintained uneasy relations with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Palestinian

analysts and officials say-- relations that are likely to end if he puts

their leaders in prison and keeps them there.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper quoted Secretary of State Colin Powell as telling Arafat, &quot;You've

got to go after the organizations who are conducting these kinds of acts of

terror... putting them in real jails where they are not walking free several

days later.&quot; The Times' editorial followed the same line, warning that &quot;a

decisive moment is now at hand in which Mr. Arafat has to assert his

authority with actions, not merely words. He must, as Washington demands,

break up the terrorist organizations led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad by

arresting leaders involved in planning violence and by seizing illegally

held arms.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While it is certainly valid to investigate whether either the PA or Israel

have done enough to pursue suspected terrorists or to stop violence under

their control, the New York Times has omitted crucial facts about this

latest cycle of violence, even though the paper has reported these facts in

the past.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On August 26 of last year, Hamas' Hanoud was wounded by Israeli forces in a

shootout near the West Bank town of Nablus. Hanoud then surrendered to the

Palestinian Authority, and four days later he was sentenced to 12 years in

prison by a Palestinian military tribunal for training and arming military

groups (Associated Press, 9/2/00).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 18, Israel launched an F-16 attack on the Nablus jail where Hanoud

was being held, in an attempt to kill him. The action proved disastrous:

Eleven Palestinian police officers are believed to have died, and Hanoud

escaped (New York Times, 5/20/01). Castro Salameh, the Palestinian commander

of the Nablus post, told the Times, &quot;Abu Hanoud has been my charge for nine

months, and I have kept him under lock and key... But now Israel has

liberated him. I have absolutely no idea where he has gone to.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These facts have been reported in the New York Times, most recently in a

November 25 story about Hanoud's assassination. But the stories written

after the latest round of violence have omitted these facts. Targeting

civilians is never acceptable, but context is critical as people seek a way

out of the cycle of Mideast violence: If the Times reminded readers that the

Hamas leader whose killing sparked the recent round of violence was in a

Palestinian jail until the Israeli military tried to assassinate him, it

would put the contention that the Palestinian Authority bears most of the

responsibility for the current strife in a different light.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On December 5 the Times did report that Arafat and others believe that

Israeli attacks on Palestinian police facilities are in fact encumbering

their ability to arrest militants. But the troubling connection between

Israel's attempt to kill a prisoner in Palestinian custody and the recent

rash of bombings is still not being pointed out by the paper.</font></p>
