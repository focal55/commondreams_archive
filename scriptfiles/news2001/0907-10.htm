<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - September 7 -  Today&#146;s Federal Trade Commission approval of the Chevron - Texaco merger is good news for big oil but bad news for everyone else.  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last four years there has been a rash of mergers in the oil and gas industry - BP Amoco begat Exxon Mobil which begat BP Amoco ARCO which begat Chevron Texaco.  This merger sets up a lose--lose--lose scenario for American consumers, democracy, and the environment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumers, already paying higher prices for gasoline, will continue to lose because of the lack of competition.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy will lose, as these mega-companies will exert more and more influence over the political process.   The new ChevronTexaco will contribute to an excessive concentration of political power in a small number of huge corporations.  The original authors of the antitrust laws sought to avoid excessive concentrations of political power by the oil industry.  That is one of the reasons Standard Oil was broken up into 34 companies in 1911.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the environment will lose as both companies have an aggressive anti-environmental agenda.  Chevron is one of four companies pushing to open the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge for oil and gas drilling. Chevron is also trying to drill the first offshore drilling well off of Pensacola Beach in Florida.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PIRGs will continue to put pressure on the new Chevron Texaco to act like a socially responsible corporation.  Florida PIRG will step up its campaign to block Chevron Texaco&#146;s attempt to drill off of Florida&#146;s Panhandle, and the PIRGs will re-file a shareholder resolution calling on Chevron Texaco to stay out of the Arctic Refuge. A similar resolution filed last year was supported by more than 11 percent of Chevron shareholders.</font></p>
