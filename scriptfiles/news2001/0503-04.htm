- May 3 - Americans are unknowingly purchasing 

        fertilizers made from industrial toxic waste, turning farms and gardens 

        into dumping grounds for the waste, according to <a href="http://www.pirg.org/toxics/reports/wastelands/index.html"><i>Waste 

        Lands: The Threat of Toxic Fertilizer</i></a>, a new report released today 

        by U.S. PIRG and the State Public Interest Research Groups.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In tests commissioned by the 

        California PIRG Charitable Trust, each of twenty-nine fertilizers were 

        tested for and found to contain twenty-two toxic metals. Test results 

        for twenty fertilizers showed that they exceed levels of concern for disposal 

        in landfills. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's unacceptable for 

        fertilizer manufacturers to use farms and gardens as a dumping ground 

        for toxic waste,&quot; said Jeremiah Baumann, environmental health advocate 

        for U.S.PIRG. &quot;When industrial facilities generate toxic waste, pass 

        it off to fertilizer manufacturers, and call it recycling, they're playing 

        a dangerous game with our environment and our health.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fertilizer products become 

        contaminated when manufacturers buy toxic waste from industrial facilities 

        to obtain low-cost plant nutrients, such as zinc or iron. Such industrial 

        wastes are often highly contaminated with persistent toxic chemicals, 

        including heavy metals and dioxins. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fertilizers were purchased 

        in twelve states and tested by Frontier Geosciences, a U.S. EPA-accredited 

        independent laboratory based in Seattle, and found to contain arsenic, 

        lead, mercury, cadmium, and chromium, among other toxic metals and the 

        toxic chemical dioxin. Many of these contaminants are known to cause cancer, 

        reproductive and developmental toxicity or other serious health effects. 

        Lead, mercury, cadmium, and dioxin are not only highly toxic but also 

        known to accumulate in organisms, including in humans. Arsenic has been 

        in the public spotlight as a result of the Bush administration's decision 

        to reconsider limits on arsenic in drinking water.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results come as the U.S. 

        EPA is reviewing comments on a proposed rule to limit heavy metals and 

        dioxin for zinc fertilizers and label these fertilizers for toxic substances. 

        </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no justification 

        for putting products that contain toxic wastes on the lawns where our 

        children play, or on the land where we grow our food,&quot; said U.S. 

        PIRG's Baumann. &quot;EPA should not just be limiting the amounts of toxic 

        waste in fertilizers - they should be prohibiting toxic wastes in fertilizers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spreading the contaminants 

        found in fertilizers on farm soils is of particular concern because lead, 

        cadmium, mercury and other contaminants persist in soil for decades where 

        they can be absorbed by food crops. A California Department of Food and 

        Agriculture assessment of the health risk posed by toxic fertilizers says 

        that eating food grown with contaminated fertilizers will be the greatest 

        single source of exposure to these contaminants for commercial products.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We know that contaminants 

        in waste-derived fertilizers can get into the food chain,&quot; said Baumann. 

        &quot;Guessing at the highest 'safe level' for these contaminants is risky 

        business - and if we're wrong, it may not be possible to clean up contaminated 

        farmland.&quot;</font></p>
