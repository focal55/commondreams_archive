<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- October 25 - Since 1994, 

when the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade 

Organization came into being, more than 3 million jobs in all 50 

states and the District of Columbia have fallen victim to U.S. 

trade policies as net job losses accelerated sharply. This is the 

major finding of an analysis released today by the Economic Policy 

Institute of recently released Census Bureau data. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPI's study, &quot;Fast Track to Lost Jobs,&quot; shows that a long-term 

trend of net job losses in trade-sensitive industries accelerated 

after NAFTA and WTO. This troubling trend, which grew largely 

undetected just under the surface of the recent economic boom, 

spells trouble ahead as the downturn deepens, say EPI experts. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NAFTA and WTO have been equal opportunity destroyers, hitting 

every state without exception,&quot; said Robert Scott, the senior EPI 

economist who analyzed the job loss data. &quot;During the boom, the 

loss of good manufacturing and other trade-related jobs was masked 

by rapid growth elsewhere, primarily in the volatile high tech and 

lower-wage service sectors. Now that we're in a slowdown and the 

rest of the economy is no longer generating enough jobs to take up 

the slack, these trade-induced job losses will magnify the downward 

pressure.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The job losses revealed in &quot;Fast Track to Lost Jobs&quot; have been 

studiously ignored, even denied, by fast track supporters inside 

and outside the Bush administration, who have reported only on the 

impact of increasing exports and while ignoring the job-destroying 

impact of more rapidly increasing imports. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the U.S. economy, these trade deficit-induced job losses 

are the 600-pound gorilla in the corner,&quot; said Scott. &quot;Fast track 

supporters have ignored him because he's inconvenient -- but to 

keep doing so just makes him a greater risk.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the details reported by EPI are the following: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Nationwide, net job losses from U.S. international trade 

deficits totaled 3,044,241 from 1994 to 2000 </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- equal to 2.3 

percent of the nation's total workforce. 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Job losses have shot up six times faster since NAFTA and WTO 

than during the five years immediately before they went into 

effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

-- Every state and the District of Columbia lost jobs equaling 

at least 1.2 percent of their workforce because of U.S. trade 

policies under NAFTA and the WTO.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

-- Ten states lost more than 100,000 jobs: California 

(310,000), Texas (228,000), New York (179,000), Michigan (152,000), 

Pennsylvania (142,000), Illinois (140,000), Ohio (135,000), North 

Carolina (133,000), Indiana (103,000), and Florida (100,000). 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The 10 states suffering the highest rates of job losses are 

Rhode Island (5.8 percent), North Carolina (3.7 percent), Maine 

(3.6 percent), Tennessee (3.6 percent), Indiana (3.4 percent), 

Mississippi (3.3 percent), Michigan (3.2 percent), Alabama (3.1 

percent), Arkansas (3.1 percent), and South Carolina (3.0 percent). 

(For full list, see report, Table 2B.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

-- Nearly two out of every three jobs lost were in 

manufacturing. (1.97 million out of 3.04 million). 

</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- In some manufacturing sub-sectors, job losses rose at 

extraordinary rates: 497.2 percent in transportation equipment; 

448.6 percent in communications equipment; 363.8 percent in paper 

and allied products; 308.7 percent in petroleum refining and 

related products; and 207.5 percent in fabricated metal products 

(excluding machinery and transportation equipment).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

-- Outside manufacturing, the sectors that experienced the most 

rapid acceleration of job losses were: financial, insurance and 

real estate (201.6 percent); communications (195.6 percent); 

construction (188.8 percent); and transportation (180.9 percent). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In tracking job losses that are due to U.S. trade policies 

under NAFTA and the WTO, EPI takes into account both actual job 

losses and potential jobs, or job opportunities, lost as a result 

of increasing U.S. trade deficits. The lost opportunities are 

positions that would have been created if the trade deficit had not 

accelerated since 1994. </font></p>
