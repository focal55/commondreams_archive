concert to benefit the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the 

Million Mom March Foundation, originally scheduled for September 

20, has been rescheduled for October 2 due to the horrific 

terrorist attacks of September 11. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event, which will take place at Radio City Music Hall in New 

York City, is now dedicated to the victims of this overwhelming 

tragedy, and to generating support for a non-violent world. A 

portion of the proceeds from the concert will be donated to the 

disaster relief efforts. The concert will be hosted by Kevin Spacey 

and will feature performances by Alanis Morissette, Cyndi Lauper, 

Dave Matthews, The Isley Brothers, Lou Reed, Marc Anthony, Moby, 

Nelly Furtado, Shelby Lynne, Stone Temple Pilots, Yolanda Adams, 

and many others. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In the wake of the tragic events last week in New York and 

Washington, D.C., it has been brought home, for many of us very 

personally, that every life is important,&quot; said Michael D. Barnes, 

President of the Brady Center. &quot;Not one life should be lost to 

senseless acts of violence. Now more than ever, we must redouble 

our efforts to prevent gun violence in America. Our work to 

prevent deaths in America must continue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Like the rest of the nation, our hearts and thoughts are with 

the victims of this unspeakable crime and with the families they 

have left behind. Therefore, in addition to the general concert 

proceeds that will be donated to the disaster relief efforts, the 

Brady Center will contribute additional funds from every ticket we 

sell for this benefit concert to support the victims and their 

families.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concert, entitled COME TOGETHER: A Night For John Lennon's 

Words &amp; Music, Dedicated to New York &amp; Its People, is hosted by 

Turner Network Television (TNT), in association with Yoko Ono 

Lennon and Ken Ehrlich Productions. The concert will take place at 

Radio City Music Hall at 8 p.m. on October 2, and will be broadcast 

live on TNT. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence united 

with the Million Mom March, the concert will benefit relief 

organizations including the American Red Cross, September 11th 

Fund, International Association of Fire Fighters, New York 

Fraternal Order of Police WTC Fund, The National Organization for 

Victim Assistance, and The Twin Towers Fund, and the Violence 

Policy Center. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A limited number of tickets for the benefit concert are still 

available from The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For
