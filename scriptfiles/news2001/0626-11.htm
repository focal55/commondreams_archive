- June 26 - U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), a staunch advocate for

labor protections, today introduced groundbreaking legislation to strengthen the

basic rights of workers to organize and to join a union.  The Right-to-Organize

Act of 2001 addresses the serious shortcomings of the National Labor Relations

Act (NLRA) that, over the years, have eroded the framework of worker empowerment

which the NLRA was designed to ensure.  Wellstone, now Chairman of the Senate

Subcommittee on  Employment, Safety, and Training with jurisdiction over the

National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), said the bill will shore up the crumbling

foundation of democracy in the workplace that the NLRA was intended to promote,

and targets the worst abuses of labor law that have become all too common in

recent years.     </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The need for labor law reform is urgent &#150; not only for workers who seek to join

together and bargain collectively, but for all Americans.  One of the most

important things we can do to raise the standard of living and quality of life

for working Americans, raise wages and benefits, improve health and safety in

the workplace, and give average Americans more control over their lives is to

enforce their right to organize, join, and belong to a union.  The right to

organize will be one of the most important civil rights and human rights causes

of the 21st century.  Congress must restore that right to its proper place,&#148;

said Wellstone.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All to often across America, workers who choose to organize, participate, or

voice their concerns about the terms and conditions of their workplace live in

fear - fear of being harassed, of losing wages and benefits, of being put on

leave without pay  &#150; and ultimately fear of losing their jobs because they

choose to exercise their legal rights to associate for the purposes of

bargaining collectively and participating in decision-making about their own

workplaces. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated that 10,000 Americans lose their jobs illegally every year just

for supporting union organizing campaigns.  The 1994 Dunlop Commission found

that one in four employers illegally fired union activists during organizing

campaigns.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employers regularly fire workers and engage in other unfair labor practices to

discourage union organizing and union representation.  They do it with virtual

impunity because today&#146;s labor laws simply are too weak to discourage management

from doing so.   Employers routinely monopolize

the debates leading up to union certification elections, and drag out election

campaigns to give themselves more time to harass workers and create a climate of

fear and intimidation.  There also is the growing problem of employers refusing

to bargain with their employees even after a union has been duly certified. 

Achieving so-called &#147;first contracts&#148; can often be as,  or more,  harrowing than

the organizing effort itself.

Wellstone&#146;s Right-to-Organize Act of 2001 is a first step in tackling the more

serious obstacles to labor organizing.  The Act would do the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amend the National Labor Relations Act to provide equal time to labor

organizations to provide information about union representation. Under this

proposal the employer would trigger the equal time provision by expressing

opinions on union representation during work hours or at the work site.  Once

the triggering actions occur, then the union would be entitled to equal time to

use the same media used by the employer to distribute information and be allowed

access to the work site to communicate with employees.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Toughen penalties for wrongful discharge violations.   In particular, the bill

would require the National Labor Relations Board to award back pay equal to 3

times the employee&#146;s wages when the Board finds that an employee is discharged

as a result of an unfair labor practice.  It also would allow employees to file

civil actions to recover punitive damages when they have been discharged as a

result of an unfair labor practice.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Require expedited elections in cases where a supermajority of workers have

signed union recognition cards designating a union as the employee&#146;s labor

organization.   In particular, it would require elections within 14 days after

receipt of signed union recognition cards from 60 percent of the employees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Erect mediation and arbitration procedures to help employers and employees reach

mutually agreeable first-contract collective bargaining agreements.   The bill

would require mediation if the parties cannot reach agreement on their own after

60 days.  Should the parties not reach agreement 30 days after a mediator is

selected, then either party could call in the Federal Mediation and Conciliation

Service for binding arbitration. In this way both parties would have incentives

to reach genuine agreement without allowing either side to hold the other

hostage indefinitely to unrealistic proposals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;When workers join together to fight for job security, for dignity, for economic

justice and for a fair share of America's prosperity, it is not a struggle

merely for their own benefit.  The gains of unionized workers on

bread-and-butter issues are key to the economic security of all working

families.   Upholding the right to organize is a way to advance important social

objectives -- higher wages, better benefits, more pension coverage, more worker

training, more health insurance coverage, and safer work places -- for all

Americans without creating any government programs to get us there,&#148; Wellstone

said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wellstone also joined Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today as an original co-sponsor

of The Workplace Fairness Act.  That bill amends the NLRA and the Railway Labor

Act to prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacement workers during a

strike, or giving employment preference to cross-over employees.   It also makes

it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to allow a striking worker

to return to work if that worker has unconditionally offered to return to work.

Together with The Right-to-Organize Act of 2001, these measures produce the

basic platform for healthy economies, healthy communities, and healthy families.
