- April 17 - Despite

seemingly expensive gas prices, drivers pay less than half of

the costs created by the use of their automobiles when the total

costs of driving-including increased congestion, space covered

by pavement, accidents, and pollution-are considered. A

Redefining Progress issue brief released today explains how

everyone (non-drivers, taxpayers, and other drivers) pays every

time a driver gets behind the wheel.

<p>The issue brief, "Beyond Gas Taxes: Linking Driving Fees to

Externalities," explores other options that charge drivers for

the social costs created by automobile use. While in the past

this option has meant higher gas taxes, the paper argues for

other pricing options tailored toward preventing specific harms.

For example, charging for highway use during rush hour could be

used to ease traffic problems, and pay-as-you-drive insurance

could reduce automobile crashes.

<p>"A driver pays for gasoline, insurance, and repairs in order

to derive the benefits of driving, but not for the traffic and

pollution that affect nearby people," writes Redefining Progress

Accurate Prices Program Director Mark M. Glickman. "There simply

aren't financial incentives for drivers to take these costs into

account when they drive, so as a society we all drive more than

we would like."

<p>The issue brief also addresses the regressivity of driving

fees. While this is a serious concern, doing nothing to improve

our transportation problems will also affect low-income

households disproportionately. The paper argues that while there

is a need to soften the financial impact of any new driving fees

on lower-income people, it is also create viable, convenient,

and affordable alternatives to owning and using cars.

<p>The issue brief is available for download from the Redefining

Progress Web site <a href="http://www.rprogress.org">(http://www.rprogress.org).</a>
