- May 18 - Michael D. Barnes, President of Handgun Control, today criticized U.S. Secretary of Interior Gale Norton's appearance as a keynote speaker at the National Rifle Association's (NRA) annual convention in Kansas City, Mo., this weekend: &quot;The fact that a cabinet secretary will be a keynote speaker at an NRA convention is more proof that the NRA - true to the NRA's boasting during the 2000 elections - is, indeed, working out of the White House, and enjoying what they predicted: 'unbelievably friendly relations' with the entire Bush Administration.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At an NRA activist meeting held in California in February 2000, NRA First Vice President Kayne B. Robinson alluded to Governor W. Bush saying: &quot;If we win we'll have a president, with at least one of the people that's running, a president where we work out of their office - unbelievably friendly relations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barnes noted that the new gun safety proposal that President Bush unveiled earlier this week focuses completely on enforcement and ignores prevention. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The President simply echoed the NRA rhetoric that the United States needs only to enforce existing laws, not enact new ones. While we fully support strong enforcement of our gun laws, we recognize that we must adopt a multi-faceted approach in order to win the fight to prevent gun violence. Enforcement is only as good as the laws that are in place, and, thanks to the extremist gun lobby, including the NRA, our gun laws have too many loopholes that allow criminals and juveniles to get guns.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These loopholes were created by the NRA, and they are lobbying hard to safeguard them. By sending a member of his cabinet to represent the Bush Administration at the NRA's annual convention, President Bush is endorsing the dangerous agenda of the gun lobby,&quot; Barnes said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the sake of our children and for truly safer American neighborhoods, we call upon the Bush Administration to listen to the majority of the American public instead of the extremist gun lobby and embrace the prevention and safety measures that can save lives,&quot; Barnes said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Handgun Control, chaired by Sarah Brady, was founded in 1974 by Dr. Mark Borinsky and N.T. &quot;Pete&quot; Shields, two victims of gun violence. Based in Washington, D.C., HCI works with law enforcement, public health, religious, and community groups across the country to strengthen and protect federal, state and local gun control laws, but does not seek to ban all guns. HCI has more than 400,000 members nationwide, making it the nation&Iacute;s largest citizens&Iacute; gun control lobbying organization. More information about HCI and its sister organization, the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, can be found on our website at <a href="http://www.handguncontrol.org">www.handguncontrol.org</a></i></font></p>
