<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - October 18 - There are indications 

that the Senate Judiciary Committee plans to consider this 

afternoon several judicial nominees, including a controversial 

nominee to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, Charles Pickering, at 

a hearing that could be in effect closed to the public due to 

security measures on Capitol Hill. People For the American Way 

President Ralph G. Neas today urged Judiciary Committee Chairman 

Patrick Leahy not to hold closed-door hearings on any judicial 

nominees. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;De facto closed-door hearings on federal judicial nominees are 

undemocratic and unacceptable,&quot; said Neas. &quot;People For the 

American Way urges Senator Leahy not to establish a precedent that 

undermines the principles of open and accountable government and 

shuts the public out of this critically important process.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reportedly the hearing might be inaccessible to the public due 

to security precautions that have shut Senate office buildings 

temporarily and put restrictions on public access to the Capitol. 

Neas said the hearing on nominations to lifetime positions on the 

federal bench should be postponed if the public cannot be 

guaranteed access to the hearing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Considering these judicial nominees is not a matter of national 

security, or of such great urgency that we must violate fundamental 

principles of democratic government,&quot; said Neas. &quot;In particular, 

there are many reasons to postpone the hastily scheduled hearing on 

Judge Pickering so that the public can make sure that senators have 

time to thoroughly consider the nominee's record.&quot; Neas said that 

if the hearing goes forward, the Judiciary Committee must hold a 

second hearing, accessible to the public, after the transcript of 

the first hearing is made available. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is particularly important in this time of crisis that we 

affirm, rather than abandon, the principles of democratic 

self-governance,&quot; said Neas. </font></p>

<p></p>
