- February 15 -  Tens of thousands of

Americans have demonstrated their support of reproductive rights to

commemorate the Presidents' Day holiday on Feb. 19, by making

contributions to Planned Parenthood in the name of President George

W. Bush.

<p>Planned Parenthood reported today that an estimated $500,000 has

been raised and 15,000 individuals have made contributions to Planned

Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliates around the

country in response to this campaign -- many are first-time

supporters of the organization.

<p>Dozens of volunteers and Planned Parenthood staff in the

organization's Washington office are preparing the mail bags stuffed

with the personal messages. The mail bags will be hand-delivered by

Planned Parenthood to the new Executive Office Building on 17th

Street, in Washington, D.C., tomorrow afternoon.

<p>The grassroots mobilization took off on e-mail and various

Internet chat sites two weeks ago after Los Angeles Times columnist

Patt Morrison suggested in her column that making a donation to

Planned Parenthood was a fitting message to send to President George

W. Bush on Presidents' Day in response to his reinstating the "global

gag rule" and appointing John Ashcroft as U.S. attorney general.

<p>PPFA, the nation's largest reproductive health and rights

organization, responded to the overwhelming interest in the campaign

circulating over the Internet by setting up a "Planned Parenthood

Presidents' Day Message Campaign" on the organization's Web site at

www.plannedparenthood.org.

<p>The site allows visitors to simultaneously make a donation to the

organization while sending a personal message that will be forwarded

to President Bush. Messages posted to date run the gamut from simple

statements of support for reproductive rights to tributes from

grandmothers who lived through harrowing personal experiences during

the years before the fundamental right to choose safe and legal

abortion was recognized by the Supreme Court 28 years ago in Roe v.

Wade.

<p>Sample messages to the president being returned with

contributions:

<p>Dear President Bush:

<p>"You promised to be a uniter rather than a divider. You kept your

promise by causing women everywhere to shudder in unison at your plan

to dismantle reproductive rights. I hope you will reconsider this

plan."

-- Dale City, Calif.

<p>"You are the current resident of the White House. Please be aware

that you did not win the popular vote. Your position on a woman's

right to choose is a primary reason for that fact."

-- Louis Park, Minn.

<p>"I'm a college student that always wants the ability to choose

what I want for my body without anyone telling me what I can or

cannot do. Don't you think that your daughters feel the same way that

I do?"

-- Washington, D.C.

<p>"We, like millions of other Americans, believe that reproductive

rights are important. We understand that you disagree, but we will

not support any attempt on your part to stack our Supreme Court with

anti-choice justices."

-- Tacoma, Wash.

<p>"Mr. Bush, I have contributed to Planned Parenthood as a statement

that you do not have the consent of the people of the United States

to deny women of the U.S. and the world the right to make our own

decisions about our bodies and our beliefs."

-- New York, N.Y.

<p><i>Planned Parenthood Federation of America is the world's largest and

most trusted voluntary family planning organization. It comprises
