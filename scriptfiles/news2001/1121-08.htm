- November 21 - With the next round of negotiations on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) set to begin tomorrow, the political influence of tobacco transnationals is emerging as a key issue. A report released today documents new evidence of tobacco industry attempts to undermine public health and tobacco control policies around the world. The report, Tobacco Transnational Activity to Undermine Tobacco Control Policy and the FCTC-May to September 2001, has examples of tobacco industry influence from Nigeria to the Philippines, and was compiled by Infact for the Network for Accountability of Tobacco Transnationals (NATT). NGOs are calling on countries in every region of the world to rein in the political influence of Big Tobacco in this third round of negotiations on the treaty

<p>



“Since the negotiations in May, the tobacco industry has been working feverishly to derail public health policy globally. The stakes are high at this round of talks and the world will be watching. It is up to each country to stand up to the economic bullies that are the tobacco transnationals, and prioritize public health over corporate profits,” says Lucinda Wykle-Rosenberg of Infact.</p><p>



Particular scrutiny will be paid to the US position, which will be represented by an almost entirely new team of delegates. The top US negotiator for the FCTC, Tom Novotny, resigned since the last round of talks saying, “It is not the same job I took two years ago.” Other evidence of tobacco industry influence on the US is documented in the report released today. Earlier this week US Representative Henry Waxman issued a letter accusing the Bush administration of marching in lockstep with Big Tobacco to undermine or eliminate serious global regulations to curb tobacco use. </p><p>

In the letter, Representative Waxman states, “Congress and the American public deserve a full explanation for why your negotiators have attempted undermine the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.”</p><p>



While the US, Brazil, and the European Union have all drawn sharp criticism recently for their positions on the treaty, the African region has been hailed for its leadership. Last month at a regional WHO meeting, African countries articulated a tough stance on the treaty’s central issues in the “Algiers Declaration.” In a bold challenge to tobacco transnationals, the African region denounced a recent tobacco industry proposal for self-regulation as an attempt to derail the FCTC. </p><p>





“African nations are setting the bar high in an effort to protect the continent from the kind of tobacco epidemic that has already hit other areas of the world. We are calling on every country, particularly those that are home to transnational tobacco corporations, to reject the influence of the tobacco industry,” says Akinbode Oluwafemi of Environmental Rights Action.</p><p>



With the announced departure of Ambassador Amorim of Brazil as Chair of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, a controversial issue that could surface during this round of negotiations is the naming of the next Chair. With the recent weakening of Brazil’s resolve on the FCTC, there is speculation about pressure from tobacco transnationals on the Brazilian government. South Africa has expressed interest in serving as the next Chair, and NATT members point out that the African region has taken a leadership role in the FCTC, and that South Africa would be the stronger choice of the two. 

</p><p>

“The selection of the next Chair should not be allowed to derail these negotiations. What countries need to do is ensure a treaty that protects public health policy from the tobacco transnationals, prioritizes public health over trade, bans tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, holds the tobacco transnationals accountable for harms, and provides financial assistance for countries to convert from tobacco to other forms of production,” says Bejon Misra of VOICE (India).</p><p>
