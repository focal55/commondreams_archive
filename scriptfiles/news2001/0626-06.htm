<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- June 26 - Testifying at the U.S. Department of Energy&#146;s (DOE) public hearings in the District of Columbia today, U.S. PIRG Legislative Director Anna Aurilio criticized the Bush Administration&#146;s energy plan and called for a dramatic increase in funding for energy efficiency and clean, renewable sources of energy.  The public interest organization also called for effective standards to increase automobile fuel economy, reduce power plant pollution and ensure that a significant portion of the nation&#146;s energy comes from clean, renewable sources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to U.S. PIRG&#146;s Aurilio, &#147;President Bush&#146;s energy plan is dirty, dangerous, and doesn&#146;t deliver for consumers.  It&#146;s a recipe for more drilling, more spilling, more asthma attacks, more nuclear waste, and more global warming pollution.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush&#146;s proposal calls for the construction of 1,300 new power plants, more than one per week for the next 20 years, in order to meet expected future demand.  U.S. PIRG points out that, according to a recent DOE report, 60% of future electricity demand could be met by increasing efficiency and production of clean renewable energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Across the country, the public and Congress have voiced dissatisfaction with the Bush Administration&#146;s energy plan.  For example, at the recent DOE public hearing in Denver, only one person out of 88 testifying spoke in support of the Administration plan.  Meanwhile, the House of Representatives voted last week to prevent energy exploration in national monuments and offshore drilling on Florida&#146;s coast, key elements of the President&#146;s plan.<br>

 <br>

&#147;Americans deserve a smarter, cleaner energy future,&#148; said Aurilio. &#147;This means increasing funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs and implementing higher standards for automobile fuel economy, power plant pollution and renewable energy. The President can provide a clean, reliable energy plan that would save consumers money, while at the same time protecting the public&#146;s health.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. PIRG offered the following recommendations to the Department of Energy:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increase Funding for Energy Efficiency: Every dollar invested in energy efficiency programs returns up to $42 in energy savings. The President has proposed cutting funding for most energy efficiency programs by one third.  U.S. PIRG calls for an increase in funding for energy efficiency research, development and implementation by at least $170 million in FY2002.  U.S. PIRG opposes funding for the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles or any other programs that subsidize dirty diesel engines.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increase Funding for Clean, Renewable Energy: DOE programs have cut the cost of renewable energy production so much that wind energy is now cost competitive with natural gas.  The Bush Administration proposes to cut funding for renewable research by nearly half (from $376 million to $186 million).  U.S. PIRG recommends increasing federal funding to $750 million annually for research and development of clean renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal. <br>

<br>

 </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eliminate Funding for Coal, Oil and Nuclear Programs:  Promoting continued reliance on coal, oil and nuclear energy means advocating more air pollution, oil spills and more radioactive waste.  President Bush proposes spending $2 billion on coal subsidies over the next 10 years, while at the same time continuing funding dangerous nuclear power research programs.  U.S. PIRG recommends cutting subsidies for fossil fuel and nuclear power programs.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set Strong Standards for Auto Fuel Efficiency:  The President&#146;s energy plan delays any decision on improving auto fuel efficiency standards, which have been stalled for 16 years.  U.S. PIRG recommends increasing fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks to 40 miles per gallon.  According to a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, this standard would avert 374 million tons of global warming pollution annually, while saving drivers $16 billion per year at the gas pump.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set Standards to Increase Renewable Energy Generation: U.S. PIRG urges the President to promote a renewable energy standard requiring that 20% of America&#146;s electricity comes from clean, renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal power by 2020.  U.S. PIRG does not support hydropower or municipal solid waste incineration.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set Standards to Clean Up Power Plant Pollution: Coal-fired power plants are a leading source of smog and soot, particles blamed for acid rain and mercury in our air and water.  They are also responsible for 27% of U.S. global warming pollution.  U.S. PIRG urges the President to commit to emission reductions of the four main power plant pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and mercury.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Unfortunately President Bush has proposed an energy plan that protects the polluters instead of the public,&#148; concluded Aurilio.  &#147;We need a smarter, cleaner energy future that provides reliable power, protects the environment, and saves consumers money.&#148; </font></p>
