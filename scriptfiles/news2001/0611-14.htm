- June 11 -  News Advisory:

<p>What: Press Conference Presenting 50,000 Voices Urging

Congress to Oppose National Missile Defense

<p>When: 12 Noon, Tuesday, June 12th

<p>Where: House Triangle

<p>Who: Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), represented

by Past President Dr. Peter Wilk, will be presenting members of

Congress with a petition representing the 10,000 signatures

gathered by PSR in opposition to the wasteful, dangerous

National Missile Defense. Wilk will present a blow-up of the

petition, which calls the NMD system 'a prescription for

disaster.' Expected to attend are Wilk's own member of Congress

Tom Allen (D-ME), as well as US Representatives Barney Frank

(D-MA), Bob Filner (D-CA), Rush Holt (D-NJ) and Jan Schakowsky

(D-IL).

<p>The petition continues, "(NMD) is costly, technologically

unproven and would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

Rather than addressing an existing threat, it will increase

tensions with other nuclear powers."

<p>PSR gathered the signatures from members and others in

response to the Bush Administration's plans to forge ahead with

NMD despite countless failed tests and opposition from allies

and adversaries alike. PSR is a member of Project Abolition and

the Nuclear Disarmament Partnership, whose other members will be

presenting 40,000 more signatures opposing the National Missile

Defense program. Also presented at the press conference will be

a letter signed by more than 600 non-governmental organizations

from around the world opposing the system and calling on

President Bush and other world leaders to turn away from the

Missile Defense boondoggle.

<p>The press conference represents the culmination of three days

of action, kicked off Sunday with a rally in Lafayette Park and

continuing Monday and Tuesday with Congressional Education

meetings featuring activists from around the country.

<p>Interviews are available.

<p><i>PSR represents more than 20,000 physicians and other health

professionals and is dedicated to the abolition of nuclear

weapons, the safety of our environment and the end of violence

and its causes. PSR is the US affiliate of International

Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and shares in

IPPNW's 1985 Nobel Prize for Peace.
