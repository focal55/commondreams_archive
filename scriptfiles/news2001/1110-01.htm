<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MARRAKECH, MOROCCO  

- November  10 - As environment 

ministers from 160 countries agreed on rules for the Kyoto climate 

treaty, World Wildlife Fund called on governments today to turn the 

agreement into international law by next September's World Summit 

on Sustainable Development. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In concluding the Marrakech Accord, ministers have confounded 

critics of the agreement, led by the Bush Administration, which had 

declared the agreement &quot;dead&quot; earlier this spring. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The phoenix of the Kyoto Protocol has risen in Marrakech,&quot; said 

Jennifer Morgan, Director of WWF's Climate Change Campaign. &quot;There 

can be no further excuse for governments to delay taking the next 

step of ratifying the treaty before next September's Johannesburg 

Summit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite vigorous efforts by its opponents, the Kyoto climate 

treaty has bounced back from its low point last November when 

negotiations stalled in The Hague. The accord maintains the 

essential architecture of last July's Bonn Agreement, the landmark 

political agreement opening the way to bringing Kyoto into force. 

The accord contains rules on a compliance regime with enforceable 

and binding consequences for countries that do not meet 

their Kyoto commitments. Ministers also completed the final details 

of the package for reporting and reviewing countries' inventories, 

setting in place a sound system based on IPCC methodologies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rules were also finalized for Joint Implementation projects 

under which industrialized countries will earn carbon 

credits by investing in cleaner technologies in each other's 

countries. Similarly, ministers concluded the rules for 

the Clean Development Mechanism, which will commence almost 

immediately. Today's agreement also formalizes the pledge made in 

Bonn channeling an additional Euro 450 million annually to 

developing countries from 2005. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF is concerned, however, that ministers failed to include a 

terms of reference for the work program for sinks in the CDM and 

included more carbon credits for forest management carbon in 

Russia. Nonetheless, WWF believes that the missing safeguards will 

have no fundamental impact on the overall emissions target of the 

Protocol. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The talks were not without their problems. Late on Thursday 

evening, negotiations were drawing to a conclusion 

as the European Union and developing nations reached agreement on 

a package proposal tabled by the President. This was summarily 

vetoed by Japan, Russia, Canada and Australia which insisted on 

further concessions beyond those they had already extracted from 

the international community during July's Bonn meeting. 

Negotiations continued late into Friday evening. The final barriers 

to the successful conclusion of the accord were finally removed by 

good will by all countries to finalize the agreement and move on to 

ratification. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to the weaknesses of the Protocol, environmental 

groups vowed in Marrakech to prevent damaging projects from going 

ahead that exploit loopholes already written into the Protocol. 

WWF's focus will now shift to widening business and public 

involvement in measures that achieve Kyoto's emission reduction 

goals, placing the emphasis on an enormous range of a string of 

cost-effective domestic actions. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Czech Republic has recently joined Romania in having 

ratified Kyoto. New Zealand previously a critic of 

key aspects of Kyoto -- was among countries announcing in Marrakech 

that it would ratify the treaty. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Kyoto Protocol was ready for ratification after July's Bonn 

Agreement,&quot; said Morgan. &quot;The Marrakech accord takes it a 

significant step farther forward and sends an even stronger signal 

to the shrinking ranks of doubters in politics and in business to 

join in tackling global warming.&quot; </font></p>
