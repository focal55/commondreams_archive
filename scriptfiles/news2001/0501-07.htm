- May 1 - Following is the statement 

by Judith C. Appelbaum, vice-president, National Women's Law Center 

on worthy wage day: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, in the nation's Capitol and around the country, child 

care workers are speaking out for better wages, benefits and 

working conditions. We are here today because we are on their side. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a women's organization, we understand that women have a 

double stake in how our nation's child care teachers are treated. 

Overwhelmingly, child care teachers are women - and these 

hardworking women deserve compensation that is commensurate with 

the challenging and important responsibilities they carry. At the 

same time, over 70 percent of American women with children are now 

in the paid workforce -- which means these women and their families 

must have access to affordable, high-quality child care. And we 

know that child care will not be high quality if the workers who 

provide it do not receive decent compensation for their work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is it any wonder that there is a child care crisis in this 

country? Despite the critical role that child care workers play in 

the lives of our children, they are among the nation's lowest-paid 

workers. In 1999, the average hourly wage for a child care worker 

was $7.42, or $15,430 annually based on a 52 week year and a 40 

hour week. Sadly, child care workers earn far less annually than 

bus drivers ($26,450), barbers ($20,970), and even pet sitters 

($17,160). Poor compensation results in a high turnover rate for 

child care workers, and as the latest report from the Center for 

Childcare Workforce indicates, half of the workers who leave their 

child care jobs will leave the child care field permanently. Sadly, 

it is children who suffer most because the quality of child care 

declines when turnover is high and child care wages are low. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, we applaud Senator Christopher Dodd and Representatives 

George Miller and Ben Gilman, and their co-sponsors, who are 

introducing legislation that will begin to address this pressing 

problem. The Focus on Committed and Underpaid Staff For Children's 

Sake Act - the &quot;FOCUS&quot; Act -- will promote quality child care by 

providing financial assistance to states for programs to increase 

the education and retention of skilled child care workers. The 

FOCUS Act will help child care workers get a higher education in 

fields that are related to the care and development of children by 

providing annual scholarships in amounts up to $1,500 per year. It 

will encourage child care workers who have attained a credential or 

higher degree to remain in the child care field by making retention 

grants available to them to supplement their low wages. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We don't have to look far for proof that increasing the training 

and compensation of child care workers improves the quality of 

child care. Last year, the National Women's Law Center released a 

groundbreaking study, Be All That We Can Be: Lessons from the 

Military for Improving our Nation's Child Care System. This report 

showed how the U.S. military successfully transformed a seriously 

deficient child care system into one that now serves as a model for 

child care reforms nationwide. One of the key findings was that as 

caregivers in the military system began to receive better 

compensation - and increased training tied to compensation 

increases -- staff turnover was reduced dramatically, and staff 

morale and professionalism improved. And of course, it's the kids 

who benefit the most when this happens. If we can do this for 

children in military child care, we can and must make the same 

commitment for American families who do not happen to be in the 

military. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FOCUS Act will lead to the development and support of state 

programs to increase child care teacher compensation, reduce 

teacher turnover, and ultimately improve the quality of child care 

across the United States. It's a proposal that everyone here today, 

those taking action in the states, and every American who cares 

about the nation's future, can get behind. After all, our children 

deserve nothing less. </font></p>
