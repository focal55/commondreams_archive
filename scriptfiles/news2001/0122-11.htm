- January 22 - Following is a

statement by Planned Parenthood Federation of America on

re-imposition of the "Mexico City Policy":

<p>On his first full day in office, Bush has launched the latest

wave in his assault on women's reproductive rights. He has

issued a memorandum that reinstates the Reagan-era Mexico City

policy, which denied U.S. funding to any foreign

non-governmental organizations that provided abortion services,

counseling or referrals.

<p>President Bush imposed this policy today because he says he

does not support using taxpayer funds to perform or "promote"

abortions overseas. They don't. Current law already prohibits

using U.S. taxpayer funds to perform abortions or lobby for or

against it. At the heart of the policy, and what makes it so

intrusive and far-reaching, is that it would control what

foreign recipients of U.S. international family planning

assistance do and say with their own funds.

<p>Furthermore, with this memorandum, the U.S. government comes

between a woman and her healthcare provider. It creates a

culture of fear among those best equipped to address the health

needs of women and their families around the world.

<p>"This action threatens global progress to provide life-saving

family planning and reproductive health services to millions of

women and men around the world," said Gloria Feldt, president of

Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
