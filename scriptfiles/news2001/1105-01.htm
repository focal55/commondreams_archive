- November 5 - Thirty-six organizations today sent President George Bush a letter asking him to eliminate the restrictions on free speech imposed by the <a href="http://www.crlp.org/hill_ggr.html" target="_new">global gag rule</a>.  Noting America's renewed commitment to liberty, signatories to the letter assert that there could be no more appropriate time for the president to lift the gag on free speech.  

<P>

The Senate has recently passed language eliminating the global gag rule as part of the appropriations process.  Sometimes called the “Mexico City policy”, the gag prohibits overseas non-governmental organizations from using their own funds to provide abortion services, counseling, and referral.  Groups are also forbidden from speaking out in favor of abortion law reform.

<P>

The full text of the letter is as follows:

<P>

November 5, 2001<BR>

President George W. Bush<BR>

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<BR>

Washington, D.C. 20500<BR>

<P>   

Dear Mr. President:

<P>   	

In these difficult times, Americans have renewed their commitment to protecting the liberties that make this nation great:  the right to freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion.  

<P>

<B>There could not be a more appropriate time for you, the leader of the free world, to lift the gag on free speech by suspending the undemocratic “Mexico City Policy.” </B> This global gag rule sets a lower standard for the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association for our allies abroad than we enjoy in the United States.  The gag rule denies U.S. family planning assistance to foreign non-governmental organizations that, <B>with their own non-U.S. funds,</B> either promote abortion law reform or provide the full range of legal reproductive health services, including abortion, counseling and referrals.  Speech about abortion rights is censored, while anti-abortion groups that receive U.S. funds may speak freely.

<P>

<B>Now more than ever, U.S. policy must strive to impress upon the world what we truly stand for. </B> The Mexico City Policy gag on speech and the ability to participate in law reform is a direct affront to American values.  We are exporting a policy that is contrary to our Constitution and one that could not be imposed in the United States.

<P>

The Senate included a provision in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act that would eliminate the global gag rule.  We commend the Senate for consistently standing against these undemocratic restrictions and urge Senators to remain steadfast in conference committee negotiations.  

<P>

<B>Mr. President, we urge you to join the Senate in demonstrating that the United States is committed to the universality of human rights and civil liberties by eliminating the global gag rule.</B>

<P>

Sincerely,

<P>
