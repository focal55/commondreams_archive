- November 7 - The United States 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San

Francisco overturned today a $5 billion punitive damages award against

Exxon Mobil Corporation in the worst oil spill in U.S. history and ordered

a district court to set a new, lower amount.</font>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Anyone who thought we could count on the Courts to ensure that the oil

industry keeps its promises, and acts responsibly, has had a wake up call

today,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope.  &quot;Once again, when

we match the promises of 'clean, safe, environmentally responsible oil

development' against reality, the promises lose. The oil industry always

has, and apparently always will, cut corners, and take risks -- and the

courts will only slap them on the wrist.&quot;</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A high punitive fine is necessary for one of the world's largest

corporations that acted in an irresponsible fashion. Exxon harmed the

environment and threatened the livelihood of Alaskans,&quot; continued Pope.

&quot;The award amount must set an example that not even Exxon can run amok and

get away with it. Is $5 billion excessive for Exxon? No. A lower fine sends

a message that you can get away with it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska was the worst oil spill in U.S.

history, spilling 11 million gallons of oil that harmed local fish and

wildlife and damaged commercial fishing in the area. In the 1994 trial, a

jury ordered Exxon to pay approximately $287 million in compensatory

damages to commercial salmon and herring fishermen, plus $5 billion in

punitive damages for behavior that led to the 1989 oil spill.</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Exxon claims the award wiped out a year's worth of profits for their oil

company,&quot; explained Pope. &quot;Well it wiped out much more than a year's worth

of livelihoods for many Alaskans and for wildlife. This disaster became an

icon for corporate irresponsibility. It won't send a strong message for our

future if they are only given a slap in the wrist.&quot;
