- June 4 - Sierra Club activists rallied at President Bush's

photo opportunity outside the Everglades National Park today, calling on

President Bush to stop his plans to exploit and destroy fragile, coastal

areas, national wildlife refuges, and other wild lands for oil and gas

exploration.  Sierra Club members also chastised the Bush administration

for calling for a review of the ban on building a commercial airport at the

Homestead Air Force Base.  The Air Force decided against allowing Homestead

to be converted into a commercial airport in January.  The Sierra Club will

also run a print advertisement on Tuesday, asking President Bush to keep

his promise not to drill off Florida's Gulf Coast.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans don't want oil drills looming off of our beaches or roaring jets

polluting our national parks,&quot; said Carl Pope, executive director of the

Sierra Club. &quot;Instead of trying to use our national parks as green

camouflage, it would be more honest if President Bush was standing in front

of an off-shore drilling rig.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the May 25, 2001 Chicago Tribune, President Bush favors

drilling off the coast of Florida in Lease Sale 181, in the Gulf of Mexico.

While campaigning at the Florida Republican Party Convention in October

1999, President Bush promised to work with Governor Jeb Bush to support an

offshore drilling ban in Florida.  Now, he appears to be bowing under

pressure from the oil industry and is clearly out of step with Floridians

and all Americans who do not want our fragile, coastal areas spoiled by oil

spills and industrial pollution.  In addition, President Bush is

considering oil and gas development in wildlife refuges, national monuments

and other public lands.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We can meet our energy needs without ruining our favorite beaches and

coastlines,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;President Bush's energy plan takes a drill,

dig and destroy approach to finding fossil fuel.  Instead, Americans want a

balanced approach that gives us quicker, cleaner, cheaper and safer

solutions, like energy-efficient technologies, renewable power like solar

and wind, and responsible production.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In just a few short months, the Bush Administration has advocated drilling

for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other special places.

They have also opened the door to logging in our last wild National

Forests, delayed regulations to clean up pollution from hard rock mining in

public lands, and proposed undercutting citizen involvement in the nation's

premiere wildlife habitat protection law--the Endangered Species Act. The

Bush Budget emphasizes mineral development for the coal, oil and gas

industries at the expense of sound land management programs.
