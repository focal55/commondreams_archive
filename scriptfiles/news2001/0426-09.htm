- April 26 - &quot;With so much violence against women, it is shameful for Congress to exploit this important issue to further its anti-abortion agenda,&quot; said NOW Executive Vice President Kim Gandy. &quot;Today's vote was not meant to protect women; it was meant to lay the groundwork for dismantling Roe v. Wade.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House's conservative majority quickly passed (252 to 172) the so-called Unborn Victims of Violence Act (UVVA H.R.503/S.480), which creates a penalty for anyone convicted of harming a fetus during commission of a federal crime. The UVVA would give separate legal status to any fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus, even if the woman is unaware she's pregnant. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This bill is being sold as an effort to deter violence against women, but it ignores the pregnant woman. It is nothing more than a poorly disguised attempt to elevate fetal rights,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;The sponsors of this bill have purposely crafted legislation intended to redefine the legal status of a fertilized egg as a human being. This is a fundamental challenge to a woman's right to abortion, and is a direct threat to Roe v. Wade.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Their intention became clear when the House rejected a compromise which would have increased the penalty for injuring a pregnant woman, but without conferring personhood on a fetus,&quot; Gandy said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill will next move to a more evenly-divided Senate, where the vote is expected to be close. If the UVVA passes the Senate, it will surely be signed by President George W. Bush, who has proven in his first 100 days an active leader in the restriction of reproductive rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Women's rights supporters in the Senate must defeat this legislation,&quot; urged Gandy. &quot;If lawmakers really want to protect women from abuse and violence, they should increase support for the domestic violence prevention programs created by the Violence Against Women Act, and not focus on limiting women's rights.&quot; <br>

  <br>

This is the first major battle in the Emergency Campaign for Women's Lives, which NOW kicked-off last Sunday with a rally at the Capitol attended by over 25,000 supporters. Gandy expects many more attacks on abortion and birth control in the next four years, and says that NOW will be there to fight back. </font></p>
