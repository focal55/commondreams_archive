- March 1 - <a href="http://www.StopTheWar.com">S</a><a href="http://www.StopTheWar.com/home.html" target="_blank">topTheWar.com</a>, 

              a website sponsored by The Lindesmith Center - Drug Policy Foundation 

              (Lindesmith-DPF), the nation’s leading organization working to end 

              the war on drugs, is urging President Bush to appoint a drug czar 

              who will “think outside the box,” as Michael Douglas’ character 

              pleads for in the movie Traffic.

<p>The drug czar is the director of the White House Office of National 

              Drug Control Policy, which oversees all federal anti-drug efforts. 

            </p>

            <p>In Traffic, the drug czar (played by Michael Douglas) is a tough-on-crime 

              judge who learns the futility of the war on drugs. The Bush Administration 

              is about to appoint a new drug czar - and <a href="http://www.StopTheWar.com/home.html" target="_blank">www.StopTheWar.com</a> 

              encourages its visitors to help influence the President’s choice. 

            </p>

            <p>“Our nation's drug policy is doomed so long as no one in power 

              is willing and able to admit the drug war’s failure and look for 

              real alternatives,” said Ethan Nadelmann, Executive Director of 

              Lindesmith-DPF. “What we need today is a drug czar who will talk 

              honestly and openly about the totality of drug use in America, and 

              who will address the negative consequences of our current policies.” 

            </p>

            <p>Drug policy reformers point out that illegal drugs are cheaper, 

              purer and more available than ever -- while taxpayers have spent 

              tens of billions of dollars, nearly half a million Americans are 

              behind bars on drug charges, and 200,000 cases of HIV have been 

              generated by injection drug use when implementation of public health 

              measures like needle exchange could have averted much of the tragedy. 

            </p>

            <p>StopTheWar.com was released on February 13 to highlight the links 

              between the hit movie Traffic and the real-life war on drugs. Traffic 

              was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, 

              and Best Screenplay (adapted). </p>

            <p>Visitors to the website can try to “win” the war on drugs by picking 

              from several of our government’s current strategies: locking up 

              all drug users and dealers; sending guns and money to Mexico and 

              Colombia to cut off the drug supply; and promoting “Just Say No” 

              campaigns in schools. Each strategy fails. </p>

            <p>Players will also be eligible to win a free Traffic DVD or video. 

              In addition the site includes ways to get more information on drug 

              education, marijuana regulation, needle exchange and other issues 

              related to our current drug policy. </p>

            <p>“It doesn't make that much difference if the new drug czar is a 

              doctor or a police chief or a former politician -- so as long as 

              he or she has the intelligence and courage to ask the tough questions 

              and challenge the fears, ignorance and prejudices that drive our 

              current approaches,” said Nadelmann.
