- July 11 - The Brennan Center for Justice joins Common Cause, The League of Women Voters and other reform groups in calling on the House of Representatives to reject any amendment to the Shays-Meehan bill which would take away the right of legal permanent residents to contribute to federal candidates.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Make no mistake about it. An amendment that would take away the rights of legal permanent residents to contribute to federal campaigns is nothing but a cynical effort to kill the support of Hispanic Members of Congress,&#148; said Nancy Northup, Director of the Brennan Center&#146;s Democracy Program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Now we hear that the same reform opponents who claim to have zero tolerance for any First Amendment infringement want to trample on the First Amendment rights of legal U.S. residents who work, pay taxes, and are subject to the military draft.&#148; said Ms. Northup. &#147;Such an amendment is wholly unnecessary, and it will reduce political participation. The courts will likely strike it down as unconstitutional.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similar amendments have been offered in past years&#146; debates on the Shays-Meehan bill. The amendments revised current law which permits legal permanent residents of the United States to make campaign contributions so that only citizens and U.S. nationals would have that right in federal elections. These amendments were portrayed as efforts to prevent foreign individuals from making such contributions, but they really affected only legal permanent residents. Contributions from foreign nationals are already illegal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Federal Election Campaign Act (&quot;FECA&quot;) already protects against foreign influence on American elections. It is illegal under FECA for foreign nationals to make contributions in connection with the selection of candidates for political office. The prohibition applies to foreign governments; foreign political parties; corporations, partnerships, associations, or other groups organized under the laws of another country or maintaining their principal place of business there; and individuals living abroad who are not United States citizens. The contributions are illegal whether they are made directly, through another person, or in another person's name. And it is illegal for a candidate to accept such contributions. There is no need for such an amendment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, such an amendment would be not merely redundant; but also grossly unfair and constitutionally questionable. It is unfair to the millions of legal permanent residents who make valuable contributions to their communities and to this country. Legal permanent residents are required to pay taxes just as U.S. citizens do. Legal permanent residents are also subject to the military draft, and thousands of them are veterans or active members of our armed forces. Some of them can even vote in certain local elections. Many of them are simply waiting until they can fulfill the requirements for full citizenship, and all of them have a personal stake in the governance of the country they have made their home.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And House Members should know better than to treat legal permanent residents of this country as corrupt &quot;foreigners&quot; who present a threat to the integrity of our elections. Indeed, invoking campaign finance abuses by a few people (including some U.S. citizens) who happen to have ethnically identifiable names to justify action against millions of legal permanent residents smacks of stereotyping and scapegoating of the very worst kind. Citizens who cynically seek to exploit loopholes in the campaign finance system are the real threat to our government, not legal permanent residents drawn here by the promise of American freedom and democracy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, it is telling that opponents of campaign finance reform, who piously invoke freedom of speech and association when defending soft money, have so little respect for the First Amendment when the rights of legal permanent residents are at stake. The expressive power of a political contribution, although symbolic and indirect, does not depend upon the contributor's status as a citizen or a legal permanent resident. In fact, campaign contributions may represent an even more important avenue of political expression and association for legal permanent residents than for citizens, because such residents generally cannot vote or hold public office. Members of Congress who care about the First Amendment including even those who oppose campaign finance reform on alleged First Amendment grounds should therefore resist any effort to ban contributions from legal permanent residents.</font></p>
