- May 17 - The Violence Policy Center 

(VPC) and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) have released 

&quot;Poisonous Pastime: The Health Risks of Shooting Ranges and Lead 

to Children, Families, and the Environment&quot;. The 71-page study 

documents how shooting ranges are poisoning children and polluting 

the environment with lead, yet remain almost entirely 

unregulated-exempt from even the Bush Administration's new lead 

pollution reporting rules. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Poisonous Pastime&quot; details how outdoor firing ranges put more 

lead into the environment than nearly any other major industrial 

sector in the U.S., yet they remain almost entirely unregulated. 

In just two years a typical outdoor firing range can have lead 

contamination equivalent to a five-acre Superfund site. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Poisonous Pastime&quot; documents how parents often put their own 

children at risk because they do not know that their visits to the 

local shooting range can result in lead poisoning of their children 

at home. Lead poisoning is known to cause terribly debilitating 

and sometimes fatal effects on children and adults. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is no question that the toxic levels of lead at shooting 

ranges are endangering America's children and families,&quot; states VPC 

Senior Policy Analyst and report author Tom Diaz. &quot;No amount of 

lead exposure is known to be completely safe for a child. 

&quot;Poisonous Pastime&quot; reveals for the first time that the gun 

industry-through toxic and unregulated ranges-is sacrificing the 

health of our children for profit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EWG says that every shooting range is a potential superfund 

site. Yet the NRA and the gun industry ignore these terrifying 

facts as they embrace shooting ranges as a way to reach out to 

women and children as their new markets. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the gun lobby has not adequately addressed the danger of 

lead at ranges and instead of real action has only offered 

pamphlets to range owners to counter this deadly toxin, Rick 

Stapleton of the EPA has stated &quot;Every bullet that's shot ends up 

someplace and adds lead to the environment.&quot; President Bush 

acknowledges the dangers of lead, but has implemented no regulatory 

actions to keep children safe from the toxic levels of lead at 

ranges. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Kansas City area alone, www.wheretoshoot.org lists over 30 

shooting ranges. It is unclear how many are still in operation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study reveals how school administrators throughout the 

country were oblivious to the dangers of lead-from school shooting 

ranges-until students were found to have elevated blood levels. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Every one of the 1,800 firing ranges in the U.S. represents a 

piece of land so highly contaminated with lead that it would 

require a massive clean-up effort to be safe for wildlife or any 

industrial or residential use,&quot; states EWG Research Director Jane 

Houlihan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Poisonous Pastime&quot; finds that the shooting range industry 

downplays the seriousness of problems with ranges, hides them from 

the general public, and allow thousands of unregulated shooting 

sites to continue to operate without strict oversight. It is based 

largely on the records of internal industry meetings and gun 

industry publications. The report includes recommendations at both 

local and federal levels.
