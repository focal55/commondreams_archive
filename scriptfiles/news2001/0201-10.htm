- February 1 - We are extremely disappointed that the 

          United States Senate would confirm John Ashcroft as Attorney General. 

          Because Mr. Ashcroft's views, public statements and conduct as a public 

          official place him so outside the mainstream of American values and 

          beliefs, we fear that this appointment will only deepen that which divides 

          us at the very moment that this nation needs healing.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mr. Ashcroft's past actions as an elected 

          official and his outspoken views on matters of great concern to our 

          nation&#151;especially civil rights and women's rights&#151;demonstrate 

          that he lacks the temperament, integrity, and commitment to basic worker 

          protections and to equal justice for all that Americans expect and are 

          entitled to from an Attorney General.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What Mr. Ashcroft brings to the position 

          is an ideological extremism and divisiveness that the nation doesn't 

          want&#151;and didn't vote for last fall. A majority of American voters 

          in last November's election said they support strong protections for 

          working families and for civil rights and women's rights. President 

          Bush's nomination of Mr. Ashcroft, and the Senate's confirmation, represents 

          just the opposite of what voters supported.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The deep division in the Senate and the 

          historic opposition generated by this nomination&#151;from millions 

          of working Americans and scores of organizations that champion rights 

          and equality for all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation 

          and other considerations&#151;underscore how troubling this nomination 

          is. Millions of Americans are deeply concerned about placing Mr. Ashcroft 

          at the Justice Department helm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Like all those who opposed this nomination, 

          we are gravely concerned about the message this selection sends about 

          President Bush's priorities and about future nominations to the federal 

          courts and to critical executive branch positions. We will not be silent 

          in the face of similarly inappropriate nominations, and the American 

          people will certainly not accept similarly extreme ideologues for these 

          important posts. </font></p>

<p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mr. Ashcroft has promised to enforce 

          the law fairly for all. The AFL-CIO and America's working families now 

          call on those Senators who voted in favor of John Ashcroft to hold him 

          accountable for keeping that promise&#151;for the nation and all our 

          citizens, especially those most dependent on our system of justice to 

          protect their rights and interests.</font><font face="Times New Roman">
