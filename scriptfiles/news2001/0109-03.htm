- January 9 - The nominees for Attorney

General, John Ashcroft, and for Secretary of Labor, Linda Chavez,

will roll back decades of legal advances and public policy gains

for women and their families if confirmed by the U.S. Senate, the

National Women's Law Center said today in officially opposing them.

<p>Since 1972, NWLC has been at the forefront of every major

battle to secure women's rights, including reproductive rights,

affirmative action, employment discrimination and sexual harassment

laws, and other civil rights and workplace fairness measures

-- some of the very laws that Ashcroft and Chavez stand to undermine

or even dismantle in their potential respective roles.

<p>NWLC Co-President Nancy Duff Campbell said, "Historically, the

Center has rarely taken positions on Executive Branch nominees and

this is the first time we have ever opposed a cabinet head. We

take this unusual step because these two nominees have been

selected for posts with significant responsibility for the

well-being of American women and they both have demonstrated

records of antagonism to the constitutional principles and federal

laws that have advanced and safeguarded women's progress for

more than three decades."

<p>"Senator Ashcroft's record demonstrates not only a lack of

commitment, but actual hostility to equal protection of the laws

and equal opportunity. Yet, a demonstrated commitment to these

fundamental principles is essential if the American public is to

have confidence in an Attorney General's fair and even-handed

enforcement of the law," said Marcia D. Greenberger, NWLC

Co-President.

<p>NWLC cited examples of Ashcroft's positions, including:

<p>-- Ashcroft is not only staunchly anti-choice in opposing

abortion, but he also opposes important forms of contraception. He

has voted in favor of overturning Roe vs. Wade and he is an

original sponsor of a proposed amendment to the Constitution, the

"Human Life Amendment," and a proposed federal statute, the

"Human Life Act," both of which would have prohibited all

abortions except those to protect the life of the mother and

defined abortion to include key forms of contraception. These

proposals contained no other exceptions, even when a woman has been

raped or is the victim of incest.

<p>-- Specifically, the sweeping language of Ashcroft's proposed

"Human Life Amendment" and "Human Life Act" defined human life as

beginning at "fertilization," and therefore could be invoked to ban

some commonly-used forms of the pill and the IUD, which sometimes

work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the lining

of the uterus.

<p>-- Ashcroft led the effort to defeat the confirmation to federal

district court of Judge Ronnie White, the first African-American on

the Missouri Supreme Court, even though Judge White was fully

qualified. In the process, Ashcroft grossly distorted Judge's

White's record. In addition, he has blocked and delayed other

qualified nominees to the federal bench, including many qualified

women.

<p>-- Ashcroft opposes affirmative action and has done a number of

things indicating a serious insensitivity on racial issues, such as

accepting an honorary degree from Bob Jones University, which is

infamous for its racially discriminatory policies.

<p>"The Attorney General is charged with enforcing the

constitutional protections and laws that have been essential to

women's opportunity and self-determination for thirty years.

The American public cannot have confidence that Senator Ashcroft

would enforce these protections with the same vigor and

determination he has displayed in opposing them," said Greenberger.

&nbsp;

<p>Greenberger added, "Linda Chavez is another cabinet nominee who

opposes the very laws and programs she will be overseeing. Her

long and outspoken opposition to laws promoting fairness in the

workplace -- employment discrimination and sexual harassment

laws, affirmative action, equal pay, family and medical leave and

numerous other measures -- make her wholly unsuitable for this

position."

<p>For example, the Department of Labor administers critical

anti-discrimination programs, most notably the federal contract

compliance program subject to Executive Order 11246, which

prohibits discrimination by all private companies receiving federal

contracts (including all forms of sex discrimination in employment,

such as compensation discrimination and sexual harassment) and

requires federal contractors over a certain size to implement

affirmative action programs (with flexible goals and timetables) to

ensure equal job opportunities for women and minorities.

<p>-- Chavez opposes affirmative action in employment, education,

and contracting, and she specifically opposes the goals and

timetables component to the Executive Order program that is

critical to its effectiveness. She has written that President

Reagan's failure to eliminate the goals and timetables component of

the Executive Order program was a "tremendous defeat" for those

like her in that Administration. She has further testified

(incorrectly) that the goals and timetables provisions are the same

as quotas.

<p>-- Chavez has ridiculed as "cockamamie" the observance of Equal

Pay Day, which is the day each year that the average woman's pay

catches up to what the average man earned at the end of the

previous year, and is used by women's organizations and public

officials to symbolize and highlight the continued problem of pay

discrimination based on sex. She has also disputed the notion of

a glass ceiling for women in the workplace.

<p>The Department of Labor also implements and enforces the Family

and Medical Leave Act, and implements basic worker protections

guaranteeing a minimum wage, overtime pay, worker safety and other

measures.

<p>-- Chavez opposed enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act

and supported President Bush's veto of it and opposes increases in

the minimum wage. She supports legislation (introduced by Senator

Ashcroft) that would seriously weaken current law on the 40-hour

work week and overtime pay.

<p>In addition, just last year the Labor Department issued

long-awaited regulations under Title IX of the Education Amendments

of 1972, implementing Title IX's nondiscrimination requirements in

education and training programs funded by the Department of Labor.

<p>-- Chavez filed comments opposing the implementation of the

Department of Labor's Title IX regulations on the erroneous ground

that they would broaden the purpose and scope of Title IX.

<p>Finally, numerous additional public statements further

demonstrate Chavez's outspoken hostility to the federal laws she

would oversee at the Department of Labor. For example:

<p>-- Chavez has said sexual harassment suits have made this a

"nation of crybabies," and complained that "ever since the courts

started interpreting a 'hostile work environment' to constitute

sexual harassment, bad taste has become a federal offense....Men

(are) often the targets of...witch hunts." She has ridiculed the

proposition that -- as the Supreme Court has now endorsed in a case

where NWLC was counsel -- schools may be held liable for sexual

harassment by one student of another.

<p>-- Chavez opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which reversed

a series of Supreme Court decisions in the late 1980s that made it

harder for plaintiffs to prevail in employment discrimination

cases, and which also added compensatory and punitive damages as

remedies for Title VII civil rights violations. Moreover, she

lauded President Bush's 1990 veto of the bill and complained that

the version he signed was still objectionable.

<p>"The Center takes the unusual step of formally opposing the

nominations of Senator Ashcroft and Ms. Chavez because, if

confirmed, they would pose a serious threat to women and their

families," said Campbell.
