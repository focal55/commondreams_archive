- May 23 - <P><LI>ROBERT McINTYRE, <A HREF="mailto:bmcintyre@ctj.org">

bmcintyre@ctj.org</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ctj.org/html/senmark.htm">www.ctj.org/html/senmark.htm</A><BR>

McIntyre is director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which has the only computer model outside the government capable of a detailed analysis of the effects of the proposed tax

cuts. CTJ has a series of reports on its website, including the newly released

"Distributional Effects of the Senate Finance Committee-Passed Version of

the Bush Tax Plan." Among its findings: While the top 1 percent of

Americans -- those making $373,000 or more -- will get a tax cut averaging

$44,293, the bottom 60 percent -- those making less than $44,000 -- will get an

average of a $330 cut.

<P><LI>JOHN MILLER, <A HREF="mailto:jmiller@wheatonma.edu">

jmiller@wheatonma.edu</A>, <A HREF="http://www.dollarsandsense.org">www.dollarsandsense.org</A><BR>

Professor of economics at Wheaton College in Massachusetts and a contributing editor at

<I>Dollars & Sense</I> magazine, Miller said today: “The Senate Finance

Committee-approved $1.35 trillion tax cut currently being considered by the

full Senate remains a tax giveaway to the wealthy. Even that version of the

Bush tax cut -- which is slightly more equitable because it would cut the top

income tax bracket by less and would expand the number of working families

eligible for the child tax credit -- awards 35 percent of its benefits to the

richest 1 percent of taxpayers, all with incomes over $373,000 per year, giving

them an average tax cut of over $122 per day, while the bottom 60 percent of

taxpayers get just 19.9 percent of the tax cut, or an average tax cut of less

than $1 per day. Also, the Senate Finance Committee tax cut, when its costs are

properly accounted for, would still effectively drain the usable portion of the

projected surpluses in the Federal Budget for the next 10 years, foreclosing

the possibility of using those monies to address pressing social needs: from

providing prescription drug coverage to seniors, to insuring many of those who

currently go without health insurance and lifting children out of poverty. For

instance, the $580 billion of this tax cut that will go to the richest 1

percent alone would pay for three-quarters of the cost of providing universal

prescription drug coverage for seniors…. By cutting income tax rates and

repealing the estate tax, the only progressive taxes in our tax code, the

Senate tax cut proposal will accomplish the other major goal of the Bush

administration: to saddle us with a more regressive tax code that will place a

larger portion of the burden of financing government on families who work for

wages."

Communications director of United for a Fair Economy and co-author of <I>Shifting Fortunes:

The Perils of the Growing American Wealth Gap</I>, Leondar-Wright said:

"How rapidly candidate Bush's slogan 'Leave no child behind' morphed into

President Bush's efforts to leave no millionaire behind! Given the many cuts in

children's programs and the tax cuts skewed towards the very rich, the Bush

budget entails a redistribution of wealth from children to the wealthiest

heirs. Children with multimillionaire parents may enjoy a tax-free inheritance,

but the other 98 percent of children will be out of luck."
