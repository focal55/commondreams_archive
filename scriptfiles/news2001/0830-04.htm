- August 30 - Global justice activists today denounced

an expected new World Bank "Information Disclosure

Policy." The disclosure policy, which is itself still

secret, is a sham attempt to address the demand of

critics that World Bank decision-making be open to the

scrutiny of the public and the news media.



<p>The disclosure policy is expected to be approved by

the World Bank Board of Directors on Thursday - in a

meeting that will be closed to the public and to the

news media. The policy specifies what the public is

allowed to know and is not allowed to know about the

operations of the World Bank.



<p>According to World Bank documents leaked to

non-governmental organizations, under the "new"

policy, meetings of the Board of Directors will

continue to be closed to the public and the news

media. Neither transcripts nor minutes of the meetings

will be released. Documents on investments in projects

such as dams, roads, oil and mining will only be

released after project approval, thus blocking public

input.



<p>Robert Naiman, a member of the Mobilization for Global

Justice, said today, "The World Bank's expected

approval of this policy makes a mockery of its claims

to be open to considering the demands of critics. The

meeting where they will ratify the policy will be

secret. The document is secret. Everything is secret.

The World Bank seems to fear sunlight more than

Dracula."



<p>Global justice activists and members of the

Mobilization for Global Justice will hold an emergency

demonstration at the World Bank's headquarters at 1818

H St NW at 6 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 30.



<p>The Mobilization for Global Justice has demanded that

all IMF and World Bank meetings should be open to the

public and the news media and broadcast on C-SPAN. The

MGJ has also demanded that the institutions cancel

impoverished country debt, end policies that block

access to education, health care, clean drinking

water, and other human needs, and end support for

environmentally and socially destructive projects,

including oil, gas, mining, and dams.
