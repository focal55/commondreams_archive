- March 20 - While D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams

proceeds with the privatization of D.C. General

Hospital and dismantling of its services, the D.C.

Statehood Green Party continues to demand, along with

the Health Care Now Coalition, Service Employees

International Union (SEIU), and numerous other local

organizations, coalitions, unions, third parties, and

churches that D.C. General be maintained as a full

service public hospital.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of the D.C. Statehood Green Party have

attended and testified at public hearings,

neighborhood meetings, and protests and will continue

until the Mayor and the Financial Control Board scrap

the scheme to hand D.C. General over to Doctors

Community Healthcare Corporation (DCHC).  Statehood

Greens, including Arturo Griffiths, 2000 candidate for

City Council At-Large, have participated in Health

Care Now since its founding, and the party continues

to support this coalition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Tuesday, March 20, Statehood Greens will

participate in a protest rally in front of the

Brookings Institution, where Financial Control Board

Chair Alice Rivlin holds her day job.  The rally,

sponsored by Health Care Now, begins at 5:30 p.m.; the

location is 1775 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.  (Contact

for this event: Vanessa Dixon, 202-483-3141.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The D.C. Statehood Green Party insists that the

funding to maintain full services at D.C. General is

well within reach.  &quot;The District can provide adequate

revenues to restore and expand our gutted safety net

especially the preservation and improvement of the

services of DC General Hospital and simultaneously

allow tax relief for low income and working class

families by restructuring our local tax structure to

make it fair and progressive....  The District does

have a tax base to fund essential needs!&quot; (Testimony

in support of raising the D.C. EITC to 25% of the

federal credit, David Schwartzman, D.C. Statehood

Green Party Finance and Revenue Committee, February 8,

2001, posted at &lt;<a href="http://www.dcstatehoodgreen.org/">http://www.dcstatehoodgreen.org/</a>&gt;)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Fair Taxes for D.C.&quot; plan, to which Mr.

Furious D.C. residents</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with thousands of other D.C. residents,

Statehood Greens have grown impatient and angry at

Mayor Anthony Williams' duplicity and obfuscation in

pushing the privatization plan, which was ordered by

the DC Financial Control Board, an unelected body

imposed by Congress and the White House.  Many D.C.

residents are especially angry at the Mayor's vague,

evasive, and dismissive responses to their concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Privatization will end inpatient care at D.C. General,

and farm the hospital's clientele -- mostly poor and

low-income working people, for whom the emergency room

serves as a doctor's office -- out to clinics and

private hospitals throughout D.C., many of which are

ill-prepared to receive them.  Neither the Mayor nor

D.C. Health Department Director Dr. Ivan Walks has

offered a specific plan to ensure that primary care

services will be in place.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1,250 jobs will be lost because of privatization.  On

Tuesday, March 6, D.C. City Council members voted 13-0

against it, but Council has no power to block the

deal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 

Another land grab</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Washington Post, which generally supports the

privatization plan, has begun to question the Mayor

and the specifics of his plan (&quot;Before D.C. General Is

Closed&quot; [editorial], March 17, 2001), even suspecting

a &quot;prime real estate&quot; land grab as motivation for the

closure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">D.C. Statehood Greens have long recognized that major

policies of the D.C.'s ruling Democrats have been

based on the demands of powerful real estate

interests: the new convention center and incipient

displacement of the surrounding neighborhood, closure

of public school buildings, the Mayor's attempt to

move the University of the District of Columbia,

construction of a Massachusetts Avenue ballpark, and

the impending D.C.-Baltimore bid for the 2012 Olympics

and conseqent plans for sports facilities built on

taxpayers' money.</font></p>

Revelations and responses</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** &quot;Few details have been made available [by the

month in response to the control board's request for

its network of six community health clinics and the

*** The DCHC proposal, which Mayor Williams has

refused to make public, contains only vague promises

depended on DC General, will be served.

*** DC Council Member David Catania has compiled

documentation proving (1) DCHC, a for-profit company,

is deeply in debt and unprofitable; and (2) DCHC has a

reputation for inability to complete deals and for

11th hour demands in negotiations.  Furthermore, it's

illegal for the DC to do business with a corporation

that owes back taxes to the city; DCHC has owed the

city back taxes since it bought Greater Southwest

Community Hospital.

*** Mayor Williams never released the December 2000

report from the Health Care System Development

Commission, which the Mayor chaired last year.  The

Mayor claims the report recommended eliminating DC

General and the Public Benefits Corporation, which

administers DC General.  DC Watch's Gary Imhoff says,

&quot;Mayor Williams, to put it kindly, must have been

misinformed. The report doesn't (that's 'does not')

recommend closing DC General, and it calls for

strengthening the PBC, not abolishing it.&quot;

*** &quot;D.C. General Hospital officials, several D.C.

council members and health care advocates are accusing

the mayor&#146;s administration and the financial control

board of misleading the public in order to drive their

agenda for dismantling the Public Benefit Corp.

(PBC)....  [T]hey point to the above-average 94

percent score that D.C. General just received from the

Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care

Organizations &#150; the accrediting agency for U.S.

hospitals &#150; as proof that recent horror stories about

questionable care being the norm at the facility are

untrue.&quot; -- &quot;D.C. General crisis called &#145;misleading&#146;:

*** Contrary to the Mayor's claims, &quot;D.C. hospitals do

not have a 75 percent occupancy rate....  [F]rom

October to March each year, the occupancy rate of

available general medical-surgical beds is 100 percent

on many days of the week.  The same is true for

intensive care unit beds in many of our hospitals.... 

Greater Southeast Hospital cannot possibly develop,

staff and become an accredited trauma center in three

months.  The accreditation process will take at least

a year....  In the meantime, where will major trauma

cases go?  Howard, Providence, Washington Hospital

Center, George Washington and Greater Southeast will

be swamped with absorbing the 13,000 ambulance

transports that went to D.C. General last year.  This

is in addition to the thousands of patients who will

walk into the already crowded emergency departments.&quot;

Hospital Emergency Department, in a letter to The

Washington Post, March 15, 2001</font></p>

*** Although the Mayor's office complained that the

Mayor was 'ambushed' by Rev. Willie Wilson's criticism

of the Mayor's plans at a public meeting at Union

Temple on March 1, the Mayor's Chief of Staff

Abdusalam Omer was told in advance that Rev. Wilson

opposed closing D.C. General and he would speak

against it in the meeting at his church (reported in

DC Watch&#146;s &quot;themail&quot; bulletin board).  In a meeting

shortly between the Mayor and local ministers shortly

after the Union Temple event, &quot; the ministers said the

mayor had insulted them by having uniformed officers

remain until the pastors insisted they leave.  'To

have to be surrounded by armed policemen -- it shows

the insensitivity,' said the Rev. Willie F. Wilson, of

Union Temple Baptist Church.  'It was despicable.'&quot;

7, 2001, The Washington Post</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

*** Ron Linton, former chair of the Public Benefits

Corporation: &quot;Yes, the hospital has run a deficit.

Yes, it could have been managed better. It should have

been replaced years ago with a modern facility. But

that has little to do with the current situation. DC

General receives from the city about $40 million a

year. It needs $75 to meet its budget. But instead of

giving DC General $35 million more, the city

apparently at the Control Board's direction, will give

Southeast (a profit making institution) $85 million to

do less than what is done now at DC General.&quot;

*** &quot;[T]he people and a majority of their elected D.C.

City Council have been trying to tell the mayor's

representatives at meeting after meeting across this

city that they want their tax dollars spent to

maintain D.C. General Hospital and its network of

health-care services as public entities....  

Municipal governments are not supposed to turn a

profit. A government that profits off the backs of

taxpayers, while telling the taxpayers that the

government cannot afford to provide the services that

the public wants, is not doing its job.  Providing

government services is supposed to cost money. That's

why taxes exist.&quot; -- &quot;Officials are out of touch&quot;

*** &quot;If things go according to plan, Washington DC

will gain a $50 million mayoral mansion and lose its

public hospital at about the same time.... First as

the city's financial officer after the federal

takeover of DC in the mid-90s, and then as mayor,

Williams has also overseen the deterioration of other

public health and social services, the public schools

and the public university. He has concentrated instead

on improvements that appeal to the approximately 20%

of residents who earn over $100,000 and pay about 50%

of the city's income taxes.&quot; -- &quot;Singapore on the
