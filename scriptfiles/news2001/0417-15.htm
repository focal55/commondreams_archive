- April 17 - Shareholders attending Citigroup&#146;s (Citi) shareholder meeting 

        this morning at Carnegie Hall were greeted by a lively protest with representatives 

        from diverse organizations demanding that Citi go beyond the bottom line 

        and clean up its act on environmental and social abuses worldwide. Student 

        representatives also announced to gathering shareholders that an international 

        Citi credit card boycott has been launched.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Calling Citigroup &#147;the world&#146;s most destructive bank,&#148; 

          students from

          national networks also announced their campus campaign to transfer student

          loan balances away from Citi and challenge university relationships 

          with the

          financial institution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Students customers are the backbone of the Citigroup machine!&#148; 

          declared

          Kelly Nagy from Student Environmental Action Coalition. &#147;We are 

          waking up to

          the company&#146;s environmental track record and policies and proclaiming, 

          &#147;Hey

          Citi, not with my money!&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A broad coalition of groups, including Rainforest Action Network, NY

          National Organization of Women, Inner City of the Move, and United for 

          A

          Fair Economy, held a press conference and protests outside of the

          shareholder meeting at Carnegie Hall this morning.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/0417-01.jpg" width="333" height="250" align="left" alt="Rainforest Action Network">Today&#146;s 

          event caps a week of protests against Citi&#146;s 

          policies in more than 80 cities in 12 countries and a banner 

          hang at the corporate headquarters yesterday in midtown Manhattan. 

          Growing ranks of students and shareholders are joining the campaign 

          to demand that Citi adopt comprehensive environmental and social criteria 

          throughout their lending and trading business.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Students are always on the forefront of every social change movement, 

          so

          its no surprise that students are leading the way towards transforming 

          the

          global financial system,&#148; said Patrick Reinsborough, Organizing 

          Director of

          the Rainforest Action Network. &#147;Students today understand the connection

          between Citi&#146;s leading role in rainforest destruction in South 

          America,

          predatory lending in communities of color in the South Bronx, and sexual

          harassment in the workplace. They simply will not tolerate their money 

          being

          put toward this systemic abuse.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citi shareholders were also greeted by the upbeat Red Dancing Umbrella

          Troupe-co-opting Citi&#146;s corporate logo-with campaign messages, 

          while

          concerned Citi customers handed out custom-made fortune cookies decrying

          Citi&#146;s environmental and social negligence.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representatives from Rainforest Action Network on site today pointed 

          to

          several examples of the company&#146;s involvement in egregious projects,

          including mining in the fragile Amazon basin and expanding palm plantations

          in critical habitat of endangered orangutans in Indonesia. Protesters 

          also

          highlighted Citi&#146;s policies of redlining communities and &#145;predatory 

          lending&#146;

          in urban areas that disproportionately affect low-income people and 

          target

          communities of color.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international campaign targeting Citigroup is working to transform 

          the

          funding practices of the corporate financial system. Rainforest Action

          Network calls for an immediate ban on funding development projects that

          result in the destruction of primary forests worldwide and a prioritization

          of lending for renewable energies and tree-free lumber and paper

          alternatives. </font></p>
