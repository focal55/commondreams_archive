- October 17 - The Brady Center to 

Prevent Gun Violence today reacted to the Fifth Circuit Court's 

decision in Emerson v. United States. Although the court 

reinstated the charges against Timothy Joe Emerson for illegal 

possession of a firearm, it also found that the Constitution 

guarantees the right of an individual to bear arms for purposes 

unrelated to militia service. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Fifth Circuit's ruling in Emerson v. United States achieves 

the right result for the wrong reasons,&quot; said Dennis Henigan, 

director of the Brady Center's Legal Action Project. &quot;We are 

pleased that the court rejected the National Rifle Association's 

extremist view that would have guaranteed Timothy Joe Emerson his 

right to own an arsenal even though he was the subject of a 

domestic violence restraining order and had threatened his wife 

with a handgun. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But the Court's suggestion that the Second Amendment guarantees 

an individual right to be armed for reasons unrelated to organized 

militia service is based on a gross distortion of American 

constitutional history and the prior rulings of the United States 

Supreme Court. It is obvious that two judges of the Fifth Circuit 

sought to use this case to propound their theory of the Second 

Amendment, but it is a theory that has been soundly rejected by 

every other federal appeals court.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Emerson opinion itself acknowledged, Federal courts have 

long held that the Second Amendment does not guarantee an 

individual's right to bear arms absent a state-sponsored militia. 

Just this year, the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Eighth and 

Tenth Circuits reaffirmed the long-accepted principle that there is 

no individual right to be armed for personal purposes. For example, 

in an Oklahoma case (a) handed down in August, the Tenth Circuit 

unanimously held that &quot;a federal criminal gun-control law does not 

violate the Second Amendment unless it impairs the state's ability 

to maintain a well regulated militia.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Clearly, the Fifth Circuit's ruling is an aberration,&quot; 

continued Henigan. &quot;And we believe that the collective rights 

interpretation of the Second Amendment will continue to be the 

prevailing view of courts in every region outside the Fifth 

Circuit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The NRA had filed a brief in the Emerson case urging the court 

to throw out Emerson's indictment. Today, James Baker of the NRA 

promised to use the Emerson opinion to attack other reasonable gun 

safety laws. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Brady Center's Legal Action project filed an amicus brief in 

Emerson v. United States, joined by eleven national law enforcement 

organizations, opposing the individual rights theory. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background: 

Timothy Joe Emerson was subject to a domestic violence 

restraining order that required him not to come near his estranged 

wife or her young daughter, and was therefore prohibited by federal 

law, 18 U.S.C. section 922(g)(8), from possessing a firearm. He was 

indicted for violating that provision after an incident in which he 

threatened his wife with a Beretta pistol and pointed it at her 

child. Incredibly, Judge Samuel Cummings of the U.S. District Court 

for the Northern District of Texas dismissed the indictment and 

ruled that the federal law denying guns to those under restraining 

orders is an unconstitutional infringement of the Second Amendment. </font></p>
