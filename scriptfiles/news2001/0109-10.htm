- January 9 - The following is a

statement by Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (CRLP)

President Janet Benshoof:

<p>"Nominating John Ashcroft for Attorney General is like letting

the fox guard the chicken house. It demonstrates the deceptive

tactics of President-Elect Bush, who buried his anti-choice beliefs

during the campaign to appear moderate to the pro-choice majority

of Americans.

<p>"Speaking as an American citizen, an advocate for women's human

rights, and an attorney, I believe that John Ashcroft's disregard

for the rule of law and his extreme anti-woman ideology makes him

an unfit candidate to lead the Department of Justice. It is

inappropriate for the nation's top law officer to be opposed to the

rights of half the nation's population, yet Ashcroft's hostility to

women's reproductive rights is fierce.

<p>"Ashcroft's activist approach to undermining constitutional

principles should disqualify him from holding the office of

Attorney General. Throughout his career, Ashcroft has been a

leading proponent of measures that would eliminate altogether the

right of women to make decisions about their reproductive health.

He is on record in the U.S. Senate as opposing the United States

Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. He is a major architect

of the legal assaults on Roe, which has been weakened by challenges

from Missouri during Ashcroft's tenure both as state Attorney

General and Governor. He vigorously objects to all abortions, even

for women who have been raped or are the victims of incest. He

does not believe women should have access to the safest methods of

abortion to protect their health, and remains a leading proponent

of abortion bans that have been found unconstitutional by the

Supreme Court. He even opposes some of the most effective methods

of birth control.

<p>"As Attorney General, Ashcroft would impose an anti-choice

litmus test for appointments to the federal bench, including the

U.S. Supreme Court. A hero to extreme, fringe organizations

opposed to abortion, Ashcroft is unlikely to allocate Justice

Department resources to defend the Freedom of Access to Clinic

Entrances Act (FACE), a federal law to prosecute those who attack

and threaten reproductive health clinics. Without vigorous

enforcement of this federal law, and a zero tolerance approach to

domestic terrorism at clinics, CRLP fears that our clients,

abortion providers and their patients, will again be subjected to

unacceptable and potentially lethal consequences for performing a

safe and legal medical procedure.

<p>"The rule of law does not temper his extreme ideological

opposition to women's reproductive autonomy, rendering John

Ashcroft unfit to hold the keys to the Department of Justice. CRLP

urges the Senate to reject his nomination."

<p><i>The Center for Reproductive Law &amp; Policy works domestically and

internationally to promote women's reproductive health and rights

through litigation, research, policy analysis and public education.
