- January 5 - The Federation of American

Scientists strongly endorses the Findings and Recommendations

Concerning the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty just

presented to the President by General John M. Shalikashvili (USA,

Ret.). The treaty plays a key role in containing the spread of

nuclear weapons, reducing the risk that other nations will develop

the sophisticated weapons designs needed for easy delivery by

mobile or multiple warhead missiles, and preventing a new arms

race in "third generation" nuclear designs that could only weaken

US security. While the treaty by itself provides no guarantee that

the proliferation of nuclear weapons will stop, U.S. failure to

ratify threatens to unravel the network of international controls

that offer the best hope for controlling the spread of nuclear

weapons and the risk that they might be used.

<p>The work of FAS scientists strongly supports the report's

conclusion that the treaty could be adequately verified and that

the security and reliability of U.S. weapons can be assured in the

absence of nuclear tests. While the treaty is not without risks, we

strongly support General Shalikashvili's bottom line: "After

examining these issues, I remain convinced that the advantages of

the Test Ban Treaty outweigh any disadvantages, and thus that

ratification would increase national security."

<p>"The report has done a great service by providing a thoughtful

and thorough review of issues raised by members of the Senate who

had doubts about the treaty and provide the basis for rapid Senate

action on ratification of the Test Ban Treaty." said Henry Kelly,

FAS President, "The report's recommendations for further

strengthening of U.S. verification and stewardship programs should

receive strong bipartisan support. U.S. security is clearly

strengthened if nuclear weapons play a reduced role in the world.

President-elect Bush and members of the Senate must give this

report serious attention".
