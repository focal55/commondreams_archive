- April 6 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;When Business Week releases their list of the ten companies with 

          the highest paid CEOs for 2000, that would be a good list of stocks 

          to sell short.&quot;</i></font>

<p align="right"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> --- Scott 

          Klinger, report author</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A new study reveals 

        that high-priced executive compensation plans reward past performance 

        more than sustained business success. While top-paid CEOs are expected 

        to guide their corporations to superior performance relative to industry 

        peers, their performance has been mediocre at best, according to the report 

        released today by United for a Fair Economy, &quot;The Bigger They Come, 

        The Harder They Fall.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;CEOs justify 

        their pay packages by saying they generate tremendous wealth for shareholders. 

        But it&#146;s a myth that CEOs are paid for excellence. Typically, their 

        companies don&#146;t deliver excellence,&quot; says Scott Klinger, report 

        author and co-director of the Responsible Wealth project at United for 

        a Fair Economy. &quot;Companies with more limited wage gaps are actually 

        better bets for shareholders.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report examines 

        the stock price performance of the companies headed bythe ten most highly 

        compensated CEOs for each of the seven years between 1993 and 1999. The 

        stock performance of each company was compared to both the S&amp;P500 

        and the company&#146;s peer group over one-year and three-year time periods. 

        In six out of the seven one-year time periods following a CEO&#146;s appearance 

        on the top ten list, at least half the companies under-performed the S&amp;P500. 

        In 40% of the cases, the companies trailed the S&amp;P500 by more than 

        15 percentage points.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stock performance 

        of the companies with the CEOs rated number one in each year is even more 

        dismal. If someone had invested $10,000 in the company with the highest 

        paid CEO on December 31, 1993, held it for a year, then sold it to buy 

        stock in the next year&#146;s pay leader and so on, by the end of 1999, 

        the $10,000 investment would have eroded to $3,585. A $10,000 investment 

        in the S&amp;P500 over the same period would have grown to $32,301, more 

        than nine times the pay leaders&#146; portfolio.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Business Week releases their list of the ten companies with 

        the highest paid CEOs for 2000, that would be a good list of stocks to 

        sell short,&quot; says Klinger.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The companies examined 

        in the study performed even worse when compared to their industry peers. 

        In each of the five three-year periods examined, between 50% and 71% of 

        the companies trailed their industry peers. One example is Disney, whose 

        CEO, Michael Eisner, was one of the ten highest paid CEOs of the 1990s. 

        Between January 1, 1993, and February 28, 2001, Disney stock returned 

        just 128.3%. By comparison, the S&amp;P Entertainment</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Index saw a return 

        of 163.3% and the S&amp;P500 saw a 204.2%. Other major companies covered 

        in the report are Intel, Citigroup, Lucent, Cisco Systems, Tyco International, 

        HJ Heinz, General Electric, Sears, Goodyear, Coca-Cola, Greentree Financial, 

        Cendant, Conseco, Health South, IBM, Computer Associates, and Andrew Corporation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other findings, 

        &quot;The Bigger They Come&quot; indicates that it is not shareholders 

        alone who should worry about escalating pay packages for executives. In 

        each of the years between 1994 and 1999, at least 50% of the companies 

        announced significant layoffs within three years of the CEO appearing 

        on the Business Week top ten list.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responsible Wealth 

        has filed shareholder resolutions related to executive compensation at 

        seven companies. The companies are Disney, Fleet, Citigroup, Raytheon, 

        Household International, Exxon Mobil, and AT&amp;T. The resolutions urge 

        companies to link CEO pay to improved performance in customer satisfaction, 

        employee satisfaction, or performance on social issues such as predatory 

        lending. The text of each resolution can be found on theResponsible Wealth website, <a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org">www.responsiblewealth.org</a>.</font></p>
