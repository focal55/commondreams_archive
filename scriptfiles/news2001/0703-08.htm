- July 3 - Exactly 225 years after the United States was 

founded, 

many Americans are giving the country a failing grade when it comes to 

guarding the 

Constitutional rights the country was created to protect, according to a 

survey released for the Fourth of July holiday today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most endangered right? The right to run for elected office, which only 

41% of 

Americans feel is open equally to rich and poor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also receiving a flunking grade is the right of equal access to the federal 

courts, which only 45% of Americans surveyed feel is open to rich and poor 

equally. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistics are part of the Second Annual Fourth of July Survey 

commissioned by New York public relations consultant Jeff Barge. The 

telephone survey of 1,000 households was conducted with the assistance of 

Opinion Research Corp. of Princeton, N.J. and has a margin of error of 3%.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For the second year in a row, Americans have given two of the nation's 

Constitutional rights a failing grade,&quot; said Mr. Barge. &quot;This should be a 

cause of some concern.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the news is not all gloomy. According to survey, the country has been 

more 

successful  in guaranteeing other Constitutional rights. Scoring highest is 

freedom of 

religion, which 91% feel is guaranteed equally to rich and poor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And despite the Florida voting fiasco last fall, 85% of Americans feel that 

the right to 

vote is equally available to rich and poor &#150; despite a controversial study by 

the U.S. 

Commission on Civil Rights saying that black voters in Florida were 10 times 

more  

likely to have their ballots rejected than white voters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, 69% of those surveyed feel that gun ownership is equally 

available to rich and poor; and 63% of Americans feel that the right to free 

speech is equally available to rich and poor. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other surprising results of the Second Annual Fourth of July Survey:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--74% of Americans say that it is important for Congress to pass some form of 

campaign finance reform in order to protect democracy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--68% of Americans say that any kid in the country should be allowed to join 

the Boy 

Scouts, whether he is straight or gay. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">--39% of Americans believe George Bush would not now be president if minority 

votes in Florida had been accurately counted in last November's presidential 

election

-- with 70% of black Americans feeling that way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the survey, Americans' confidence in equal justice is the only 

right that has shown an increase in confidence in the past year, tacking on a 

17-point increase from  last year's dismal showing that only 28% of Americans 

felt rich and poor had equal access to justice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year's confidence level may have been dragged down by the spring release 

of &quot;And Justice for Some,&quot; funded by several of the nation's leading 

foundations. That study says black youths convicted of drug offenses are 48 

times more likely to be sentenced to juvenile prison than white youths. 

Overall, black youths with no record are six times as likely as whites to be 

imprisoned. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If President Bush wants to win the black vote in his re-election campaign, 

he might consider taking steps to stop discrimination against blacks in 

America's courts,&quot; says Mr Barge.  &quot;The Democrats have left themselves wide 

open on this issue.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although that study did not list the names of  the individual judges 

responsible for the wide disparity in sentencing, in this year's survey 72% 

of those polled say their names should be made public by the Justice Dept. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Media reports that members of the Supreme Court discriminate against blacks 

and other minorities in making personal hiring decisions for judicial 

clerkships may also be contributing to a low score for the federal judicial 

system; 35% of those surveyed this year said that they were aware of media 

coverage of this Supreme Court discrimination.

 

A series of articles in USA Today and other newspapers have noted that only 

2% of Supreme Court clerks appointed by the present group of justices were 

black and only 1% Hispanic. Those articles singled out Chief Justice 

Rehnquist and Justices Souter, Scalia and Kennedy as four judges who have 

never hired a black clerk since being appointed to the Supreme Court. Chief 

Justice Rehnquist has been on the Supreme Court for 29 years, since being 

appointed by Nixon in 1972; Justice Scalia has been on the Court for 14 

years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the rise in overall confidence in equal justice, Americans were still 

skeptical 

about the fairness of the court system, with half of all Americans (50%) 

saying the courts are &quot;at least occasionally biased&quot; against the poor and 

minorities, and 37% saying they are &quot;often&quot; biased. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And overall, the nation was mixed as to whether Congress was doing a good job 

of protecting their Constitutional rights, with 78% saying Congress &quot;does a 

good job&quot; protecting freedom of religion; 71% saying it does a good job 

protecting voting rights; 62% saying it does a good job of protecting free 

speech; and 61% saying it does a good job of protecting access to guns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But only 52% say Congress does a good job of protecting equal access of rich 

and poor to the courts; and just 41% say Congress does a good job of 

protecting equal access of rich and poor to elected office.
