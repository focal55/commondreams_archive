- December 7 - The Alliance for Justice 

expresses deep concern over Attorney General John Ashcroft's 

allegation that those who criticize the Bush Administration's 

decision to use military tribunals to try non-U.S. citizens are 

&quot;aiding terrorists&quot; as well as eroding national unity. The U.S. 

Constitution, as the Attorney General certainly knows, defines 

treason as giving &quot;the Enemies...Aid and Comfort.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alliance For Justice President Nan Aron stated that, &quot;stifling 

legitimate debate through denunciation and questioning the Senate's 

constitutional oversight responsibility gravely erodes the public's 

confidence that the Attorney General respects the rule of law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Alliance is troubled with the Attorney General's refusal to 

support a request that provisions of the law be amended to close 

the gun show loophole or allow federal investigators to track sales 

of firearms to suspected terrorists. Yesterday's New York Times 

reported several specific instances of terrorists who used the &quot;gun 

show loophole&quot; -- which allows the untracked sale of guns at gun 

shows to people who are legally barred from buying firearms -- to 

illegally purchase guns. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While the Attorney General has asked Congress to grant the 

Administration greatly expanded powers in other areas of the law, 

he refuses either to make such requests or even to explain his 

refusal to do so when it comes to the sale of guns,&quot; added Aron. 

The same Al Qaeda manuals quoted by the Attorney General and others 

at the recent hearings included instructions that terrorists use 

the lack of background checks to buy guns for terrorist activities 

and for smuggling overseas. </font></p>
