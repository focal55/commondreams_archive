- October 15 - When George W. Bush assumed office in the wake of last year's

tumultuous presidential race, business interests spanning nearly

every industry in the nation thought tax breaks would be a sure

thing under the new Republican administration.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But when corporate lobbyists attempted to attach their various

wish lists to President Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut proposal

last spring, the White House shooed them away, promising that

another tax bill with its own opportunities would come later.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, business interests--the ones who not only paid most of

the $3 billion tab for last year's record-breaking elections,

but also shelled out millions more this year to lobby in support

of Bush's controversial tax cut--are still waiting. But they may

not be for much longer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the Sept. 11 attacks against the World Trade Center

and the Pentagon, the House this week is set to take up what

could be the most expensive bailout ever: an economic stimulus

plan that could cost as much as $100 billion. The legislation,

jointly conceived by President Bush and the Congress, includes a

series of targeted tax cuts for businesses and individuals aimed

at jump-starting the sluggish economy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Already, the bill has reinvigorated at least one industry:

Washington's special interest lobbyists, who view the stimulus

plan as an irresistible way to finally achieve some hard-fought

goals. And while some groups, including the Tax Relief Coalition

(a group assembled last spring by the National Association of

Manufacturers and other trade associations to support Bush's

individual tax cuts), have urged restraint among their members,

many are already bracing for a virtual feeding frenzy. The end

result could be an old package filled with long-debated

issues--only this time, it has a new wrapping: the American flag.</font></p>
