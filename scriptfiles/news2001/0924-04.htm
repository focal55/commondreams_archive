Professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Pollin wrote

"Economic Slide Makes Spending Respectable" in today's <I>Los Angeles

Times</I>. He said today: "U.S. economic policymakers have failed for almost a

year to respond adequately to the looming global recession. As the stock market

plunge makes clear, the calamitous events of September 11 certainly strengthen

the recessionary forces, and therefore the likelihood that unemployment,

poverty and social despair will spread. But the solution to the recession post

September 11 is now also obvious: large-scale injections of government spending,

even if the federal surplus evaporates. The perennial issue with government

spending is whether the funds will be used effectively. One standard

appropriate to the September 11 tragedy would seem clear: to use government

funds to protect innocent people everywhere from further terrorist attacks as

well as self-defeating cycles of violent reprisals."

Professor emeritus of economics at Bryn Mawr College and author of <I>Accumulation and Power: An Economic History of the United States</I>, Du Boff wrote in Friday's

<I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I>: "George W. Bush stated last fall, and repeats as

president, that when you look at taxes or the government surplus, 'It's not the

government's money. It's your money.' And yet the Bush administration plans a

multibillion-dollar bailout for our airlines, already in financial trouble even

before September 11. So it's not your money -- it's the airlines' money? America's

airlines do need help -- but if the national government can step in and help a

private industry and its shareholders at a moment's notice, why is it wrong, or

wasteful or a threat to 'freedom,' for government to provide increasing and

long-term support for our economic and social infrastructure?" Du Boff

said today: "U.S. military spending was already running at an annual rate

of about $350 billion -- which is 70 percent more than the next five combined

(Russia, Japan, the UK, France, China). More military spending is not going to

make us safer.... The grotesquely expensive 'missile defense system' is

worthless for our defense; even if successful, it would not protect us against

any real threats that terrorists pose. Right now, there is essentially only one

party in Congress; the Democrats have abandoned their role in debating, or even

analyzing, the administration's plans to escalate military spending."

Professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and the author of

<I>Neo-Liberalism or Democracy?</I>, MacEwan said today: "The

administration seems to be using this tragedy to continue its policy of

transferring wealth to corporations and ignoring the plight of working people.

For example, the Senate just restored $1.3 billion back to the so-called

'missile defense system' -- even though the events of September 11 have shown

it to be irrelevant to our security. Spending this much money for this project

is a huge boondoggle. The administration has moved very rapidly for a large

bailout of the airlines, yet we see no similar concern for the tens of

thousands of workers who were laid off by the airline industry. In the past,

war rhetoric has been used to suppress workers' demands for a fair share of the



economy and unfortunately we may see such a turn of events again. When

corporations were making super-profits, there were no initiatives or calls to

share the wealth with the working people, but as soon as things take a downturn

we hear calls for sharing the burden. Also, let us not forget that a recession

was already developing before September 11 so we may be bailing out

corporations whose troubles did not originate with the tragedy of September

11."
