- June 26 - As the Republican Party 

prepares to hold a major fundraiser that tobacco industry lobbyists 

are helping to organize, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the 

American Lung Association will run a newspaper ad Wednesday 

decrying what the tobacco industry has received so far for the $8.3 

million in federal campaign contributions it made in the last 

election. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids also repeated its call for 

President Bush and his party not to solicit or accept contributions 

from tobacco interests while the Administration is engaged in 

settlement negotiations with the tobacco industry over the federal 

tobacco lawsuit. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is a serious conflict of interest that President Bush and 

his party are continuing to solicit campaign contributions from the 

tobacco industry at the same time the Administration is negotiating 

with the tobacco companies,&quot; said Matthew L. Myers, President of 

the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. &quot;We call on the President to 

immediately order his party's fundraising committees to stop 

soliciting or accepting tobacco campaign contributions and to 

return any funds received for this week's fundraiser.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tobacco lobbyists are helping organize a fundraiser Wednesday 

night at the Washington Convention Center that is expected to raise 

more than $15 million for the Republican Congressional and 

Senatorial campaign committees. President Bush is the guest of 

honor. The Republican Party received 83 percent of the tobacco 

money contributed in the last election. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad being run by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and the 

American Lung Association is attached. The ad can also be viewed at 

<a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/campaign/printads" target="new">www.tobaccofreekids.org/campaign/printads</a>. Headlined &quot;Its payback 

time. Big Tobacco's political contributions are paying off,&quot; the ad 

lists the following benefits the tobacco industry has received from 

allies in the White House and Congress: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- &quot;A surrender on the Department of Justice tobacco lawsuit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- &quot;An FDA bill protecting the tobacco industry&quot; - introduced by 

U.S. Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA) and U.S. Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN), the 

chairs of the Republican Congressional and Senatorial campaign 

committees. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- &quot;A systematic undermining of international efforts to curb 

tobacco use,&quot; which include efforts to weaken the proposed 

international tobacco treaty (Framework Convention on Tobacco 

Control) and to pressure South Korea to back off on plans to impose 

a 40 percent tariff on imported tobacco. </font></p>
