- September 28 - WorldLink TV, the 24-hour television network with a global perspective on news, events and culture, is offering a variety of special programming in response to the recent terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Seen in more than 16 million homes that receive direct-to-home satellite television (DIRECTV and DISH Network), WorldLink TV’s programs offer insight and information about the attacks not often found on network television or cable news channels.  



 



<p>UNITED NATIONS SUMMIT ON TERRORISM

 



<p>On Monday, October 1, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to debate, in plenary session, Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism. WorldLink TV will provide gavel-to-gavel coverage of this historic event, which will allow UN member nations to address the threat of terrorism facing the world.  Live coverage will begin at 10:00 AM ET / 7:00 AM PT each day and highlights may be repeated in the evening. Each program will also be streamed live on the Internet at <a href="http://www.worldlinktv.com" target="_new">www.worldlinktv.com</a>. 



 



<p>DAILY UNITED NATIONS COVERAGE

 



<p>As the nation tries to make sense of this tragedy, many Americans are hungry for information about how our leaders plan to react to the attack. WorldLink TV is now providing daily live and taped coverage of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. Airing daily from 4:00 PM ET / 1:00 PM PT, WorldLink’s two-hour coverage of the UN is a valuable resource for those who wish to follow the international community’s response to the attacks and their plans for action against the perpetrators. WorldLink’s UN broadcasts are made possible by a grant from the Better World Fund.



 



<p>“AFGHAN PERSPECTIVES”

 



<p>What happens when the country you now pledge allegiance to wages war on the country of your birth? On October 1, at 10:00 PM ET / 7:00 PM PT, WorldLink will air “Afghan Perspectives,” a live call-in program with three Afghan-Americans — a historian, a journalist, and an Islamic scholar — who will discuss their views on the U.S. threats of war on the Taliban and post-attack attitudes towards Muslims in the United States. The program will also feature historical footage about previous wars in Afghanistan, and a report from Fremont, CA, which has the largest concentration of Afghans living in this country. Viewers may call in their questions and comments to 1-800-510-9480. 



 



<p>INTERNATIONAL VIEWPOINTS

 



<p>WorldLink carries frequent news reports from Deutsche Welle TV, the German equivalent of the BBC World Service. Currently, the 30-minute “DW Journal” is airing every two hours, live from Berlin (in English). These programs cover the international response to the terrorist attacks, and include excellent reporting from European sources not seen elsewhere on US television.
