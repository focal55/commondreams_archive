- July 12 - Jeanette Wallis, 30, is currently in Portland recovering from a sprained ankle incurred during her solo walk across the United States. She left Seattle on April 1st of this year carrying &quot;grievances&quot; - hand-written letters from concerned citizens who felt their votes and voices were discounted during the 2000 Presidential Election. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I wasn't an activist at all until I got tear-gassed walking home from the store during the WTO Ministerial in Seattle&quot;, said Ms. Wallis during her speech at the Inauguration Day protest in Seattle on January 20th of this year. &quot;Since then, I've gone to every protest, rally, and picket line I could find. I don't belong to any group or organization, but I strongly believe in our fundamental right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the Supreme Court stopped the counting of votes during the Presidential Election of 2000, Ms. Wallis decided to exercise that First Amendment guarantee on a grand scale. Since Inauguration Day, she has gathered grievances which run the gamut from outrage over the election to concern regarding the policies of the Bush administration. A sampling of these letters can be found on her web page, <a href="http://www.thewalkfordemocracy.org" target="new">www.thewalkfordemocracy.org</a>. Ms. Wallis has walked 650 miles of the estimated 4,500 mile trek to Washington D.C., where she plans to hand-deliver all of the grievances collected along the way to President Bush early next spring. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Wallis' minor injury occurred outside of Boise, Idaho. She traveled to Portland to recuperate with friends, and is using this time to speak to as many organizations as possible about her cause. Along with the hundreds of citizens she has spoken to over the past seven months, she has received support and endorsements from the United Steelworkers of America, VoterMarch, Democrats.com, the Pierce County Labor Council, the Umatilla-Morrow Central Labor Council, Hell's Canyon Preservation Council, Oregon Rural Action, and United Visions Idaho. Ms. Wallis will return to Boise early next week, where she will resume the next leg of her journey towards Salt Lake City, Utah.</font></p>
