- July 18 - This month, new physicians-usually called residents or

interns-will begin the most arduous period of their training, frequently

required to work 36-hour shifts and workweeks up to 100 hours, at hospitals

in every community across the country.  This week, medical student leaders

will descend on Capitol Hill to call for reform of this arcane and inhumane

system that forces young doctors to work such terrible hours, placing

themselves and their patients in danger.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A recent survey of obstetrics/gynecology residents found that nearly 60%

wanted to limit their hours for fear of compromising quality patient care,&quot;

said Jaya Agrawal, national president of the American Medical Student

Association (AMSA), the nation's largest, independent medical student

organization.  Agrawal is a fourth-year medical student at Brown University.

&quot;We know that fatigued residents are more prone to depression, motor vehicle

accidents and pregnancy complications.  We know that, due to preventable

medical errors, as many as 100,000 Americans die each year in hospitals.  It

is profoundly disappointing to me that our colleagues in academic medicine

are so resistant to improving safety in hospitals when patient and physician

lives are at stake.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AMSA is calling on Congress to enact legislation that would limit the

workweek of residents to 80 hours, and limit on-call duty shifts to no more

than 24 hours.  Hospitals receiving funding from Medicare would be required

to comply with these proposed regulations.  Opponents of these reforms have

suggested that internal industry guidelines are more acceptable than

government intervention.  The federal government does, however, regulate the

number of hours airline pilots and truck drivers do their respective jobs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Medical students from across the country will be visiting over 45 Member of

Congress,&quot; according to Rob Levy, AMSA's legislative affairs director and a

medical student at Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.  &quot;Since

the medical community has abdicated its responsibility, the federal

government must intercede here as it has done with pilots and truckers.  The

industry's own lax regulations, which purport to limit hours for different

medical specialties, have been in violation as often as 30% of the time,

while some specialties do not have any work-hour limits at all.&quot;</font></p>
