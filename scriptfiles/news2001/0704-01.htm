- July 4 - Greenpeace activists have invaded a US spy base in North Yorkshire in the UK for a second day running. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">20 protesters again breached security at the Menwith Hills (1) site at 06:45 am this morning (local time). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">14 of the activists were stopped soon after entering the base, but six members of the group are still inside, 4 have started climbing a radio mast. They're joining a New Zealand activist who spent the night occupying another radio mast on the base. The second day of action was set to coincide with 4th of July celebrations in America. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We want to send a clear message to George Bush that his Star Wars program is not welcome here,&quot; said Greenpeace International Disarmament campaigner William Peden, &quot;The Menwith Hills base is described as the eyes and ears of the program, and we want everyone to see and hear our objections&quot;. The best Independence Day celebration would be to be liberated from the threat of a new nuclear arms race, a threat that will become very real if George Bush pursues Star Wars,&quot; Peden added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Star Wars program is reliant upon the use of the listening station at Menwith Hills in North Yorkshire in the UK as well as a second nearby early warning radar base at Fylingdales and another similar facility at Thule in Greenland. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the activists involved in this morning's protest is from Denmark. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe Britain and Denmark should join together to stop Star Wars. Both our Prime Ministers should send a clear message today that Star Wars is not wanted. It can be stopped and it should be stopped,&quot; said Anne Marie Rasmussen </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday over a hundred protesters breached security at the base and spent the day occupying a water tower and adjacent roof top. The last of those protesters were removed just a few hours ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Notes:</i></font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) The Menwith Hill base is rented from the British government by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and is home to over 1,000 American NSA personnel. It is primarily a listening base, which intercepts international phone , fax and email communications. However it also houses two 'golf ball' radomes that are described as.the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; the planned Star Wars system ). Two SBIRS (Space Based Infrared System) Radomes have been constructed in the Menwith Hill complex. If the UK government give the go ahead they will be used as a ground relay station to transmit information on missile location and trajectory back to the US to assist with targetting for ground, sea, air and space based interceptors.</font></i></p>
