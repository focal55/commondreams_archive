- November 13 -  A Sierra Club report released today found a clear

connection between cities' investments in public transportation and their

success at cutting smog per person from cars and trucks. Although most of

America's 50 largest cities failed in their performance at reducing car and

truck smog, those that invested in public transportation suffered from less

automobile pollution per person.</font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If cities invest in public transportation, clean air will come,&quot; said

Carl Pope, Sierra Club's Executive Director. &quot;Cities that invested more in

public transportation reduced their car and truck smog. Although cars are

polluting less per mile, smog isn't getting better, because suburban sprawl

forces Americans to drive farther just to pick up a gallon of milk or take

their kids to soccer. If we give Americans more transportation choices, we

drive less and breathe cleaner air.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, &quot;Clearing the Air with Transit Spending: Sierra Club Grades

America's Fifty Largest Cities,&quot; gave New York State the highest grade in

terms of its spending on public transit. New York is the only state that

spent more money on providing people with transportation alternatives than

on new roads. At the same time, New York City had the least amount of smog

per person from cars and trucks. On the other end of the spectrum, Oklahoma

flunked for having a high amount of smog from cars and trucks per person

and spending a paltry $5.80 on public transit to every $100 it spends on

highway and road construction. Oklahoma completely failed in terms of

spending on transportation choices versus roads.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When cities build more roads instead of cleaner public transportation, it

becomes obvious why smog and air pollution have gotten worse,&quot; Pope

continued. &quot;Our report shows that if you invest in clean transportation

choices, the air really does get cleaner.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cars today typically spew 70% to 90% less pollution per mile than their

counterparts of the 1960s, yet smog is still a serious problem. One of the

main reasons pollution levels are not decreasing as fast as desired (or in

some cases are actually increasing) is more people are driving farther. The

average American driver spends 443 hours per year - the equivalent of 55

eight-hour workdays (more than 10 workweeks) - behind the wheel. Residents

of sprawling communities drive three to four times as much as those living

in compact, well-planned, walkable areas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twenty percent of Americans live in areas where scientists say the air is

not safe to breathe. Breathing smog has been implicated in a range of

illnesses from asthma to pneumonia. We have long recognized smog as a

public health problem. Despite that, smog has actually increased in a

number of regions in the last ten years.  In fact, only ten to fourteen of

207 polluted cities (less than five to seven percent) saw a reduction in

their air pollution in the 1990s.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club recommends that the state and federal government increase

the amount of money set aside for public transit and at least equalize

funding between highways and public transportation. Government should also

plan development wisely to shorten car trips and facilitate public

transportation; and support public involvement in the transportation and

land use planning process. The Sierra Club encourages people to let their

local, state and federal leaders know they want transportation choices for

cleaner air.
