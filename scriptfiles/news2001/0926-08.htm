<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - September 26 -  The new Director of National Programming at the 

historically progressive Pacifica Radio Network banned discussion of the 

attack on the World Trade Center and its aftermath from the airwaves of New 

York affiliate WBAI. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">National Program Director Utrice Leid, on the eve of her departure as interim 

station manager at Pacifica station WBAI (99.5 FM) in New York, instructed 

local public affairs producers this past weekend that they were to refrain 

from broadcasting the programs they had prepared and instead play music and 

poetry.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Beyond the Pale,&quot; a one hour progressive Jewish radio show which had 

prepared a special report on the Sept. 11 attacks and the one-year 

anniversary of the new Palestinian Intifidah, was canceled as a result of the 

edict. &quot;Radio Free Eireann,&quot; a 90-minute program that covers Irish and 

Irish-American issues, refused to abide by the order and took phone calls on 

the World Trade Center tragedy instead.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It&#146;s an astounding irony that Bessie Wash, the Executive Director of 

Pacifica, would promote to Director of National Programming someone who would 

prohibit discussion of the biggest news story of the decade,&quot; said Bernard 

White, the former program director of WBAI and now a staffer with the 

Pacifica Campaign. &quot;How can Pacifica make any pretense of being a legitimate 

news organization when they are likely the only news outlet to forbid 

discussion of a story of such national and global magnitude?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leid further instructed the Arts Director at WBAI to inform Aniruddha Das, 

the South Asian host of the weekly radio show &quot;Asia Pacific Forum,&quot; that his 

voice was no longer to appear on the air. Aniruddha Das&#146;s program has been 

canceled three times since September 11. The latest edition of &quot;Asia Pacifica 

Forum&quot; was to focus on the spate of racial attacks and discrimination faced 

by Muslims and people of Arabic and Asian descent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is outright censorship,&quot; said Das. &quot;It is an absolute outrage that as 

South Asians around the country face harassment and threats following the 

World Trade Center attacks that our voices would be taken off the air.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leid&#146;s promotion to National Program Director comes less than a month after 

an August 10 incident in which she physically accosted Amy Goodman, the host 

of Pacifica&#146;s popular daily public affairs program &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;. The 

American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), which represents 

Goodman and other &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; staff, has declared WBAI an unsafe work 

environment and filed a workplace safety grievance against Ms. Leid on their 

behalf. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodman and the staff of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; left the studios of WBAI following 

the incident and have continued to broadcast from an offsite location within 

the evacuation zone near where the World Trade Centers once stood, pending a 

resolution of their grievance. Leid, in her new position, will now supervise 

Goodman and oversee all national news programming.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica Foundation Executive Director Bessie Wash has blocked the broadcast 

of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and suspended Goodman and her staff without pay, although 

many stations -- including Pacifica station KPFA in Berkeley, CA -- continue 

to air the program.  Since September 11, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; has broadcast a 

daily two hour  &quot;War and Peace Report,&quot; which now airs on public access and 

community television stations around the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During her controversial nine-month tenure at WBAI, Leid has fired or banned 

nearly two dozen producers and staff from the station, including award 

winning African American journalist Robert Knight, and cancelled programs 

dealing with labor issues, housing and the environment. WBAI&#146;s fundraising 

and audience has since declined sharply.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pacifica Campaign is a eight-month old organization of staff and 

listeners alike fighting to preserve Pacifica&#146;s 50-year tradition of 

community-based, listener-sponsored radio.</font></p>
