- June 14 - Today the Senate sent a disturbing message to local communities, educators, and gay and lesbian Americans by passing the Boy Scouts Amendment proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., with a 51-49 vote. According to The Interfaith Alliance (TIA), a national nonpartisan faith-based organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of faith in public life, the amendment affords special protections to groups that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Disguised by right-wing legislators as patriotic, the amendment's true divisive nature was revealed by Helms. In a statement reported by the Associated Press, Helms said the measure was meant to combat &quot;the organized lesbians and homosexuals in this country of ours.&quot; Helms' amendment will block federal money to public school districts that deny the Boy Scouts of America equal access to school facilities on the basis of the group's ban on homosexuals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reacting to the passage of the divisive legislation, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of TIA, made the following statement: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This legislation was not based on patriotism, but rather on prejudice and intolerance. Senator Helms unmasked his true purpose for proposing the Boy Scouts amendment in his remarks today. By voting for this amendment, lawmakers are punishing local communities that value tolerance, respect and compassion for all students. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Congress is also sending a sad message to gays and lesbians who were starting to break through the discriminatory and dehumanizing legislative agenda of the Religious Right. Today's vote represents a step backwards. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I commend those senators who stood up to intolerance and urge the media and others to fully explain this amendment and Senator Helms' intent when they report on this vote today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In our increasingly diverse nation, we should be encouraging schools to adopt non-discrimination policies rather than giving special protection to organizations that discriminate. Local districts should not be forced to give special privileges to such organizations.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Founded in 1994, The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan clergy-led grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote intolerance. With more than 130,000 members drawn from over 50 faith traditions, clergy-led local Alliances in 38 states, and a national network of activists in every state, TIA promotes civility, mutual respect, and cooperation in our increasingly diverse society. </i></font></p>
