- June 18 - We take this step with great sadness. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Christine Todd Whitman was named administrator of the 

Environmental Protection Agency, we praised the choice -- in fact, 

defended her from criticism by New Jersey environmentalists. We 

hoped her political stature as governor of New Jersey would enable 

her to stand up to those in the White House who seek to weaken 

clean air protections. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We also publicly praised Whitman when she announced that EPA 

would proceed with the diesel clean-up standards issued by the 

Clinton Administration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But recent decisions and misleading rhetoric threaten to 

undermine EPA's credibility, which was enhanced by former EPA 

Administrator Carol Browner. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under Whitman, EPA is turning into the Environmental Propaganda 

Agency. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, we have named Whitman this month's &quot;Clean Air 

Villain of the Month&quot; in hope that she will finally use her stature 

to stand up to a hostile White House as many of her predecessors -- 

both Democrat and Republican -- did. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some called on Whitman to resign following her public 

humiliation by the President over carbon dioxide controls and the 

abrupt scuttling of EPA's arsenic standards for drinking water. 

Whitman also raised eyebrows by declaring on May 15 that &quot;no policy 

determination&quot; had been made to drop pending lawsuits against big 

coal-fired utilities -- only two days before Vice President Cheney 

called on the Attorney General to review those suits. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We want to focus here on several recent air pollution control 

decisions that appear to have been dictated by the White House. In 

each case, EPA rhetoric did not serve the cause of truth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Issue No. 1: Harming California's air to expand ethanol markets. 

Last week, EPA officially rejected a request by the state of 

California to waive what would amount to a mandate to use ethanol 

in cleaner-burning &quot;reformulated&quot; gasoline. California had argued 

that an ethanol mandate would increase summer smog. EPA's 

technical experts agreed. In the waning days of the Clinton 

Administration, EPA tried to propose granting California a waiver 

of the mandate. The White House never signed off on the proposal. 

Farm-state senators such as Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) claimed they 

prevented the green light. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enter the Bush Administration. The ethanol industry, led by 

Archer Daniels Midland (a big financial contributor to the new 

President) revved up its lobbying engine. The White House sided 

with ADM and its allies. Soon EPA was crashing to complete a &quot;new 

analysis&quot; aimed at contradicting its previous conclusion -- that an 

ethanol mandate would mean more smog in California. Last week, 

Whitman made official what the White House had told its friends 

more than six weeks ago (long before any &quot;new&quot; analysis could be 

completed): California's waiver request was denied. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whitman asserted the decision was &quot;about enforcing the Clean Air 

Act. We believe they should have clean air, too. And the Clean Air 

Act calls for this oxygenate requirement and we're going to enforce 

the Clean Air Act.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact, the decision was a perversion of the Clean Air Act, and 

embarrassed EPA staffers know it. As the Chicago Tribune noted, 

the decision was driven by &quot;political expediency, not ecological 

concern.&quot; EPA's credibility has been badly damaged by this action. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Issue No. 2: Pollution in the parks. In one of its last 

actions, the Clinton Administration proposed new guidelines for 

states to retrofit old coal-fired electric power plants and other 

big pollution sources that create visibility-impairing &quot;regional 

haze&quot; at national parks and wilderness areas. This proposal was 

frozen for months by the Bush administration. But on May 29 -- 

just as the President was facing criticism for his handling of the 

parks -- Whitman issued a press release saying that EPA &quot;will move 

forward with a proposed rule to help states take steps to control 

haze-causing emissions from older power plants and industrial 

facilities.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The clear impression was that Whitman planned to &quot;move forward&quot; 

with the Clinton rule. Not so, say our sources. In fact, even as 

Whitman was issuing her press release, the White House Office of 

Management and Budget was secretly weakening the earlier proposal. 

The weakened version has still not been made public. Congress 

should investigate this matter thoroughly. Once again, Whitman's 

reputation for veracity has not been enhanced by this effort to 

help the White House with &quot;spin control.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Issue No. 3: Diesel trucks and diesel fuel. As noted earlier, 

in February Whitman issued a press release headlined &quot;EPA Gives the 

Green Light on Diesel-Sulfur Rule.&quot; But it has only recently been 

disclosed that the light may be yellow, not green. While Whitman 

was issuing the press release -- which both she and the President 

have cited as evidence of this Administration's environmental 

commitment -- she was secretly promising the White House that EPA 

would commission an &quot;independent&quot; new study of the rule. This 

&quot;independent&quot; study was avidly sought by the cash-rich petroleum 

industry, which hoped to use it as a pretext to weaken or delay the 

standards rather than spend its cash on cleanup. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is, of course, no reason for an &quot;independent&quot; study. EPA 

already committed to conducting periodic technical reviews. And 

EPA already has an advisory committee on such matters. A separate 

study at this point sends a message to the oil companies: EPA's 

original standards might be weakened and/or delayed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is most troubling here is the lack of candor from the 

agency. It recalls to mind John Mitchell's famous line from the 

Watergate era: &quot;Watch what we do, not what we say.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are watching, and we don't like what we are seeing. </font></p>
