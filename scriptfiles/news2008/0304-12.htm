<p>NEW YORK - March 4 - The American Civil Liberties Union and 
BlackElectorate.com's "Business and Building" Community are proud to announce 
the launch of their partnership to raise awareness of the devastating effects of 
felony disfranchisement on this country’s African-American community. The 
partnership fuses the strengths of each organization – the ACLU’s longtime 
involvement in states which set policy on this issue and BlackElectorate.com’s 
broad audience and close ties with African-American leaders – to give this issue 
greater visibility within the black community in this historic election 
year.</p>
<p>“Today the people of Texas will go to the polls, but 
over half a million Texan citizens will be unable to vote due to a felony 
conviction. Over 165,000 of those disfranchised Texans are black,” said Laleh 
Ispahani, Senior Policy Counsel with the ACLU Racial Justice Program. 
“Disfranchisement runs contrary to fundamental precepts of democracy, human 
rights, and of giving people a second chance, a chance at true rehabilitation.” </p>

<p>In the United 
States, one out of every seven - or 1.4 million 
- African-American men is disfranchised and cannot vote due to a felony 
conviction. This rate is nearly seven times the national disfranchisement rate 
of one in 41 adults. The ACLU and BlackElectorate.com have developed a 
multi-faceted, nationwide plan to raise awareness of this critical voting rights 
issue that includes targeted projects in California, Florida and Mississippi; 
the recruitment of prominent African-Americans to address this issue at rallies, 
conferences and in public service announcements; and the launch of a large-scale 
guerrilla, viral, and street campaign to engage youth that features street 
teams, t-shirts, music, videos, and the ACLU documentary, “Democracy’s 
Ghosts.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>“At a time when many are focused on primary races, candidates 
and debates, it is important to remember that so many individuals in this 
country still do not even have the right to vote. We are proud to form this 
relationship with the ACLU to place a spotlight on an issue that not only 
determines the real winners and losers on the campaign trail, but also reflects 
an aspect of America's racial divide that many wish to ignore,” said Cedric 
Muhammad, Publisher of BlackElectorate.com and Convener of its Business and 
Building Community, a diverse group of entrepreneurs, professionals, activists, 
artists, intellectuals and students drawn from the website's community. <br><br>To learn more about the work of the ACLU and 
BlackElectorate.com to restore voting rights to people with felony convictions,
