WASHINGTON - July 30 - Republicans in Congress, working in concert with the White House, organized a deliberate political strategy to sabotage the Democratic majority in Congress as it responded to a mandate to solve major problems facing the nation, according to a new report released today by the Campaign for America’s Future. With the American public registering overwhelming disapproval of the job Congress is doing, the facts in <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/obstruction" target="_new">today’s report</a> show that Republicans are to blame.</p>
<p>Campaign for America’s Future co-director <strong>Robert Borosage</strong> said that the reputation of the Congress would be very different had the Republican minority and <strong>President Bush</strong> not orchestrated a systematic campaign of obstruction to bottle up any progress.</p>

<p>“Now this is sort of like knee-capping the postman and then complaining that the mail is late,” said Borosage. “As Republicans posture about the do-nothing Congress, it's worth remembering that much would have gotten done had they not been in the way.”</p>
<p>The report shows that the Republican strategy forced a record number of cloture votes — 94 so far — that require a super-majority of sixty votes to end filibusters. This was reinforced by more than 119 veto threats by President Bush, essentially repealing majority rule. Never before has an ideological minority obstructed so many important measures from becoming law.</p>
<p>If Republicans had not adopted this strategy, majorities in both the House and the Senate favored passage of the following:</p>
<p>--<strong>WAR IN IRAQ</strong>: Setting a date certain to bring the occupation of Iraq to an end, freeing up the $12 billion a month in direct costs (almost a half-billion dollars a day) for vital needs here at home, and insuring that soldiers are guaranteed adequate rest and recovery between deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan;</p>
<p>--<strong>ENERGY</strong>: Investing billions in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, creating green-collar jobs, and paying for it by repealing subsidies for oil companies already pocketing the greatest profits in recorded history;</p>
<p>--<strong>HEALTH CARE</strong>: Providing health care for millions of children of working and poor families, giving them with a chance for a healthy start to life, and saving seniors tens of billions of dollars in prescription drug prices by empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk purchase discounts.</p>
