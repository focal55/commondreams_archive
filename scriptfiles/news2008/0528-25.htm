SAN FRANCISCO, CA - May 28 -  Attorneys representing same-sex couples, Equality California and Our Family Coalition filed a legal brief today opposing a request to stay the court’s ruling and prevent couples from marrying for several months. The request to stay the California Supreme Court’s ruling was filed shortly before the Memorial Day weekend by an Arizona-based, right-wing legal group, the Alliance Defense Fund, on behalf of the Proposition 22 Legal Defense & Education Fund.
<P></P>
“Just as we trusted the court would do the right thing when it ruled on whether every Californian should have the opportunity to marry the person they love, we’re hopeful the court will ensure that its decision goes into effect on schedule,” said Geoff Kors, executive director of Equality California.
<P></P>
On May 15, the California Supreme Court ruled that the state may no longer exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage. 
<P></P>
“Couples like Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon have waited more than 50 years for the chance to marry,” Kors continued, referring to one of the couples involved in the landmark marriage case. “The highest court in our state has spoken, and now it is time to let those couples fulfill the dream so many people share — the dream of marrying the person they love.”
 <P></P>
According to a letter sent to County Clerks’ offices today by the California Office of Vital Records, the state will begin granting marriage licenses to lesbian and gay couples on Tuesday, June 17.
 <P></P>
As right-wing groups attempt to block the state Supreme Court’s decision, a new Field Poll released today indicates that public opinion in California has moved a long way toward support of marriage for lesbian and gay couples. According to the poll, 51 percent of Californians agree that lesbian and gay couples should be allowed to marry, while the percentage opposing marriage for same-sex couples has shrunk to 42 percent. Fifty-four percent oppose changing the state constitution to exclude lesbian and gay couples from marriage, while only 40 percent would favor such a change. Ballot measures that start off with a majority in opposition historically go down in defeat.
