<p>BERKELEY, CA - March 4 - From March 14th to 16th, KPFA Radio will
suspend regular programming to broadcast the historic Winter Soldier
Iraq hearings in Washington, DC. The three-day live broadcast will be
co-anchored by former Army medic and KPFA Morning Show host Aimee
Allison and journalist Aaron Glantz.
<P></P>
In 1776, Thomas Paine wrote: “These are the times that try men’s souls.
The summer soldier and sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink
from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the
love and thanks of man and woman.”
<P></P>
In 1971, a courageous group of veterans exposed the criminal nature of
the Vietnam War in an event called Winter Soldier. This March, members
of Iraq Veterans Against the War will give first-person accounts of what
is really happening day in and day out, on the ground. The event will
bring together veterans from across the country to testify about their
experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan - and present video and photographic
evidence of war crimes they have witnessed. In addition, there will be
panels of scholars, veterans, journalists, and other specialists to give
context to the testimony. These panels will cover everything from the
history of the GI resistance movement to the fight for veterans' health
benefits and support.
<P></P>
KPFA will be streaming live audio from the Winter Soldier broadcast at
KPFA.org and warcomeshome.org. War Comes Home will also feature bios,
photos, and videos of the speakers. Online audio clips of the
testimonials will be posted as the hearing progresses. In addition to
hosting the broadcast, Aimee Allison and Aaron Glantz will be blogging
from the hearing at warcomeshome.org, where listeners will be able to
leave their comments.
<P></P>
Up now on KPFA’s <a href="http://warcomeshome.org/" target="_new">War Comes Home</a> site are the audio testimonies of some
Iraq veterans who will be participating in Winter Soldier (at
<a href="http://warcomeshome.org/testimonials" target="_new">warcomeshome.org/testimonials</a>), such as the story of former US Army
Sergeant Logan Laituri who served a tour in Iraq before filing for
discharge as a conscientious objector, who describes how the rules of
engagement he operated under lead to the approved killings of innocent
civilians.
