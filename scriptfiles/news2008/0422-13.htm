<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 22 - Freedom Rider Reverend Ben Elton Cox, will be in Washington D.C. to talk with Chairman of the Judiciary, John Conyers, and Congressman John Lewis about Impeachment today and tomorrow. Rev. Cox came to DC at the request of Leslie Angeline, a member of CODEPINK Women for Peace, who has been campaigning for months to pressure Conyers to introduce Impeachment hearings (tactics have included 26-daylong hunger-strikes by Angeline and others). Reverend Cox, John Lewis and Ed Blankenheim, (Leslie Angeline's father), were among the original Freedom Riders.

<b>MEETING TODAY with Congressman Conyers and his staff<br>

Where: 2426 Rayburn Building<br>

When: Today, April 22, 4:15pm
</b>
<p></p>
Leslie Angeline, a member of CODEPINK, has known Reverend Cox for forty-five years. She called him for counsel on her campaign to get Conyers to introduce Impeachment hearings and Cox decided to travel to DC himself to speak with the Congressman. "Reverend Cox is an amazing mentor and I know he has counsel to offer Congressman Conyers on Impeaching VP Cheney and the current state of injustice imposed by this Administration. Ben, my father and John Lewis were Freedom Riders together during the Civil Rights Movement and if my father were here today, he would have something to say to Conyers too," says Angeline, 51 of San Francisco, California.

To date over 484 people across the country have signed on to CODEPINK’s “Hungry for Justice? Impeach Him Fast” campaign in solidarity on the organization's website (<a href="http://www.codepinkalert.org/" target="_new">www.codepinkalert.org/</a>).
