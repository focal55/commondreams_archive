<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 16 - Catholic and Protestant scholars, pastors and social justice leaders today warned that divisive religious rhetoric from presidential candidates and relentless scrutiny of candidates' faith undermines the proper role religion can play in public life.
<p></p>
While emphasizing the importance of religion in promoting the common good, over two dozen Christian intellectuals, theologians and clergy asked the candidates to affirm that there is no religious test for office or a single faith that that has an exclusive claim to moral values.  
<p></p>
"We are troubled to see candidates pressed to pronounce the nature of their religious beliefs, asked if they believe every word of the Bible, forced to fend off warnings by a few religious authorities about reception of sacraments, compelled to confront derogatory and false allegations of radical Muslim childhood education, and faced with prejudicial analyses of their denominational doctrines," the leaders write in the statement, Keeping Faith: Principles to Protect Religion on the Campaign Trail.
<p></p>
The Catholic, Evangelical, and mainline Protestant leaders called on candidates to affirm three principles to protect religion on the campaign trail: 1) avoid using religious or doctrinal differences to marginalize or disparage each other; 2) acknowledge that no single faith has an exclusive claim to moral values; and 3) recognize that policy positions should reflect the best interests of all citizens regardless of religious belief. 
<p></p>
Democratic and Republican candidates have courted religious voters with extensive faith-based outreach efforts, and people of faith will be a critical factor in the South Carolina primaries held on Jan. 19 and Jan. 26.
<p></p>
"Religion is an indispensable source of spiritual and ethical wisdom that can help us promote the common good and speak to the moral dimensions of our critical policy challenges, but it should never become a political weapon to divide us," said Alexia Kelley, Executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good.
