WASHINGTON - July 18 -South Korean police used excessive force against peaceful protesters demonstrating against the government’s trade policies, Amnesty International said today as it provided preliminary findings of its investigation into human rights violations during the protests against U.S. beef imports that took place in central Seoul between May 25 and July 10.
<p></p>
Amnesty International’s investigation indicated that:
<p></p>
o        In some instances, police used excessive force and abused non-lethal riot control devices such as water cannons and fire extinguishers;
<br>
o        Police engaged in arbitrary arrests of protesters and onlookers;
<br>
o        Some detainees were subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, including a lack of adequate medical care.
<p></p>
The Korean government has not yet carried out adequate investigations of these claims.
<p></p>
“The government should demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law by ensuring accountability for any police officers who used excessive force and providing due process for protesters who face criminal charges,” said Norma Kang Muico, Amnesty International researcher.
<p></p>
“Generally, both the protesters and the police showed remarkable organization and constraint. These protests, and the response to them, generally show the strength of South Korea’s civil society as well as its legal institutions, but we have documented several instances of human rights violations.”
<p></p>
Since early May, tens of thousands of protesters have demonstrated against the renewal of U.S. beef imports over fears of BSE, more commonly known as mad cow disease. The protests, often involving crowds as large as 10,000, were largely peaceful, but there were incidents of violence as riot police sought to control surging crowds. Some protesters attacked and vandalized police vehicles.
<p></p>
During candlelight vigils held on May 31 and June 1, police used fire extinguishers and fired water cannons at close range against largely peaceful demonstrators, causing serious injuries such as blindness, broken bones and concussions.
<p></p>
In one case, a 24-year-old female office worker fell down after the riot police suddenly charged into the crowd. She was surrounded by at least five police officers who hit her with batons and kicked her repeatedly in the head. To protect herself, she covered her face with her arms. As a result, she suffered a broken arm, her head was severely swollen, and she had cuts and bruises on her upper body. She has been hospitalized since June 30, unable to return to work.
<p></p>
Another case involved a 14-year-old boy who participated in the vigils with his mother, classmates and teachers. When the police surged into the crowd, participants ran onto the pavement for safety. A police officer hit the boy with a shield in the back of his head as he tried to run away. He fainted, and his head was bleeding heavily. He was taken to the Yonsei Severance Hospital where doctors stitched his cut.
<p></p>
“These protests involved citizens making their point strongly but, in large part, peacefully. What they were met with, however, was excessive force by their own government, and that deserves a more thorough investigation,” said Kang Muico.
