<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 24 - The Senate is again debating whether to grant retroactive immunity to telephone companies for eavesdropping on American citizens through warrantless wiretaps.
<p></p>
Josh Silver, executive director of Free Press, issued the following statement:
<p></p>
"Phone companies are supposed to deliver our messages, not spy on them. But at every turn, these telco giants trample on basic constitutional principles of privacy and free speech."
<p></p>
"Even as their lobbyists swarm Capitol Hill to sidestep the legal system, phone companies like AT&T are pushing forward with plans to build and deploy technology that would allow them to better spy on and censor their customers' Internet traffic.
<p></p>
"When you break the law you should face the consequences. The American people are counting on Congress to reject immunity and make it clear that phone company spying -- both past and future -- will not be tolerated." <br>
