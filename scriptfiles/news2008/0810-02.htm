TBILISI, Georgia  - August 10 - CARE and other humanitarian agencies are   coordinating with the United Nations to provide assistance to tens of thousands   of people displaced by the violent conflict between   Georgia and   Russia. The   immediate needs of the affected populations include medical supplies, shelter,   food, water and sanitation.</span></p>         <p>"The situation is dire,   hospitals are overloaded, and people are desperate to find safety for themselves   and their families. CARE calls on all parties   to end the violence and allow humanitarian organizations access to people in   need of assistance," said David Gazashvili,   CARE's emergency deputy director who is in   Georgia during   this conflict.</p>         <p>More than 2,000 people, most from South Ossetia, are displaced in   Georgia, with another 8,000 expected to come out from hiding in   the worst-hit areas and face homelessness and devastation. Some 10 to 20   thousand people have fled across the border to   Russia as fighting continues.</p>         <p>CARE is   among the agencies under UN coordination to provide basic necessities in the   midst of conflict and to assess the long-term needs.   CARE   has worked in Georgia since 1992, initially providing humanitarian   assistance to IDPs, and later working in the sectors of community development,   small business development, and good governance. Currently   CARE Georgia has over 70 national and expatriate staff   in the country working in the southern and eastern parts of   Georgia. Their   work has been halted by the conflict.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
