<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 19 - On March 18, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain made
an admittedly false claim to reporters in Amman,
Jordan, asserting that
Iranian operatives are "taking al-Qaeda into Iran, training them and sending
them back" -- an assertion he made not just once, but twice, in the same
press conference.</p>

<p>After Sen. Joe Lieberman
(I-CT), who was with McCain, reportedly whispered something in his ear, McCain reportedly
corrected himself, saying: "I'm sorry, the Iranians are training
extremists, not al-Qaeda."</p>

<p>But it wasn't the
first time McCain made the same false statement. During an interview with
nationally syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt just one day earlier on March 17,
McCain had said, "As you know, there are Al Qaeda operatives that are
taken back into Iran, given training as leaders, and they're moving back into
Iraq."</p>

<p>And how have the media
responded? Has there been wall-to-wall coverage on this major foreign policy
gaffe by a politician that claims to be "ready from day one,"
according to his campaign website? Hardly. As NBC News political director Chuck
Todd observed, "[H]ad Clinton or Obama done something like this, this
would have been played on a loop, over and over." Some reports even
offered possible excuses for McCain. In a post on his Political Punch blog, ABC
News' Jake Tapper wondered, "Jet lag?" after noting Lieberman's
correction of McCain. </p>

<p>"<strong>It looks like that BBQ for the press paid off</strong>,"
said Karl Frisch, a spokesman for <em>Media Matters for America</em> and a former
staffer on McCain's 2000 presidential campaign. "<strong>What exactly is it going to take for the media to
treat Sen. McCain like any other candidate rather than giving him the benefit
of the doubt at every turn? If a progressive had made such a serious, repeated
foreign policy gaffe one thing is clear -- you wouldn't be able to open
the paper, let alone turn on the television or radio, without hearing about
it."</strong></p>

<p>When not brushing off the
incident by making excuses for McCain, reports skipped the gaffe almost
entirely, recasting the Arizona
senator's remarks. Although he later reported that McCain
"mistakenly said Tuesday that Iran was allowing al-Qaida fighters into
the country to be trained and returned to Iraq," Associated Press writer
Alfred de Montesquiou initially reported that McCain "voiced concern that
Tehran is bringing militants over the border into Iran for training before
sending them back to fight U.S. troops in Iraq, and blamed Syria for allegedly
continuing to 'expedite' a flow of foreign fighters." </p>

<p>Similarly, a March 18
United Press International article reported that during the press conference,
McCain "said concern still exists that Iran
could be training Iraqi extremists in Iran
then returning them to Iraq."
In fact, McCain did not refer simply to "militants" or "Iraqi
extremists"; he claimed that Iranian operatives are "taking <em><em>al-Qaeda</em></em> into Iran, training them and
sending them back" and, when pressed to elaborate, asserted that it is
"common knowledge and has been reported in the media that <em>al-Qaeda</em> is going back into Iran and
receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran, that's well
known" [emphases added] -- misstatements that <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> reporters Cameron W.
Barr and Michael D. Shear wrote "threatened to undermine McCain's argument
that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to
lead a country at war with terrorists."</p>

Qaeda-Iran gaffe not his first</a></strong></p>

<p>Some in the media
have echoed the McCain campaign's assertion that he simply "misspoke"
when he said at a March 18 press conference that Iranian operatives are
"taking al-Qaeda into Iran,
training them and sending them back." In fact, McCain made the
misstatement twice during the press conference, and also made it the day before
on Hugh Hewitt's radio show. <a href="/items/200803180007" title="blocked::http://mediamatters.org/items/200803180007">Read More</a></p>

"gaffe" on Al Qaeda</a></strong></p>

<p>The Associated
Press reported that McCain voiced concern about Iran
allegedly training "militants" and sending them to fight in Iraq, while CNN.com's Political Ticker reported
that McCain had referred to "Iraqi extremists" being trained by Iran.
In fact, McCain did not refer generically to "militants" or "Iraqi
extremists"; he claimed that Iranian operatives are "taking <em><em>al-Qaeda</em></em> into Iran, training them and
sending them back" to fight U.S. troops in Iraq, a misstatement that <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> reporters Cameron W.
