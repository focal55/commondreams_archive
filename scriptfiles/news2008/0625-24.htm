RESTON, VIRGINIA - June 25 -  The American Medical Student Association (AMSA), the nation’s largest, independent medical student organization, joins a coalition to demand passage of the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 (S. 2731). The bill commits $50 billion over five years to continue the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The groups will gather in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, June 26, 2008 to rally on Capitol Hill. AMSA’s national president, Dr. Brian Hurley, will speak at the event on behalf of his 67,000 members.
<p></p>
Although the Senate has more than the 60 votes needed to pass this bill, a small number led by Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) have placed a hold on the bill, proposing to flat-fund the program while earmarking the majority of funds for treatment. The White House, the Senate leadership and the presidential candidates have stepped up the pressure to negotiate with this small group of Senators, and the advocacy community is poised with potential congratulations for their success this Thursday.
<p></p>
In a few weeks, the world’s leaders will meet at the G8 Summit in Japan, and global health issues will be high on the agenda. “We are working with our nation’s leadership for passage of the PEPFAR reauthorization bill so that President Bush will have leverage to urge other G8 countries to increase their funding” says Mary Carol Jennings, AMSA’s Jack Rutledge Legislative Director.
<p></p>
“It is Obama’s and McCain’s responsibility as leaders of their respective parties to get this lifesaving bill passed along with Senators Reid and McConnell,” said Joanne Carter, incoming Executive Director of RESULTS, a national grassroots advocacy group. “It may not be their fault, but it is their job.”
