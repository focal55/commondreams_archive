<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 16 - An aggressive stimulus package is needed immediately to address the current weakness of the US economy, according to the latest report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) and the Center for Women and Work (CWW) at Rutgers University.
<p></p>
<a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1428/8/" target="_new">"The Need For An Economic Stimulus Package"</a>, by economists Eileen Appelbaum of CWW, and Dean Baker and John Schmitt of CEPR, stresses the necessity for an immediate stimulus package equal to 1% of GDP to counteract the negative effects of the collapse of the housing bubble.
<p></p>
Several economic indicators point to a softening of the US economy. From the recent 0.3 percentage point rise in unemployment (a jump rarely seen outside of a recession), to a decline in consumption, the US economy is clearly in a downturn, if not entering a recession, spurred by the collapse of the housing market and the loss of trillions of dollars of wealth.
<p></p>
 "The US economy is almost certainly on the verge of a recession," said report co-author Dean Baker. " The adoption of a substantial stimulus package is needed now to lessen its toll and put the nation back on path to economic growth and sustainability."
<p></p>
The <a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1428/8/" target="_new">proposed stimulus package</a> consists of:
<p></p>
    * a $600 tax cut for all taxpayers and workers<br>

    * an energy conservation tax credit<br>

    * a public transportation subsidy<br>

    * a home heating oil provision<br>

    * a temporary revenue sharing component<br>

<p></p>
In adopting this <a href="http://www.cepr.net/content/view/1428/8/" target="_new">package</a>, legislators will be taking a positive step towards shoring up the US economy and creating jobs.
