<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 15 - <br>
  <br>
  WHO:   The National Campaign for Nonviolent Resistance (NCNR), a nationwide movement, was formed for individuals willing to engage in nonviolent civil resistance to protest the war in Iraq and pressure Congress to withdraw all troops from Iraq and provide real reconstruction for Iraq.  The Pledge of Resistance-Baltimore is one of the groups active with NCNR.  

  <P></P>

WHAT:  Members of the Pledge have repeatedly risked arrest to protest the war with Iraq.  On September 20, 2007, they joined with activists from around the country in the crypt of the U.S. Capitol to bear witness to the dead of Iraq and the US and to urge Congress to cut off funding for the continuing occupation of Iraq.  Because the public rarely sees the endemic death and devastation caused by the occupation, NCNR organized a nonviolent die-in, and 34 citizens were moved to participate.  Each participant wore a tee shirt splattered with red paint symbolizing the bloody conflict in Iraq and read the name of an Iraqi or U.S. soldier killed in Iraq.  To further dramatize the conflict, each person fell to the floor.

  <P></P>

These citizen-activists had repeatedly lobbied Congress to cut off funding to end the war, but generally were rebuffed.  A letter requesting a meeting to discuss the funding was sent to majority and minority leaders in the Senate and the House.  No response was received.  Thus the group decided to exercise their First Amendment right inside the Capitol and used theater to make their point.  Unfortunately, though, Baltimore activists Maria Allwine, Susan Crane and Max Obuszewski were arrested along with thirty-one others and charged with disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly.  One person paid a citation fine, but the others are scheduled for trial.

  <P></P>

WHEN:  Wednesday, January 16, 2008 at 9 AM

  <P></P>

WHERE:  Courtroom 120, District of Columbia Superior Court, 500 Indiana Ave., NW, Washington, DC

  <P></P>

WHY:  The die-in was part of The Declaration of Peace DAYS of DECISION campaign (Sept. 14 - 21, 2007), and bore witness to the tragic reality in Iraq.  On September 20, the Senate voted 72-25 to condemn an ad from MoveOn.org that referred to Gen. David Petraeus as “General Betray Us.” Twenty-two Democrats rushed to vote for this meaningless Republican-sponsored resolution.
 <P></P>
 

Also that day Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Russ Feingold sponsored legislation to cut off funding for combat by June 2008, but it was easily defeated 28-70.  Twenty Democrats, including Barbara Mikulski, joined 49 Republicans and Joe Lieberman in opposing the amendment.  Again the will of the majority of citizens to bring the troops home was repudiated.

  <P></P>

During the trial, the 33 defendants will represent themselves and argue that Congress is responsible for funding an illegal war.  Under international law, including the Nuremberg Principles, citizens must take action when their government violates the law.  As well, the pro se defendants will argue that their peaceful die-in is protected under the First Amendment, was not loud and boisterous and did not breach the peace.
 <P></P>
 

It remains to be seen what effect the theatrical die-in which took place on September 20 might have on Congress.  There is a long history, including the Boston Tea Party, where citizen action influenced the government.  But more importantly those who were arrested acted in protest of a bipartisan government policy, which may have resulted in the deaths of possibly one million Iraqis and 4,000 U.S. soldiers.
 <P></P>
 

The die-in was not act of civil disobedience, but rather civil resistance. The government is breaking the law, so the defendants will argue it was their duty to take action.  If the judge finds the group or some of the defendants guilty, it is expected that some of the activists will be incarcerated.
