<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 17 -   Former Bridgeport, Connecticut gun dealer Frank D’Andrea is scheduled to report to prison tomorrow, Friday, January 18, 2008, after pleading guilty to a Federal gun crime.&nbsp; D’Andrea is scheduled to serve three and a half years in prison and pay a $75,000 fine.<br>
<br>
Frank D’Andrea, who owned D’Andrea’s Gun Case and was a “frequent critic of stronger gun-control laws,” was charged with hundreds of gun law violations over the decades he ran his store.&nbsp; The Brady Center compiled his record, and described the human cost of his sales practices in a report titled Guns for Gangs: Profile of a Rogue Gun Dealer – D’Andrea’s Gun Case.&nbsp; This report is available online at http://www.bradycenter.org/xshare/pdf/reports/dandrea_report.pdf.<br>
<br>
“It is very unfortunate that weak gun laws at the national level allowed a rogue dealer like Frank D’Andrea to stay in business for so long,” said Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.&nbsp; “If the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had the resources – and the Congressional mandate – to shut down the worst-behaving gun dealers like D’Andrea on a faster timetable, the tragic human cost resulting from the sale of guns to gangsters and gun traffickers in cities like Bridgeport could be avoided.”<br>

<br>
The Brady Center report offers many examples of D’Andrea’s questionable customers.&nbsp; One was notorious Bridgeport gangster Frankie “the Terminator” Estrada, who said&nbsp; “it was common knowledge in the 1980s and 1990s that D’Andrea was the place to go to buy guns without any questions.”&nbsp; Estrada said he bought “AR-15s, AK-47s, 357s, 45s, 44s, all kinds” of guns from D’Andrea’s Gun Case.<br>
<br>
Another example is gun trafficker Elwood Schular, who admitted to buying at least 177 firearms from D’Andrea in just 13 months, from January 1988 to February 1989.&nbsp; At least one of those guns was used in a homicide.<br>
<br>
D’Andrea also sold numerous firearms to gangster Danny Melendez.&nbsp; In one case, D’Andrea admitted accepting as payment a “bag of cash” from Melendez filled with $5,000 in small bills.&nbsp; <br>

<br>
“Gun dealers like Frank D’Andrea are an example of the terrible price we pay for weak gun laws that coddle corrupt gun dealers,” said Daniel R. Vice, Senior Attorney at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
