<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 26 - For forty-plus years, Riverkeeper has been the Hudson Valley’s chief law enforcer when it comes to safeguarding our water resources.  Riverkeeper established a Policy Department in 2007 in recognition of the important role public policy must play in its efforts to bring about the permanent protection of the Hudson River and the New York City drinking water supply.  Working closely with Riverkeeper’s Hudson River and Watershed staff, the Policy Department has identified legislative initiatives that will support Riverkeeper’s legal work and advance its mission. <br>

<br>
“Clean water is a basic human right,” states Lisa Rainwater, policy director.  “Our communities want and deserve clean water for drinking, fishing, and swimming; clean air to breathe; and natural areas for recreation and aesthetic purposes. The Hudson River and the watershed that provides New York City its drinking water remain under intense pressure from increased development, stormwater runoff, and point source pollution – threatening the ecological integrity of the Hudson River, diminishing the public’s ability to swim, fish, and recreate safely, and degrading the drinking water supply for nearly 9 million people.  In addition to ongoing development pressures, our water is threatened by an ever-increasing reduction in federal funding needed to maintain our aging clean water infrastructure.  In the coming months, Riverkeeper will engage our members to ensure that clean water is a top priority at the local, state, and federal levels of government.”    <br>
 <br>
In Riverkeeper’s Clean Water &amp; Healthy Communities – Legislative and Policy Agenda for 2008, the group presents its long-term policy initiatives, priorities for federal action and state action, and its continuing coalition work with New York partners.<br>
