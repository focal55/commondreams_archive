<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 21 -  <i>The Times</i> of London <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3408155.ece" target="_new">reports</a> that the U.S. government's "decision to destroy a defunct spy satellite orbiting Earth by firing a missile into outer space provoked a diplomatic row today, with both China and Russia accusing the U.S. of having carried out a covert weapons test." <br>

Slater is director of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. She said today: "Right now Bush is trampling on the Chinese-Russian U.N. initiative to ban weapons in space. ... We should be demanding of all the candidates that they take a position on banning weapons in space..."<br>

Young, a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said today: "The public rationale that the satellite shoot-down was done for safety reasons doesn't really hold up to scrutiny."<br>
<br>
Grego, an astrophysicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said today: "If the Pentagon demonstrates that its missile defense systems can destroy satellites, it will be very difficult to convince other countries that they shouldn't develop a similar anti-satellite capability. Moreover, concern that the United States has this offensive capability deployed around the world will likely complicate relations with Russia and China."<br>
<br>
UCS noted in a <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/us-attempt-to-shoot-down-0098.html" target="_new">statement</a>: "Not only has the United States failed to lead efforts to prevent the development, deployment and use of anti-satellite systems, it has for many years opposed international efforts to do so, Grego pointed out. Just last week the Bush administration rejected a draft treaty presented at the U.N. Conference on Disarmament that would ban space weapons and prohibit attacking satellites from the ground or space."<br>
