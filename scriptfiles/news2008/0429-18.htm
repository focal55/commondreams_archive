<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 29 - Today, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney denounced Sen. McCain’s healthcare plan as a boon for the insurance companies at the expense of working people. He promised that AFL-CIO families would be outside McCain’s tour this week - - presenting 175,000 signatures on band-aids - -  to let him know that working people need healthcare reform that will give them a leg up in the souring economy, not another break for corporations and lobbyists.
<p></p>
“Sen. McCain showed his answer to the health care crisis is more power for the insurance industry and fewer protections for working families. He even goes so far as to tax people’s employer-provided health care benefits,” said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney. “Under McCain, quality health care would become like limousines and mansions – something available only to the very rich.”
<p></p>
AFL-CIO families were outside McCain’s speech in Fla. and will be in Allentown, Pa., Cleveland, Ohio, Des Moines, Iowa, and Denver, Colo. to let Sen. McCain know that his healthcare proposals are not the answer to their economic woes. They will call on him to offer proposals that put working people before insurance companies.
<p></p>
Throughout the week, protestors will deliver 175,000 signatures of members of the AFL-CIO community affiliate Working America.  The signatures are on multi-colored band-aids stuck on petitions that say “IN AMERICA, no one should go without health care. It’s time to cap skyrocketing costs, protect our health care, fix a broken health care system and provide secure, high-quality health care for everyone in America. Count me in for healthcare we can count on!” They will hold giant band-aids and signs that call on McCain to “Turn Around America” rather than follow the failed Bush economic policies.
<p></p>
This week’s activities are part of the AFL-CIO’s “McCain Revealed” campaign. In the coming weeks, 13 million union voters will hear from the AFL-CIO specifically on McCain’s healthcare plan. The AFL-CIO is currently in the process of distributing more than 1 million worksite flyers. On May 17, there will be a national door-to-door canvass, when 6,200 volunteers will visit union voters at the doorstep in 125 locations across the country. On May 17 alone, volunteers reach nearly 200,000 doors.
<p></p>
“McCain Revealed,” is an AFL-CIO national campaign to expose Sen. John McCain's economic record and plans to continue the failed Bush economic agenda, and to generate public pressure on him to support policies that advance working families’ interests.
