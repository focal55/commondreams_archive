WASHINGTON - June 25 - On Thursday morning, June 26, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) will present the nation's first comprehensive suite of policies to dramatically reduce the pollution that causes global warming. Experts at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) have worked closely with CARB staff and tracked the plan's development since the state enacted the landmark global warming law, AB 32, nearly two years ago.
  <P></P>
CARB will make copies of the plan available Thursday morning online and at a public hearing in Sacramento. For more information and a Webcast of the hearing, go to: <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/board/ma/2008/ma062608.htm" target="_new">www.arb.ca.gov/board/ma/2008/ma062608.htm</a>.
  <P></P>
Patricia Monahan, the director of UCS's California office, and UCS climate economist Christopher Busch will attend the hearing. Monahan will be available on her cell phone at 510-809-7957. Busch will be available on his cell phone at 510-229-0332. Busch's expertise is in market-based approaches to reduce global warming pollution.
  <P></P>
Spencer Quong, a UCS clean vehicles analyst, will be available at the UCS Berkeley office at 510-809-1571. Quong is an expert in vehicle policy and technology.
  <P></P>
UCS experts have identified three key elements of a comprehensive global warming policy that would significantly cut pollution and strengthen the state's economy at the same time:
  <P></P>
. Boost the state's renewable electricity standard by requiring utilities to generate a third of their electricity from clean, renewable sources by 2020;
. Establish a clean car discount program for new passenger vehicles, under which consumers would receive rebates on cleaner, more efficient cars financed by automaker surcharges on gas guzzlers; and
. Limit the use of "offsets," substitutes for actions polluters must take to comply with state climate standards.
  <P></P>
