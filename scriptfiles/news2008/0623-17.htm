WASHINGTON - June 23 - Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) today released new data showing that while women make up approximately fifteen percent of the armed forces, they account for nearly half of all 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' (DADT) discharges from the Army and Air Force. Women have always been disproportionately affected by the law forbidding openly gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans from military service but the 2007 data shows a significant increase in the ban's impact.
<P></P>
'Women make up fifteen percent of the armed forces, so to find they represent nearly fifty percent of Army and Air Force discharges under 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is shocking,' said SLDN executive director Aubrey Sarvis. ''Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is often used as a weapon of vengeance against service members. Women in particular have been caught in the crosshairs of this counterproductive law.'
<P></P>
In FY 2007 women accounted for 14% of the Army's active duty force while making up 46% of DADT discharges compared to FY 2006 when women represented 17% of the Army and made up 35% of DADT discharges. Similarly, FY 2007 data from the Air Force shows women are 20% of the force but made up 49% of DADT discharges. That number is up from FY 2006 when females made-up 20% of the Air Force and 49% of DADT discharges.

'Our nation is safer and more secure because of the contributions made by all women, including lesbian and bisexual women, in the armed forces,' said Commander Zoe Dunning, USNR (Ret.) and SLDN Board Co-chair. 'The time has come for the Pentagon and military leaders to recommend Congress repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' The ban disrupts troop morale and weakens unit cohesion by forcing commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan, and around the world, to separate qualified and well trained personnel for no other reason than they are suspected of being gay,' added Dunning.
<P></P>
According to statistics obtained from the Pentagon for Fiscal Year 2007, the armed forces continue discharging nearly two service members per day. The separation data shows the number of discharges under 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' have fallen by 50% since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the beginning of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In FY 2007, at least 627 military personnel were dismissed under the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' ban on openly gay service members, up from 612 in FY 2006.
<P></P>
In 2007 the Army discharged 302 soldiers, up from 280 the year before. The Air Force dismissed 91 airmen, down slightly from 102 in 2006; the Navy discharged 166 sailors, the same as the previous year; and 68 Marines were discharged, up from 64 the year before. The Coast Guard, which discharged 11 service members in 2006, has not responded to SLDN's requests for data filed with under the Freedom of Information Act.
<P></P>
The military's need for qualified and experienced personnel continues to grow. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee recently released data showing the Army has doubled the number of waivers it grants to recruits convicted of violent felonies including manslaughter, rape and kidnapping. In an attempt to meet personnel goals Pentagon leaders have recently relaxed enlistment standards regarding age, physical fitness, education and criminal records. The discharge of lesbian and gay Americans, however, continues.
<P></P>
A bipartisan coalition in Congress supports legislation to repeal the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' law. The Military Readiness Enhancement Act (H.R. 1246), is currently co-sponsored by 143 lawmakers. The bill would repeal the current law and allow lesbian, gay and bisexual personnel to serve openly in the armed forces.
