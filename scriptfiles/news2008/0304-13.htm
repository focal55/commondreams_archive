<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 4 - With a House vote on domestic spy legislation rumored to 
occur within days, there are reports of a plan to split the two titles of the 
terrible bill passed by the Senate that gutted the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act (FISA). The Senate bill contains almost no Fourth Amendment 
protections in its Title I, and its Title II contains immunity for 
telecommunications companies that illegally aided the president’s warrantlesss 
wiretapping program. The American Civil Liberties Union urges Congress to not 
rubberstamp the president’s plan to circumvent the Constitution. </p>
<p>The following can be attributed ACLU lobbyist Michelle Richardson:</p>
<p>"We are deeply concerned about the proposal to break the Senate bill into two 
separate measures. If the majority uses bifurcation to leverage substantial 
privacy protections for Americans on wiretapping and adopts changes that allow 
the lawsuits to proceed, that’s a step in the right direction. However, if this 
split merely offers members of Congress the chance to vote on a variation of the 
Senate’s surveillance scheme and full immunity for the telecommunications 
industry, then it’s just a rubberstamp of the president’s scheme. Congress' job 
is to protect the civil liberties of individual Americans and to make sure those 
who have broken the law are held accountable. </p>

<p>"The House held its ground two weeks ago, and polling shows the American 
public is clearly against giving the telecommunications firms a 
get-out-of-jail-free card. Congress should stay strong and not give into the 
president’s power grab. Otherwise, the courageous act of letting the Protect 
America Act expire will be squandered. </p>
<p>"We urge Congress to pass legislation that will protect our civil liberties 
and hold telecommunication companies responsible. The president illegally 
wiretapped Americans for years without telling Congress. Congress can’t expect 
to conduct meaningful oversight in the future if they allow the executive to 
walk all over them now."</p>
