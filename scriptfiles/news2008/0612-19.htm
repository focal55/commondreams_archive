WASHINGTON, DC - June 12 - As record gas and food prices, skyrocketing health care costs and the mortgage crisis continue to hammer the economy, SEIU’s two million members today called on Congress to pass legislation extending jobless benefits.
 <p></p>
“It’s time for Congress to take a stand and extend benefits for the millions of Americans who want to work but can’t find a job during this economic recession,” said SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger. “Yesterday’s vote proves that if President Bush follows through on his threat to veto the measure, there is bipartisan support to override the veto or to keep sending him the bill until he signs it.  Working families across this country are suffering.  What we need now is action to bring about the relief working people need.”
  <p></p>
Last week, in addition to the largest monthly unemployment rate increase in more than 20 years, the average price of a gallon of gas and a gallon of milk both reached $4.
  <p></p>
“We have seen what happens when the economy only benefits corporations and their billionaire CEOs.  Now it’s time to actually do something that puts workers first,” said Burger.
  <p></p>
At last week’s 2008 SEIU Convention in Puerto Rico, members passed a tough political accountability plan as part of SEIU’s ‘Justice for All’ plan to build the new American Dream. The plan will create an initial $10 million fund to take on elected officials who fail to live up to their promises to stand with working families.  Extension of unemployment benefits is just one of the issues on which SEIU will hold politicians accountable.
