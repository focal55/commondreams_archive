A new online video from Brave New Films entitled "Lieberman Must Go" documents the numerous slights and betrayals of his colleagues in the Democratic caucus that Senator Lieberman has exhibited, sometimes ostentatiously, over recent years.  The video is accompanied by a petition directed at the Senators on the committee responsible for making committee assignments in the Senate.  The petition urges committee members to strip Lieberman of his rank and chairmanships in 2009.

Since leaving the Democratic Party in 2006 after losing in the primary election to Ned Lamont, Lieberman has endorsed John McCain for President, disparaged Barack Obama openly and repeatedly, and advocated for continuing the war in Iraq, all while enjoying the full privileges of membership in the Democratic caucus.  Senator Lieberman is likely to address the Republican National Convention in September.

Brave New Films' recent videos have made a measurable impact on their targets.  A recent video documenting John McCain's relationship with Pastor Rod Parsley generated a swarm of media attention that ended in McCain renouncing the pastor's endorsement.  Another video about McCain's flip-flops was the number one most viewed video on YouTube the day after its release and is now up to 2.8 million views.  The New York Times recently profiled Brave New Films in a front page<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/us/politics/29opposition.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin" target="_new"> article</a>.

"Senator Lieberman sits on the far right of the spectrum on the core, central issues of our time: national security and Iraq," said Matt Stoller of OpenLeft.com.  "He has attacked our presidential nominee; he has consistently attacked the position of our caucus.  He has no standing as a Democrat, and should be stripped of his placement within the caucus. The future of Lieberman's standing within the caucus is a litmus test for whether Democratic senators are serious about ending the war."
