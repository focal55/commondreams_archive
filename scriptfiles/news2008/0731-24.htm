WASHINGTON - July 31 - SEIU and Campaign Money Watch issued the following statements today opposing McCain’s energy plan, joining with MoveOn.org and the Sierra Club in attacking McCain on drilling.
<p></p>
"McCain's half-baked ‘plan’ to drill our way out of today’s energy crisis won't offer any real solutions to the millions of hard-working Americans struggling to afford today’s rising energy prices,"
said SEIU Secretary Treasurer Anna Burger. "Mirroring the failed Republican policies of the past, McCain's plan throws money at big business while putting working families last. Americans won't be fooled – we need real economic solutions, not a flimsy promise for the future."
<p></p>
"John McCain hit a gusher of oil money when he reversed his position on drilling offshore,"
said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch. "With 33 lobbyists from Big Oil raising money for, advising, and staffing the campaign, and the millions of dollars that flowed into his campaign on the heels of the reversal, McCain’s decision was not about gas prices. In fact, John McCain's reversal won’t lower gas prices anytime soon, but it did immediately generate millions of dollars in campaign donations."
<p></p>
Campaign Money Watch released a report today detailing the massive campaign contributions McCain has gotten from major oil companies since his decision to change position and endorse offshore drilling. The report can be found at

The statements came the same day as MoveOn.org and The Sierra Club launched ads attacking McCain’s proposal. The two ads can be seen at<br>
