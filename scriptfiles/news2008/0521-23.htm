WASHINGTON, DC - May 21 -  Today the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted 10-9 to overturn the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s refusal to allow California to enforce its historic law to reduce global warming pollution from cars.
 <p></p>
 <b>Following is a statement by David Doniger, NRDC Climate Center Policy Director:
 </b> 
 <p></p>
“The Senate environment committee's action is another sign that the White House's obstruction of California's clean car standards will not succeed. The landmark standards adopted by California and 17 other states will be the single most important step taken so far to curb the heat-trapping pollution that causes global warming.  One way or the other – through this new law, a court case, or a new decision by the next president – Americans will soon have cleaner cars as required by California's clean cars law.”
 <p></p>
