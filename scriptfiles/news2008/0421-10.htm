<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - April 21 - Today (4/21)conservation groups called upon the Bush administration 
to stop delays in listing the Cook Inlet Beluga whale under the federal 
Endangered Species Act. The groups’ actions came in response to a <a href="http://www.fakr.noaa.gov/newsreleases/2008/belugalisting.pdf" target="_new">National 
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) announcement</a> that delays for six months a 
decision whether to list the whale under the federal Endangered Species 
Act. 
</p>
<p>
“The experts agree – the science to list the Cook Inlet Beluga is clear,” 
said Bob Shavelson of Cook Inletkeeper. “But the oil industry and their friends 
in the Bush &amp; Palin Administrations prefer to blur the science to meet their 
political needs. The system of 
checks and balances is badly broken.”</p>
<p>Cook Inlet beluga whale (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) is a genetically 
distinct and geographically isolated population whose numbers have plummeted 
since the 1980’s when NMFS scientists estimated the Cook Inlet beluga population 
numbered approximately 1,300 whales; the National Marine Fisheries Service’s 
most recent surveys show the whale’s population now hovers around 375 animals. 
The whale’s status is so perilous that the scientific experts at the World 
Conservation Union (IUCN) in 2006 placed the Cook 
Inlet beluga on its 
Red List for critically endangered species. </p>

<p>“This appears to be part of a trend to bend science to politics in 
Alaska marine resource 
management,” said John Schoen, Senior Scientist of 
Audubon-Alaska. “We’ve seen the 
same thing with protections for the polar bear, and it begs the question: why 
have these laws if our federal agencies are forced to ignore 
them?”</p>
<p>Cook 
Inlet is the most 
populated and fastest growing watershed in Alaska, and subject to 
many development pressures from oil and gas production, sewage discharges, and 
contaminated runoff and spills, which potentially affect the Beluga whale and 
its habitat. Furthermore, several massive infrastructure projects – including 
the proposed Knik 
Arm 
Bridge, the 
Port of 
Anchorage 
Expansion, the Chuitna 
coal strip mine and the Port MacKenzie expansion - will directly impact some of the 
whale’s most important habitat. 
</p>
<p>The various risks to the Cook Inlet beluga – and the bureaucratic 
reluctance to take action – forced numerous groups, including Cook Inletkeeper, 
Alaska Center for the Environment, National Audubon Society - Alaska State 
Office, North Gulf Oceanic Society, Alaska Community Action on Toxics, Natural 
Resource Defense Council (NRDC), Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Kachemak Bay 
Conservation Society, and the Friends of Potter Marsh and the Anchorage Coastal 
Wildlife Refuge to petition NMFS in 2007 to list the Cook Inlet beluga as 
threatened or endangered under federal law. Petitioners were represented by the 
nonprofit law firm Trustees for Alaska.</p>
<p>
“Contrary to the rhetoric from listing opponents, an 
ESA designation will 
not curtail responsible development. 
Instead, a listing decision will simply ensure that federal agency 
actions do not jeopardize the whales or their habitat,“ said Karla Dutton, 
Defenders of Wildlife. </p>
<p>“In fact, since its inception in 1973, the act has caused the 
cancellation of less than 1 percent of proposed development projects that 
threatened at-risk animals,” said <a href="http://www.defenders.org/about_us/staff/karla_m._dutton.php" target="_new">Karla Dutton</a>, Defenders of 
Wildlife.</p>
<p>
“There is simply no credible scientific dispute; the 
Cook 
Inlet beluga whale is 
one of the most endangered marine mammals in the 
United 
States,” said Brendan 
Cummings of the Center for Biological Diversity. “Today’s decision is yet 
another example of Bush administration favoritism to the oil industry trumping 
sound science and leaving sacrificed whales in its wake .”</p>
<p>Cook 
Inlet is a unique 
setting that supports the southernmost of Alaska’s five beluga 
populations. The Cook 
Inlet offers a true 
estuary environment which is very different from the beluga habitats to the 
north. According to the NMFS, no similar habitats exist in 
Alaska or anywhere else 
in the United 
States.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of bogus reasons not to protect these animals but 
they’re just diversion tactics,” said Andrew Wetzler, director of the Endangered 
Species Project at NRDC. “In the end, this is about the rule of law. The 
Endangered Species Act is absolutely unambiguous: the National Marine Fisheries 
Service was required to make a final decision this month. This administration 
has shown time and time again that they will not address endangered species 
issues, no matter how clear the science may be.” </p><p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/programs_and_policy/wildlife_conservation/imperiled_species/cook_inlet_beluga_whale/index.php" target="_new">Learn more about Defenders' efforts to protect the Cook Inlet Beluga whale population</a>.</p>
