SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA - May 29 -  The California State Assembly passed legislation yesterday (AB 2235) that would require all newly manufactured or imported handguns in California to be “owner-authorized”, or personalized in a way that would allow them to be fired only by authorized persons.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If enacted, the requirements in AB 2235 will take effect eighteen months following the release of a report by the California Attorney General that “owner-authorized” handguns are available for retail sale.&nbsp; New Jersey enacted similar legislation in 2002.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
AB 2235 passed the State Assembly by a vote of 43-33.&nbsp; The legislation, authored by Assemblyman Mark DeSaulnier (D-Martinez), now heads to the State Senate.&nbsp; <br>
<br>

“Owner-Authorized” handguns will help reduce injuries, homicides, suicides, school shootings, and accidental shootings in California,” said Brady Campaign President Paul Helmke.&nbsp; “Now we call upon the State Senate to pass AB 2235,” continued Helmke.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Applying personalization technology to handguns, including grip or fingerprint recognition, would render them inoperable by unauthorized persons.&nbsp; Children and thieves would be unable to fire the weapon thereby helping to prevent both unintentional and intentional gun violence.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
“Consumer product modifications, such as childproof caps on medicine and pool covers, have reduced injuries and saved lives and a product as inherently dangerous as a handgun should have similar 'owner-authorized' capabilities,” said Kay Holmen, the President of the California Brady Campaign Chapters.
