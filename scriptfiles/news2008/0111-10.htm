<p> January 11 - <br>The World Health Organization <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2008/pr02/en/index.html" target="_new">reports </a>on findings just published in the New England Journal of Medicine: "A large national household survey conducted by the Iraqi government and WHO estimates that 151,000 Iraqis died from violence between March 2003 and June 2006."  <br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a href="mailto:les@a-znet.com" target="_new">LES ROBERTS</a></b><br>
Roberts is co-author of a study published in October 2006 by the leading medical journal <i>The Lancet</i> that estimated 655,000 excess deaths following the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.<br>

The following are excerpts from a statement released by Roberts: "I think that this new article in the NEJM is a good addition to the discussion. ... There is far more in common in the results of the two reports than appears at first glance.<br>
<br>
"The NEJM article found a doubling of mortality after the invasion, we found a 2.4 fold increase. Thus, we roughly agree on the number of excess deaths. The big difference is that we found almost all the increase from violence, they found one-third the increase from violence. ...<br>
<br>
"This new estimate is almost four times the 'widely accepted' [Iraq Body Count] number from June of 2006, our estimate was 12 times higher. Both studies suggest things are far worse than our leaders have reported.<br>
<br>
"There are reasons to suspect that the NEJM data had an under-reporting of violent deaths.<br>
<br>
"They roughly found a steady rate of violence from 2003 to 2006. Baghdad morgue data, Najaf burial data, Pentagon attack data, and our data all show a dramatic increase over 2005 and 2006. ...<br>
<br>
"It is likely that people would be unwilling to admit violent deaths to the study workers who were government employees.<br>

<br>
"Finally, their data suggests one-sixth of deaths over the occupation through June 2006 were from violence. Our data suggests a majority of deaths were from violence. The morgue and graveyard data I have seen is more in keeping with our results." <br>
