<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 18 -After 5 years of anti-war marches, rallies and lobbying, with nearly 4,000 US military dead, most in Iraq living on 2 hours of electricity a day, and a sinking economy, thousands of peace activists are converging this week on Washington, D.C. Over the next 2 days the women of CODEPINK will lead provocative, creative street actions to restore the Constitution and condemn war profiteers and Congress for buying Bush's war. The anti-war movement is ratcheting it up a notch with a call for massive direct action in Washington D.C. and hundreds of cities across the country.
