<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->WASHINGTON, DC - June 18 - Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) today strongly condemned President George W. Bush’s awarding of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Peter Pace.  During a March 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Pace called lesbians and gays “immoral” before adding, "I believe homosexual acts between two individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts.” <br> <br>“Honoring General Pace with the country’s highest civil award is outrageous, insensitive and disrespectful to the 65,000 lesbian and gay troops currently serving on active duty in the armed forces,” said Aubrey Sarvis, SLDN’s executive director.  “Our men and women in uniform are making tremendous sacrifices for our country and are looking for the President to recognize leaders who offer them praise and vision, not condemnation and scorn.”</p><p>President Bush will honor Pace alongside five other recipients at a White House ceremony on Thursday, June 19th. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, recognizes exceptional meritorious service. The medal was established by President Truman in 1945 to recognize notable service in World War II. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy reintroduced it as an honor for distinguished civilian service in peacetime.</p><p>In Sept. 26, 2007 testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Pace expanded on his earlier remarks by saying, “we should respect those who want to serve the nation but not through the law of the land, condone activity that, in my upbringing, is counter to God's law.”  “All I'm saying is that in my responsibility -- with the authority I've been given and responsibilities I've been given -- are to obey the law of the land and to object if something is either illegal or immoral,” continued Pace.</p><p>Statistician Gary Gates at the Williams Institute at the University of California-Los Angeles estimates at least 65,000 lesbian and gay Americans are currently serving on active duty and the reserves while another 1 million gay Americans are veterans of the armed forces. </p><p>“Regardless of one’s opinion about ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ every service member deserves respect,” said Sarvis.  “As Commander and Chief, the President should condemn General Pace’s remarks and express support to all our men and women in uniform, gay and straight.</p>
