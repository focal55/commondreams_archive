<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 9 - Kicking off the numerous whistleblower events around Washington, D.C. next week will be an expert panel focusing on the federal government’s secret domestic surveillance scandal. This panel is being sponsored by the Government Accountability Project (GAP).

 
<p></p>
<b>What:</b>              <b>Secret Domestic Surveillance
</b>
<p></p>
 

This workshop will discuss the implications of the National Security Agency (NSA) eavesdropping program on the First Amendment. It will also address warrant-less wiretapping in the context of attorney-client communications, terrorism investigations, the “state secrets privilege,” and consider the implications for pending congressional showdowns such as telecom immunity in FISA legislation.

 <p></p>

 <b>Who: Panelists Include </b>
 <p></p>
 

                +<b> Jesselyn Radack</b> (Moderator), GAP Homeland Security Director.<br>

                + <b>Eric Lichtblau</b>, Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist who broke the government’s secret surveillance program.
            <br>
    + <b>Michelle Richardson</b>, Legislative Counsel, ACLU<br>

                + <b>Babak Pasdar</b>, telecommunications whistleblower whose disclosure is credited with turning the tide in the House of Representatives denying corporate immunity in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).
               <br>
 + <b>Linda Lewis</b>, USDA whistleblower who disclosed a course manual for USDA employees on how to infiltrate and spy on citizen organizations.

 <p></p>

 <b>This event will take place from 9:00am – 9:55 am at the Stewart Mott House in Washington D.C., at 122 Maryland Avenue, NE. </b> 
 <p></p>

Other panels will follow the event at the Mott House, including panels on Aviation Safety & Security, and Scientific Freedom.
