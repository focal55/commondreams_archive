WASHINGTON, DC - May 16 - Several people were killed in a missile strike in northwest Pakistan's Bajaur Agency on Wednesday. The Dawn newspaper reports that local witnesses saw unmanned US drones fire two missiles on a compound where militants had gathered for dinner. The U.S. has not confirmed its involvement, but is believed to operate predator drones into Pakistan out of Afghanistan. In 2006, a drone missile killed 82 people, and a spate of strikes this March killed 25 people in the same region.

On Thursday, several thousand protesters led by Islamist political party leaders attended anti-US and anti-Musharraf rallies in response to "the U.S. aggression", which is suspected to have been agreed to some extent by Pakistani authorities.

The U.S. led violence is not restricted to the tribal areas of Pakistan. Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston reported that following his 12 day fact-finding mission, he found that around 200 Afghan civilians have been killed this year alone by international military forces.

From Islamabad, Washington Post special correspondent Imtiaz Ali described the situation in Damadola. The complete video interview and transcript can be viewed at the link below located at The Real News Network website:
