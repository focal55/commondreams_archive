WASHINGTON, DC - May 22 - As the Senate prepares today to take up legislation that would offer some relief to working families who desperately need help, we urge them not to thumb their noses at millions of working men and women who are struggling to make ends meet.
<p></p>
Extending unemployment benefits is the right thing and the responsible thing to do, and now is the time. Working families are footing the bill for the war. The least Congress can do is give them the help they need in these tough times. The extension would also provide a badly needed boost to the economy, putting money in people’s pockets to spend on basic necessities for their families.
<p></p>
 Over 200,000 workers are exhausting their state unemployment benefits every month, and an estimated 3.5 million workers will exhaust their state benefits over the next year. Long-term unemployment rates are already higher than at the beginning of 2001 and 1990-91 recessions, and the rate is the same as when Congress wisely extended benefits during those last two recessions. In fact, there is now one job available for every two people actively seeking work.
<p></p>
The amendment also includes a temporary one-year moratorium on controversial Medicaid regulations. The combined effect of stopping these regulations would be a reduction in federal spending on Medicaid by $20 billion over 5 years. Imposing this moratorium would reduce federal spending while allowing for the necessary health care coverage for those who need it most.
<p></p>
We strongly urge the Senate to include the unemployment benefits and Medicaid changes in the bill they send to President Bush. <!-- #EndEditable -->
