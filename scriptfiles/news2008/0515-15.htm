WASHINGTON, DC - May 15 - The leaders of six national
environmental and public interest groups warned today that the impending
Lieberman-Warner climate change bill could contain at least $544 billion in
taxpayer subsidies for nuclear energy. This would represent the biggest federal
handout in history for the nuclear industry, already the most heavily
subsidized energy sector over the past 50 years.</span></p>



<p><span>The
Lieberman-Warner bill is expected to be on the Senate floor in early June.
According to an analysis conducted by <a href="http://www.foe.org/pdf/Lieberman_Warner_2-1_Update.pdf" target="_blank">Friends of the
Earth</a>, the bill contains close to half a trillion dollars that can be
accessed by the nuclear energy industry under a vaguely entitled category for
“zero and low carbon energy technologies.” Nuclear is the only energy industry
that could fall under this category that does not have a specific carve
elsewhere; funding for renewable energy is identified separately in the bill. </span></p>



<p><span>“Although
the word ‘nuclear’ has been carefully omitted from the bill, it is clear that
this is a covert attempt to bolster a failing nuclear power industry in the
name of addressing climate change,” said Brent Blackwelder, president of <a href="http://www.foe.org/" target="_blank">Friends of the Earth</a>. “It’s time to focus on
real global warming solutions like solar, wind and energy efficiency, not to
further fatten the moribund nuclear calf.”</span></p>



<p><span>The
environmental and public interest group leaders decried the bill’s
record-breaking giveaway to nuclear power which would encourage new
construction of nuclear plants, the least-effective way of reducing carbon
emissions because of their long construction times and high costs. </span></p>



<p><span>"After
50 years of unresolved safety and waste disposal issues, it perplexes many
Americans why Congress would support massive subsidies for the nuclear
industry,"&nbsp;said John Passacantando, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/" target="_blank">Greenpeace USA</a>. "Nuclear power
is a dirty and dangerous distraction from real global warming solutions,"
said Passacantando. "When both Wall Street and Warren Buffet think nuclear
is a risky investment, Congress should not waste American tax dollars to
further subsidize this 1950s technology."</span></p>



<p><span>Furthermore,
the leaders stated that even while enriching the nuclear industry, the bill does
not adequately reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid even the most
catastrophic impacts of global warming, as identified by the scientific
community.</span></p>

<p><span>“It’s
significant that the authors of the bill tried to conceal the nuclear funding
under ambiguous language,” said Joan Claybrook, president of <a href="http://www.citizen.org/" target="_blank">Public Citizen</a>. “Why are they hiding it?
Because they know that the environmental movement in this country is serious
about addressing climate change and will not tolerate a reversion to dangerous,
dirty and expensive nuclear energy.”</span></p>



<p><span>“Taxpayers
should not be asked to continue bankrolling a nuclear power industry that has
never been financially or environmentally viable, especially in times of tight
budgets,” said Sandra Schubert, <a href="http://www.ewg.org/" target="_blank">Environmental
Working Group</a> Director of Government Affairs. “Instead, the federal government
should do everything in its power to rapidly pursue clean energy solutions like
solar and wind.”</span><!-- #EndEditable -->
