TBILISI - August 13 - Human Rights Watch in Tbilisi has received alarming reports that civilians are trapped in villages in the Gori district of Georgia that are currently under Ossetian control.  
 <br>
<br>

A Human Rights Watch researcher spoke with a village official from the Gori district who has been in contact with the trapped villagers. Vasiko Tevdorashvili, the official, said the villagers were terrified and in need of a safe corridor out of the area. Tevdorashvili said hundreds of villagers feared attacks by Ossetian militias, who had burned at least three villages in Gori district—Koshki, Guguaantkari, Zariantkari.

“All forces should immediately ensure a safe way for civilians to leave the area,” said Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “They should ensure that civilians are fully protected from attacks and reprisals.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
