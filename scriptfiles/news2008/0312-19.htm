<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 12 - "We face a climate that has been compromised. Our environment has been compromised. Our future has been compromised, and the Lieberman-Warner bill is a compromise that we cannot afford.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While we have great respect for Senator Boxer and appreciate the leadership she is showing on global warming, it is premature to suggest that there is unity behind 'America's Climate Security Act' as introduced by Senators Lieberman and Warner. The legislation is more a reflection of the pitfalls of political compromise than a real solution to safeguard the planet.
<p></p>
"To address the climate crisis, the bill's emission targets must be science based and therefore achieve global warming emission reductions of at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.  Near term targets should be strengthened significantly to 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
<p></p>
"Instead of providing windfall profits to the coal, oil and gas industries, revenue generated from an emissions cap must be used to achieve additional reductions in emissions, pay for transitions in employment for American workers, and offset any short-term energy cost increases on low- and middle-income families.
<p></p>
"The task before us is possibly the greatest of our lifetime and affords no further compromise. The climate, the environment and our very future hang in the balance." <!-- #EndEditable -->
