KABUL - July 9 -Afghanistan's foreign ministry on Tuesday condemned the suicide bomb attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul. It was the deadliest blast since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Forty-one people were killed and 150 were wounded. Afghanistan quickly blamed Pakistan, but Pakistan's prime minister, Gillani, denied that its intelligence service was behind the attack.

Graeme Smith, Globe and Mail reporter who has been in the region since the entrance of NATO forces, told The Real News Network that while the Taliban is currently receiving support within Pakistan, many of those behind the recent wave of attacks are Afghans. One of the factors driving the spread of the insurgency, he said, is the "franchise expansion" – various groups that are not necessarily taking orders from the same place, fighting the Afghan government.

"We're in the middle of the largest wave of violence this country has seen since the fall of the Taliban regime," said Smith. "And actually, probably, the largest wave of violence this country has seen probably in the last decade or so."
