<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 7 - Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said the organization launched an automated call that will reach more than 82,000 households of pro-choice Independent voters on the day before the New Hampshire presidential primary. </p>
<p>Polls show that many Independent voters, who will account for an estimated 45 percent of the turnout in tomorrow's primary, are undecided in the presidential contest.</p>
<p>"We are committed to electing a pro-choice president in November 2008," Keenan said. "With so many undecided Independent voters in New Hampshire, it is critical that they know which candidates share their pro-choice values. There are many issues at play in this race, but choice is one issue on which there is no gray area. Huckabee, Romney, and McCain are among the candidates who are even more publicly anti-choice than George W. Bush and have called for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. These candidates might try to downplay their anti-choice views in this pro-choice state, but we will make sure that pivotal voters who support women's freedom and privacy know that these Republican candidates are out of step with New Hampshire voters."</p>
<p>New Hampshire residents have a long and well-documented record of opposition to political interference in women's personal, private medical decisions. In 2006, Granite State voters, including a majority of Independent voters, reelected pro-choice Gov. John Lynch and elected two new pro-choice members of Congress, Reps. Paul Hodes and Carol Shea-Porter. Voters also returned the state legislature to pro-choice hands, thus opening the door for the successful bipartisan repeal of a dangerous and divisive anti-choice law in the 2007 session. </p>
<p>The automated message from Keenan spells out the anti-choice records of Mike Huckabee, John McCain, Mitt Romney, and Fred Thompson. Keenan urges Independent voters to support a Democratic candidate, each of whom supports a woman's right to choose. In fact, most have earned NARAL Pro-Choice America's endorsement in previous campaigns.</p>
<p>The script of the automated call follows:</p>

<p>This is Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, the political leader of the pro-choice movement. </p>
<p>Tomorrow's primary is critically important for the future of a woman's right to choose. If you believe that women – not politicians – should decide what's best for them, then I urge you to request a Democratic ballot and vote pro-choice tomorrow.</p>
<p>All of the Republicans running for president have supported anti-choice policies. </p>
<p>John McCain, Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson and Mike Huckabee are so extreme that they want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade which could make abortion illegal even in cases of rape and incest. </p>
<p>Huckabee has said he'd support a constitutional amendment, versions of which could outlaw not only abortion, but birth control, stem cell research and in vitro fertilization, too.</p>
<p>All the Democratic candidates running for president are pro-choice and will support and defend a woman's right to choose.</p>
<p>If you value freedom and privacy, please vote tomorrow for the pro-choice Democratic candidate of your choice. </p>
<p>I thank you for your time.</p>
