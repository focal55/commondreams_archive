 WASHINGTON - June 24 - The three major US networks are only dedicating an average of 2 minutes per week to coverage of the war in Iraq according to the New York Times. The report is based on information gathered by a TD consultant who found that CBS evening news spent the least amount of time reporting on the Iraq war, followed by ABC world news and NBC nightly news, respectively.
<P></P>
Among the information not reaching US citizens is that there have been more than 1 million Iraqi deaths since the beginning of the 2003 US invasion, with anywhere from 600 000 to 1.2 million of them being violent. The underreporting of events in Iraq has also left US citizens largely unaware of the millions of Iraqi widows of war and 5 million displaced Iraqi citizens. Some direct blame at the Pentagon for the US public's ignorance of the large number of deaths, but Donald Rumsfeld defends the Department of Defense by insisting that they "don't do body counts on other people."
<P></P>
It isn't just Iraqis that are going unnoticed, however. The US news is even failing to report or show their own soldiers returning home in body bags. Lara Logan, a foreign correspondent for CBS news commented on this issue asking "who in America knows what [the body of a dead American soldier] looks like" and saying that "the American soldiers do feel forgotten."
<P></P>
The Real News Network analyst Pepe Escobar notes that "Iraq is a human disaster worse than 9/11, Iraq is a human disaster worse than Katrina, Iraq is a human disaster worse than the cyclone in Burma/Myanmar, or the earthquakes in China for that matter, but for US networks it's not newsworthy." ?
