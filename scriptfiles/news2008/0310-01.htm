<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 10 -  A wide range of pharmaceuticals that include antibiotics, sex
hormones, and drugs used to treat epilepsy and depression, contaminate
drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, according to a
5-month investigation by the Associated Press National Investigation Team
released today.
<P></P>
³Environmental Working Group¹s (EWG) studies show that tap water across the
U.S. is contaminated and now we know that millions of Americans are also
drinking low level mixtures of pharmaceuticals with every glass of water,²
said Jane Houlihan, EWG Vice President for Research.  ³The health effect of
this cocktail of chemicals and drugs hasn¹t been studied but we are
concerned about the effects on infants and others who are vulnerable. Once
again, the press is doing EPA Œs work when it comes to informing the public
about contaminated tap water. ³
<P></P>
Environmental Working Group analysis shows that of the top 200 drugs in the
U.S., 13 percent list serious side effects at levels less than 100
parts-per-billion (ppb) in human blood, with some causing potential health
risks in the parts-per-trillion range. EWG calls on EPA to take swift action
to set standards for pollutants in tap water that will protect the health of
Americans nationwide, including children and others most vulnerable to
health risks from these exposures.
<P></P>
Drug residues contaminate drinking water supplies when people take pills.
While their bodies absorb some of the medication, the rest of it is flushed
down the toilet. Drinking water treatment plants are not designed to remove
these residues, and the AP team uncovered data showing these same chemicals
in treated tap water and water supplies in 24 major metropolitan areas
around the US. EWG¹s national tap water atlas shows tap water testing
results from 40,000 communities around the country.

<P></P>
All of the pharmaceuticals reported in drinking water supplies are
unregulated in treated tap water ­ any level is legal.  Not only has the EPA
failed to set standards for pharmaceuticals, but also they have failed to
require utilities to test for these chemicals. The drug residues in tap
water join hundreds of other synthetic chemicals Americans are exposed to
daily, as contaminants in food, water, and air, or in common consumer
products. EWG found an average of 200 industrial chemicals, pesticides and
other pollutants in umbilical cord blood from 10 babies born in the U.S.,
indicating that our exposures to toxic chemicals begin in the womb, when
risks are greatest.
