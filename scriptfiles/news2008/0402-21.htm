<p>NATIONWIDE - April 2 - CODEPINK:&nbsp;Women for Peace is stepping up a new campaign for
Impeachment hearings for Vice President Cheney, as part of a coalition of
national groups calling on Congress to start House Judiciary Committee hearings
to investigate possible "high crimes and misdemeanors" which could
lead to the impeachment of Vice President Cheney. They launched their sit-in yesterday
and are continuing throughout this week with other community leaders such as: Faye
Williams, Andy Shallal (invited) business owner and founder of Iraqi Voices for
Peace, Reverend Hagler, David Swanson of AfterDowningStreet.org, a representative
from National Organization of Women, Reverend Ben Cox, one of the Freedom Riders
of the Civil Rights era and local Iraq War veterans. The gathering of community
leaders will happen in the House Judiciary Committee Office on Thursday, April
3<sup>rd</sup> at 10am (Rayburn 2138).</p>
  <p>CODEPINK started the campaign "Hungry for Justice?&nbsp;Impeach him
FAST!" two months ago, on Rosa Parks Birthday, and to date over 484 people
across the country have signed on to the fast in solidarity on the
organization's website (<a target="_new" href="http://www.codepinkalert.org/">www.codepinkalert.org/</a>).
    <br>
    <br>

Other groups, including After Downing Street, We the People National Coalition
for Impeachment, and Impeach for Peace are also gathering supporters for
impeachment.&nbsp; Fast organizers Leslie Angeline and Ellen Taylor have met
with Chairman John Conyers, who remains noncommittal about starting impeachment
hearings, but encouraged them to keep the conversation going. Wednesday, April
2<sup>nd</sup>, CODEPINK is inviting citizens to come to the House Judiciary
Committee Office to continue the national conversation for Impeachment of Vice
President Dick Cheney.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>"My father was one of the original Freedom Riders in 1961.&nbsp; I grew
up hearing the incredible stories of people putting their bodies on the line
for justice.&nbsp; I want to remind the Congressman of this time when the
government told the people to "be patient" and the country said
"NO!"&nbsp;said Leslie Angeline of CODEPINK, who started the fast. 
    <br>
    <br>

"Chairman Conyers may not yet be convinced, but perhaps he'll recognize
that the process itself has value beyond the outcome - that it could start a
tidal wave of hope and change that could sweep the country, like the Watergate
hearings" added Ellen Taylor of CODEPINK.</p>Great Photo Opps! For interviews or more info you can also contact Dana
