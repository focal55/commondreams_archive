SANTA BARBARA, CA - July 24 -<span>Teenager Erik Choquette  wrote and created a remarkable animated video to claim the $1,000 first prize in the 2008 Swackhamer Disarmament Video Contest.

 
<P></P>
The top three videos can be viewed on line at <a href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/contest_winners.php" target="_new">http://www.wagingpeace.org/contest_winners.php</a> .

“I’m incredibly uncomfortable living with the fact that there are almost 27,000 nuclear weapons in the world,” he said when he received his first place check. “We have used these [nuclear weapons] on people. I want to help make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

 <P></P>

Erik, 16,  is going into his junior year at Santa Barbara High School. Starting  this autumn, he will be the Director and Editor of the SBHS News Bulletin – a 15 minute weekly newscast of school events. He said the prize money would go into a savings fund for his first car – he plans to get his drivers’ license soon.

“Erik’s video is a powerful and creative expression by a concerned young person,” says Nuclear Age Peace Foundation President David Krieger. “It sends a message to other young people – as well as older people – that US leadership is essential as we work  towards a world free of nuclear weapons.”
<P></P>
Second prize, and $750, went to the animated video,  "Wooden Bombs" by Drew Madson of Minnetonka, Minnesota.  Third prize, and $250, was awarded to "Testing" by Sagesse Graham of Seattle, Washington.
<P></P>
All videos had to be three minutes or less.
<P></P>
The topic for the contest  was: "There are about 27,000 nuclear weapons in the world today. Use your creativity to make a short video about why US leadership is necessary to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons."
<P></P>
This year’s Swackhamer Disarmament Video Contest  was a first for the Foundation. The Swackhamer was an essay competition in past years.
<P></P>
 

The video contest will be held annually. There will be an announcement about the next contest in March 2009.<!-- #EndEditable -->
