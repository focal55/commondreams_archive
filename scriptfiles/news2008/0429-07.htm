<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 29 - The NAACP is deeply alarmed by   today’s U.S. Supreme Court decision that would allow the utilization of photo   identification at polling places in upcoming elections. 
<p align="left">In a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme   Court rejected a challenge to Indiana’s voter   identification law, the most restrictive in the nation. The American Civil   Liberties Union's case, <em>Crawford v. Marion   County Election Board</em> — consolidated with <em>Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita </em>— was   an appeal of two lower court decisions that upheld the state's law requiring   voters to present government-issued photo IDs in order to vote. The ACLU, NAACP   and others argued that the Indiana law creates   an unconstitutional burden on voting rights.</p>

  <p>“As the dissent notes, Indiana’s law   will sadly but predictably have its greatest impact on tens of thousands of   voters in any state who are poor, elderly, belong to racial minorities, or have   disabilities,” said NAACP Interim General Counsel Angela Ciccolo. “Many of whom   are less likely to have or carry a photo ID or have the means to secure such an   identification.”</p>
  <p>“Mandated photo ID programs would   create a modern-day poll tax for voters throughout the country,” said NAACP   Washington Bureau Director Hilary Shelton. “This is both discriminatory and   inconsistent with historic policies to eliminate poll taxes.&nbsp; Even if states   provided everyone of voting age an ID at no charge, they could not guarantee   that every poll worker would apply the mandates in a fully equitable manner.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Such ID requirements also do nothing   to address many of the actual, documented problems of   election and voter fraud which continue to plague the electoral process and our   democracy, including the improper   purges of voters, distributing false information about when and where to vote,   stuffing ballot boxes, and tampering with registration forms, most of which are   perpetrated by corrupt election officials, not voters.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The NAACP asserts there are many   other ways of establishing identification at polling places other than a photo   ID, which creates potential for fraud among other difficulties. The NAACP urges   state and local elected officials to consider the use of other methods that can   be applied in a much more equitable manner at the polls, should identification   be made mandatory in their jurisdiction</p>
  <p>The Supreme Court's decision on the   constitutionality of voter ID laws has broad national significance with the 2008   election underway. Indiana is one of   more than 20 states that have passed restrictive voter ID laws, while other   states are considering similar legislation. Voter ID measures are not unique to   Indiana.&nbsp;The NAACP   has successfully fought battles in Georgia and Missouri, for   example, against unreasonable&nbsp;voter ID laws that are really designed to suppress   the vote.</p>

  <p>The added burden of requiring a   government-approved photo identification before voting flies in the face of the   Constitutionally guaranteed right to cast a free and unfettered ballot, as well   as the intent of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which prohibits state and local   governments from establishing laws or policies which would have a discriminatory   effect on the ability of certain groups to vote.</p>
  <p>President   Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act into law in 1965. It is designed to prevent   barriers to voting such as: intimidation, voter harassment, the poll tax, voting   instructions printed only in English, literacy tests, racial gerrymandering and   other tools of disenfranchisement. The act further guarantees that no federal,   state or local government shall in any way impede or discourage people from   registering to vote or voting because of their race or color. </p>
  <p>Plaintiffs in the ACLU's case   included the NAACP Indianapolis Branch as well as organizations representing the   elderly, the homeless, and people with disabilities, along with two elected   officials.</p>
  <p>Founded in 1909, the   National Association   for the Advancement of Colored People is the nation’s oldest and largest civil   rights organization. Its more than half-million adult and youth members   throughout the United States and the   world are the premier advocates for civil rights in their communities and   monitors of equal opportunity in the public and private sectors.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
