  August 8 - The decision by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down amid corruption allegations has left many questions in Israel and in the region. What this could mean for the stalled peace process with the Palestinians will depend mostly on the next US president. But on the question of Iran, there is still fear that Israel might act unilaterally.
<P></P>
There are two main contenders to replace Olmert as leader of the Kadima Party. The front-runner, Tzipi Livni, is a former Mossad operative and the current Foreign Minister. Her main Kadima rival is Shaul Mofaz, a former general and the current Transportation Minister. Calls for a general election came from Israeli opposition leader Benyamin Netanyahu of Likud. Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister from 1996 to 1999, is a hardliner who rejects the call for peace through withdrawal from occupied territories. Ehud Barak, leader of the Israeli Labour Party which is part of the ruling coalition with Kadima, will also be in the running. Barak is a former general and was Prime Minister from 1999-2001. As the current Defence Minister, Barak said that Israel will return to its pattern of air stikes to crush Gaza despite the month-long truce.
