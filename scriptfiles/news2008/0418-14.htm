<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 18 - ­ A day after the world¹s largest retailer announced
plans to pull all products containing the toxic chemical BPA from store
shelves, Canada began moving forward with a total ban of the toxic chemical.
Environmental Working Group (EWG), whose investigations of BPA in consumer
products have driven the campaign to ban the compound, said the Canadian
government¹s action is good news, but action is still needed in the U.S.
<p></p>
"We applaud Canada's decisive action to reduce babies' exposure to bisphenol
A through restrictions on polycarbonate bottles and infant formula
containers," said EWG Executive Director Richard Wiles. "The rapid response
by major retailers like Walmart and Nalgene shows that retailers can and
should take immediate action to provide parents with safer products. At the
same time, we call on the U.S. government to provide the public with the
same protections as our northern neighbors."
<p></p>
Coming on the heels of the announcement by the Canadian government, U.S.
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) today announced plans to introduce legislation
that would implement a widespread ban of BPA in the United States.
<p></p>
"The announcement by Senator Schumer is more good news for parents and for
everyone who cares about public health," said Wiles. "Legislation to ban BPA
from commerce would be a significant first step to a fundamental overhaul of
the nation¹s federal regulatory process of the chemical industry."
