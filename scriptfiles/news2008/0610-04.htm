WASHINGTON, DC - June 10 - Today the American Civil Liberties Union commended the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for delaying a vote on a proposed requirement for “family-friendly” filters as a condition for granting a license for the 2155-2175 MHz band. In comments filed with the FCC, the ACLU called the proposed filter an unconstitutional attempt by the government to impose mandatory regulations on the Internet and the organization urges the commissioners to reject an automatic filter during their July meeting.

“The power to control what children see rightfully belongs with the parents, not government,” said Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. “The proposed rule gives a heckler’s veto to communities with the most restrictive standards.  It is government censorship masquerading as a ‘family-friendly’ filter. The commission needs to avoid setting filtering conditions on licensees in the broadband spectrum.”
  <P></P>
“The Internet must remain content neutral and free of government and corporate gatekeepers,” said James Tucker, ACLU Policy Counsel. “This is no way to close the digital divide.”
  <P></P>
Tucker described the filtering requirement as “a paternalistic effort to parent the parents through a mandatory filter. If approved, this filter will close and censor a segment of the wireless broadcast spectrum. The proposal would only allow paying subscribers to disable the filter if they agree to give up their privacy and anonymity. Adults, including the poor, who use the proposed ‘free’ broadband service would be denied uncensored content altogether.”
 <P></P>
The ACLU has a long history of fighting against censorship and for neutrality. Over the last two decades, the ACLU has been a participant in nearly all of the Internet censorship and neutrality cases that have been decided by the United States Supreme Court, including Reno v. ACLU, Ashcroft v. ACLU, Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition and the Brand X decisions.<!-- #EndEditable -->
