<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 4 - Volunteers and staff of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, will gather on Capitol Hill on Thursday, March 6, to lobby their senators and representatives to promote equality and civil rights of GLBT Americans.
 <P></P>
“This is an opportunity for GLBT people from across the country to engage their members of Congress and speak out on the issues critical to our community,” said Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese.  “Whether it be calling for the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ educating on HIV/AIDS, or working to prevent discrimination in the workplace based on gender identity and sexual orientation, GLBT constituents will have their opportunity to be heard.”
  <P></P>
The volunteers will share their experiences to help put a face to the issues of discrimination and the need for equality.  The volunteers’ visits to Capitol Hill are a part of the Human Rights Campaign’s ongoing effort to pass fair-minded policies for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.
  <P></P>
Members of the media seeking to arrange on-site interviews with volunteers or the HRC legislative team, please contact Trevor Thomas at 202.216.1547 or <a href="mailto:Trevor.Thomas@hrc.org">Trevor.Thomas@hrc.org</a>.
   <P></P>
The Human Rights Campaign is America’s largest civil rights organization working to achieve gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender equality. By inspiring and engaging all Americans, HRC strives to end discrimination against GLBT citizens and realize a nation that achieves fundamental fairness and equality for all.<!-- #EndEditable -->
