May 22 - After the Colombian military illegally attacked a FARC camp in Ecuador in March with US assistance, the Uribe government claimed to have found laptops belonging to the rebels that they say show clear ties between the FARC, Venezuela and Ecuador. The Colombian government handed these laptops to Interpol for verification, but what did Interpol really find?
<p></p>
The Interpol report released March 15 indicates that the Colombian government had direct access to the contents of the laptops for 48 hours, and that Interpol "didn't evaluate the accuracy or the source" of the documents. The only source claiming the files have not been tampered with is Colombia. Yet the US media has gone ahead and indicted Chavez in what Forrest Hylton calls a "propaganda war on Chavez and the Venezuelan government taken to a new level in terms of being a really systematic international disinformation campaign".
<p></p>
"Colombia's violation of Equadorian sovereignty was one of the gravest breaches of diplomacy in the hemisphere in some time", and the US government and media's fingerprints are all over it. Even presidential candidates McCain, Clinton, and Obama have stood behind Bush and Uribe.
