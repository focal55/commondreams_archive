 - June 24 - Netroots Nation organizers announced today that the <a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/agenda-2008" target="_new">agenda</a> and <a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/speakers-2008" target="_new">speaker</a> list for the third annual gathering of the Netroots is online. The convention will be held July 17-20, at the Austin Convention Center in Austin, TX.
<P></P>
The convention schedule will include nearly 50 panels and 20 roundtable discussions on topics such as:
<P></P><ul>
• The Next President and the Law
<br>
• The Future of the Netroots and U.S. House Campaigns
<br>
• The Races We Aren't Watching but Should
<br>
• How to Stop Voter Suppression
<br>
• Iraq in Strategic Context
</ul><P></P>
After asking community members to submit ideas for panels in order to accurately reflect issues that are most important to them, organizers say they received more than 140 submissions on topics ranging from the environment to Iraq. Those ideas were culled down to create an agenda that organizers say "mixes established Netroots experts with fresh, new voices in the progressive world."
<P></P>
Confimed panelists include Darcy Burner, Paul Krugman, Markos Moulitsas, Heather "Digby" Parton, John Dean, Van Jones, Brad Miller, Cheryl Contee, Rick Perlstein, Debra Bowen, Rick Noriega, Pam Spaulding, Greg Mitchell, Alex Gibney, Jerome Guillet and Andrea Batista Schlesinger.
<P></P>
Confirmed keynote speakers include Gov. Howard Dean, Lawrence Lessig and Van Jones. Additional announcements are forthcoming.
<P></P>
<a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/" target="_new">Netroots Nation</a> rebranded in August of 2007 in an effort to more accurately reflect the makeup of its audience and mission of implementing programs that teach and empower Netroots communities to affect change in the public sphere. The 2007 gathering last August included a Presidential Leadership Forum that drew seven of the eight Democratic candidates.
