WASHINGTON, DC - May 15 - The Supreme Court of California today ruled that the state Constitution requires that all citizens be allowed equal marriage rights.  People For the American Way Foundation President Kathryn Kolbert issued the following statement.

 
<P></P>
“This is a proud day for all Californians.  No one should be excluded from marriage simply because they are gay or lesbian.  Giving all people the freedom to marry is the American way.

 <P></P>

“Marriage is about committed couples who want to take care of each other for the rest of their lives.  I know that the citizens of California want to do right by their neighbors and by their communities, and today the Court has certainly done that.”

 <P></P>

People For the American Way Foundation filed an amicus brief in the case.  In coming months, People For will mobilize its tens of thousands of California members to oppose the anti-marriage equality initiative whose signatures are now being reviewed by the secretary of state’s office.<!-- #EndEditable -->
