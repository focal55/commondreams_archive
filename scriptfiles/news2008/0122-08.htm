<p>WASHINGTON - January 22 - Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA, issued the following remarks in response to today's sentencing of Jose Padilla to 17 years and 4 months for terrorism conspiracy charges:
 <P></P>
"While the Bush administration hailed Jose Padilla's conviction as a victory in the 'war on terror,' Mr. Padilla was denied his fundamental rights.  Regardless of the verdict, accountability for Mr. Padilla's three and a half years of detention without charge or trial or allegations of torture and ill-treatment still has not been addressed.  
 <P></P>
"Amnesty International believes that there are troubling questions surrounding the fairness of Mr. Padilla's trial including the presumption of innocence, the right to a speedy trial and the defendant's effective ability to assist in his defense.
 <P></P>
"The U.S. government and others claim that Mr. Padilla's conviction is proof that prosecutions for terrorist-related crimes can be successfully pursued in the ordinary federal courts. While Amnesty International fully supports this notion in principle, the organization remains unconvinced that justice was done or seen to be done in this case."
