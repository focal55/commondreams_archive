<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 21 - As President Bush returns
to the United States from his whirlwind tour of Africa, Africa Action
notes with concern that coverage of Bush’s trip has concentrated on
particular successes in individual countries while ignoring the
systemic, continent-wide development challenges that unjust U.S.
economic policies continue to promote.
<P></P>
Most of the attention around the Bush visit has focused on U.S. public
health programs in Africa, particularly the President’s Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  Although Bush claims to have asked for a
doubling of the U.S. commitment on AIDS to $30 billion over the next
five years, the President’s actual budget proposal for the next fiscal
year would provide no increase in annual HIV/AIDS funding over current
levels, and includes a 40 % decrease in U.S. contributions to the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
<P></P>
“In order for the success stories he saw last week to be replicated
across Africa, President Bush should do his best to ensure that future
U.S policies support widespread systemic changes in U.S.-Africa
relations,” said Michael Swigert, Africa Action’s Program Associate for
Policy Analysis and Communications.  “This means fully funding the fight
against HIV/AIDS and removing the ideological limitations in PEPFAR that
undermine the program’s effectiveness. The U.S. should cancel the
foreign debt of African countries so that aid money is no longer trapped
in a useless cycle of debt payments rather than funding the social and
economic programs it was intended for. President Bush witnessed
firsthand the positive impacts of debt cancellation in Tanzania.  As
long as other African countries remain bound by the chains of debt,
similar gains across the continent will be difficult.”
<P></P>
In an effort to promote the concept of his legacy as a “compassionate
conservative,” Bush’s visit highlighted successful U.S. aid programs
while failing to give adequate attention to the serious conflicts in
Africa where further U.S. diplomatic pressure is needed. President Bush
can claim a real diplomatic success in the U.S-brokered 2005 peace
agreement that ended Sudan’s decades-long North-South civil war, but
despite his strident rhetoric condemning the genocide in Darfur, the
reality for civilians on the ground there remains as perilous as ever,
and international neglect has allowed the North-South peace to come
under threat of collapse.
<P></P>
“Beyond giving aid, the U.S. needs to be a global good neighbor, using
the full force of its international leverage to finally end the genocide
in Darfur, support peace negotiations in the Great Lakes region and
negotiate a just resolution to Kenya’s political crisis through
multilateral engagement,” said Gerald LeMelle, Executive Director of
Africa Action.
<P></P>
One Bush program that threatens such an approach is the new unified
command for U.S. military operations in Africa known as AFRICOM.
<P></P>
“Even though the Bush administration recently announced that AFRICOM
will continue to base its operations in Germany rather than in Africa,
by its very nature, this aggressive initiative threatens successful
U.S.-African partnerships for development and democracy.” said Mr.
LeMelle. “Contrary to the altruistic rhetoric Bush used to describe the
program during his visit, AFRICOM is driven by U.S. interests in
preserving access to African resources and operating freely in the
global “war on terror” at the expense of Africa’s people. This is
evidenced by the fact that neither African governments nor the United
Nations were consulted on the announcement of AFRICOM. Widespread
cheerleading for U.S. development initiatives should not dupe the public
into ignoring the militarization of U.S. foreign policy toward Africa.”
