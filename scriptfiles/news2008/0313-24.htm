<p>PORTLAND, OR - March 13 - National polls indicate that young voter turnout is anticipated to reach an all time high this election year. This movement among 18-25 year olds is evident in the poster submissions for the national political poster competition, Art of Politics 2008. The contest is open to all ages- entrants have ranged from 5 to 70 years old – but the creators of the Art of Politics make it very clear they are targeting youth artists and activists. “We’re creating a venue to give young people – not just those of voting age – a voice to express what matters to them. Our hope is that this will encourage them to remain active in politics and the political issues that resonate most with them.”

 <P></P>

The efforts are paying off. Of the 46 posters submitted in the first six weeks, nearly half came from entrants under the age of thirty. Their messages range from frustration with the current administration, protest against the war, the health care system and voter advocacy.  And submissions have come in from all over the country; from Florida, Washington, Colorado, Maryland, Arizona and Oregon, to name a few, artists from all over the country are getting involved and voicing their opinions.

 
<P></P>
Since launching in mid-January, Art of Politics 2008 has attracted thousands of visitors to their website as new posters go up on a weekly basis. Organizers expect the bulk of the posters to come in April, the final month for submissions. “We’re really impressed with the quality and diversity of work coming in. The issues reflected in the posters are all over the map.”

 <P></P>

At the end of April, after the all submissions have been posted to the Art of Politics website, the posters will be voted on by the general public. During the entire month of May, an online People’s Choice voting will take place. The top thirty winners of the People’s Choice round will go before a panel of judges who will select the final three winners. The top thirty posters will then be on display throughout the country until the election in November.

 
<P></P>
Creating a highly collaborative intersection of artists, voters, media and activists, Art of Politics 2008 is currently working on partnership opportunities and media relations. To get involved, please visit the website or contact Summer or Leslie directly.<!-- #EndEditable -->
