WASHINGTON, DC - June 9 - Bangladesh is still recovering from last year's Cycle Sidr and subsequent floods. This year, Bangladesh is reporting a 2 to 3 million ton rice shortage. The country is now facing a food crisis compounded by climate change and environmental decline.
<P></P>
An increasing number of floods and cyclones as well as rising temperatures are a big threat to food security of Bangladesh. Extreme weather conditions such as these cause declines in the yields of wheat, potato and rice, and clean drinking water. The number of expected floods and cyclones rose from once in 20 to 100 years to once a decade. Environmental advocate and filmmaker Afsan Chowdhury comments that, "The environment is now determining how much food access you will have." He also adds that Bangladeshis today are paying almost double for a kilogram of rice than last year, and spending around 70 percent of their income on food.
<P></P>
The food crisis did not happen overnight. It is the result of negligence by governments worldwide, who have ignored agricultural food policies and calls for food reserves for 40 years.
<P></P>
This week, Bangladesh is attending the international food conference in Rome and asking the international community for help. One of the proposed suggestions is a global contingency food reserve to protect the poorest countries when shortages occur.
