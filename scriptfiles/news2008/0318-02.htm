<p>NEW YORK - March 18 - Tomorrow, March 19, a number of activist
 organizations committed to peace and progress will stage a nonviolent
 blockade at the national headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service
 in Washington, D.C. The action is part of a day of protests on the
 fifth anniversary of the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.
<P></P>
 Participants will assemble at McPherson Square (15th Street. N.W. and
 K Street, N.W.) at 7 am, before marching -- with the Rude Mechanical
 Orchestra -- on the IRS (1111 Constitution Ave., N.W.). The blockade
 is set to begin at 8 am. Some demonstrators will block access to the
 IRS building while others will pass out flyers explaining the intent
 of the action. Signs, banners and props will be utilized to
 illustrate the disparity between war spending and the needs of an
 economy crippled by five years of war.
<P></P>
 "Just as military recruiters supply bodies for the war, the IRS
 supplies the funding," stated New York City WRL organizer Ed
 Hedemann. "So, I'm doing my part in disrupting that relentless flow
 of money by standing in front of the IRS entrance and by refusing to
 send my taxes to the IRS."
<P></P>
 More than 20 organizations are sponsoring the event, including: the
 War Resisters League, Code Pink, United for Peace & Justice, Movement
 for a Democratic Society, Ground Zero for Peace, Granny Peace
 Brigade, and the Socialist Party USA. Members of the participating
 organizations feel the need to engage in civil disobedience in order
 to dramatize their vigorous opposition to United States government's
 wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and President George W. Bush's "global war
 on terror."
<P></P>
 Ruth Benn, long-time War Resisters League activist, argues "The
 bloodshed has already cost the lives of thousands of Americans,
 Iraqis, Afghanis, and others, and is hemorrhaging vast sums of money
 vitally needed to improve lives in this country and abroad. At the
 same time half the people in the U.S. feel less safe while the
 government has ignored calls from experts and activists for a foreign
 policy that rejects war."
<P></P>
 The blockade is part of a full day of creative, nonviolent actions
 and civil disobedience in Washington, D.C., and across the country.
 The protests are being coordinated by United for Peace and Justice in
 an effort to disrupt the business of war as usual. The actions will
 focus on the "pillars of war" -- the military, war funding, war
 profiteering, the security state, and the mainstream media. Civil
 disobedience participants will have undergone special trainings in nonviolence.
<P></P>
 The War Resisters League is an 85-year-old secular pacifist
 organization, headquartered in New York City, and is affiliated with
 the War Resisters' International, which is based in London. WRL
 believes war to be a crime against humanity, and advocates Gandhian
 nonviolence as the method for creating a democratic society free of
 war, racism, sexism, and human exploitation.
