WASHINGTON - July 10 - At a time when gas prices are soaring, jobs are being lost, wages are stagnating, and hard working American families are struggling to get by, Walmart announced that its sales for June are up 5.8% from last year. It's just another reminder that what's good for Wal-Mart is bad for America, something its Chief Financial Officer as much as admitted when he said "tough times are actually a good time for Wal-Mart." While Walmart is no doubt celebrating its increased sales and the billions it will rake in this year, the rest of the country is struggling to get by. Instead of celebrating, Wal-Mart should make real changes to support its workers that would make our country, and our economy, stronger.<!-- #EndEditable -->
