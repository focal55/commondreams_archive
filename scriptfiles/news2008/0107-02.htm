<p>WASHINGTON - January 7 - Today, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Baze v. Rees, the Constitution Project welcomed legal deliberations on the most commonly used method of execution in the United States.

 
<P></P>
Virginia Sloan, president of the Constitution Project, said, "As a result of the Baze case, the Supreme Court has effectively imposed a nationwide moratorium on capital punishment, and has spurred a much-needed national debate about the death penalty itself."
<P></P>
 

Baze will be the first case since 1878 in which the Court has examined the constitutionality of a specific method of capital punishment. The case was brought by two Kentucky death row inmates who argue that a state violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when its execution procedures create a significant and unnecessary risk of inflicting severe pain that could be prevented by the adoption of reasonable safeguards.

 <P></P>

The Constitution Project's bipartisan Death Penalty Committee has issued "Mandatory Justice: The Death Penalty Revisited," a report finding that our country's capital punishment systems create a profound risk of convicting and even executing the wrong people.  The report contains recommendations for a series of urgently-needed reforms.
