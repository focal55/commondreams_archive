WASHINGTON, DC - May 23 - <br>
<br>
<strong>Who:</strong>   Veterans For Peace, a national organization of military veterans including men and women spanning the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), World War II, the Korean, Vietnam, the Gulf, and current Iraq wars, as well as other conflicts cold and hot.
<p></p>
<strong>What:</strong>  Memorials, vigils, solemn programs and parades
<p></p>
<strong>Why:</strong>  To remember the fallen and educate the public about the human cost of war.
<p></p>
Across the nation, veterans, military families and friends will gather on Monday, May 26, 2008 to remember fallen loved ones, comrades and all service members who have died. Veterans For Peace will commemorate these women and men with vigils and solemn programs. Several chapters will display temporary cemeteries to represent the over 3400 fallen in the current conflict in Iraq. Other chapters will lay wreaths, flowers; have speakers, readings and march in parades.
<p></p>
Veterans For Peace National Executive Director stated, "As veterans this day holds special meaning. Many of our membership have seen their buddies die in battle and we all know that only luck or grace allows us to be here today. As Gene Glazer, a World War II medic and Veterans For Peace former VFP board who passed last year once told me, 'There is no better way to remember the dead than to defend the living.' We have a responsibility to educate the public on the human cost of war, the lives shattered, broken and lost. We stand as witnesses to this terrible cost and we say to the people of the world, to honor the dead we must find ways to live with each other. We must study war no more"
<p></p>
Veterans For Peace National President Elliott Adams comments, "While Memorial Day is a special day to remember our service members, we must not forget to remember all those who have died as a result of war. Sacrifices and tragedies are faced by all who experience the absurdity of war. We must remember everyone and in their memory we must struggle to abolish war so that instead of mourning on this day we can celebrate a victory for the power of the human spirit."

<em>Founded in 1985, Veterans For Peace is a national organization of men and women veterans of all eras and duty stations spanning the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), World War II, the Korean, Vietnam, Gulf and current Iraq wars as well as other conflicts cold or hot. It has chapters in nearly every state in the union and is headquartered in St. Louis, MO. Our collective experience tells us wars are easy to start and hard to stop and that those hurt are often the innocent. Thus, other means of problem solving are necessary. Veterans For Peace is an official Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) represented at the U.N.</em><!-- #EndEditable -->
