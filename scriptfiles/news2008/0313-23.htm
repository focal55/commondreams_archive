<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 13 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) released the following statement after learning of the death last night of his dear friend, Senator Howard Metzenbaum:<br>
<br>
“I am deeply saddened by the passing of Senator Metzenbaum. Howard was a close friend to me and a great asset to this country. I valued greatly my relationship with him; I turned to him frequently for advice and inspiration.<br>
<br>
“His steadfast support for consumer rights and worker protections, as well as his commitment to protecting the working class in this country, still serves as constant motivation for me in my service to my constituents.<br>
<br>
“Howard will be remembered as a savvy businessman and staunch advocate for Ohio’s working men and women. From parking lots to newspapers and airports his investments secured his legacy in Ohio as both an iron-willed businessman and politician. He was a fearless opponent of all things related to special interests--if a bill did not have the best interest of workers and consumers in mind, it would not budge in the Senate.<br>
<br>
“Howard was one of the greatest senators to serve this country. Ohio was very fortunate to be the beneficiaries of Howard’s service, and I was very fortunate to be the recipient of his wisdom and guidance. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
