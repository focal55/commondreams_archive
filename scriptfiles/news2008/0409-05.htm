<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 9 - Late yesterday the two top investigators from the House
Committee with oversight of FDA threatened subpoenas if information
detailing FDA's decision allowing the toxic chemical BPA in infant formula
and other foods was not turned over to the Committee.
<p></p>
In a letter to FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, MD, Reps. John
Dingell (D-MI) and Bart Stupak (D-MI) ­ the House Energy and Commerce
Committee chair and its Investigations Subcommittee chair ­ demanded FDA
provide information on why it ignored voluminous independent, peer-reviewed
studies finding cause for concern over exposure to BPA, and instead used
just two reports funded by the plastics industry when it claimed the
chemical posed no risk to infants.

'..it appears that the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) position on
BPA's safety is entirely dependent on two studies, both of which are funded
by the American Plastics Council, and one of which has not been published or
peer-reviewed.  Given that there are dozens of published, peer-reviewed
studies related to BPA, your development of critical public health policy in
this manner, especially as related to infants and children, seems highly
questionable,' wrote the lawmakers.
<p></p>
'Once again, the FDA is doing favors for industry instead of protecting the
public health,' said Richard Wiles, Executive Director of Environmental
Working Group. 'Based on the agency's own responses, it appears that the FDA
has ignored solid scientific research on BPA risks in favor of the chemical
industry's position that this toxic chemical is somehow safe for babies.
They must be held to account,' Wiles added.
<p></p>
