DENVER - July 23 - On July 22, former U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate John Edwards and ACORN members encouraged Colorado legislators to restore and fully fund the state's Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a way to cut poverty. Edwards also announced anti-poverty plans with ACORN members in Los Angeles and Connecticut on his "Half in Ten" campaign tour.
<p></p>
"As a single, working mother, I know first-hand what it's like to struggle to afford the life my children, myself, and all Coloradans deserve," said ACORN member Linda Medlock.  "After my divorce, times became very hard to meet the everyday needs of my children.  However, after I received the federal and Colorado Earned Income Tax Credit, my financial struggles became less burdensome.  It was a lifesaver in terms of helping me provide the things I needed for my kids until I was making enough money to make ends meet on my own."
<p></p>
The EITC is one of the key steps outlined in Edwards' plan to reduce poverty by 50 percent within a decade. Edwards is touring the United States as chairman of "Half in Ten," an initiative of ACORN, the Center for American Progress Action Fund (CAPAF), the Coalition on Human Needs (CHN), and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR).
<p></p>
On July 21, Edwards joined Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in announcing a $100 million affordable housing fund. The New Generation Fund is designed to combat homelessness and reduce the housing burden on poor and working families by offering affordable housing developers early-stage financing for properties intended for low- and moderate-income residents.
<p></p>
Los Angeles ACORN members facing foreclosure, eviction, sky-high rents and source of income discrimination testified at the press conference with Edwards.
<p></p>
"Half in Ten is about working together on a real plan to reduce and eliminate poverty in communities all across the country," said ACORN member and single mother Donna Rodriguez, who pays 50 percent of her income in rent. "Today we highlighted a huge piece of the puzzle - the housing crisis - and announced one concrete step that will have a big local impact in providing new affordable housing."
<p></p>
In Hartford on July 10, Edwards said that Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell was "wrong" to veto a raise in that state's minimum wage after meeting with ACORN members. Raising both state and federal minimum wages is another key step in the Half in Ten campaign.
<p></p>
Minimum wage hikes have been shown to boost state and local economies, Edwards said.
<p></p>
In Bridgeport, Conn., later that day, Edwards supported ACORN members' pleas for more affordable housing. Later, Bridgeport City Council members signed an ACORN pledge committing to pass an ordinance that would create jobs, a living wage, and inclusionary zoning in the city.<!-- #EndEditable -->
