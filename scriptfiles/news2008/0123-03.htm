<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 23 - Friends of the Earth Action has begun airing <a href="http://www.foe.org/FoE-Action/Ready.mp3" target="_new">radio</a> and other ads in South Carolina designed to get voters to consider candidates' positions on nuclear power in advance of the upcoming Democratic presidential primary in the state.

 <p></p>

"South Carolina has historically been a dumping ground for much of the country's nuclear waste, and if nuclear power use in the U.S. is expanded, it could exacerbate this trend," said Tom Clements, Friends of the Earth Action's Southeast Regional Nuclear Coordinator, based in Columbia, South Carolina. "There's a lot riding on this election. President Bush wants to start reprocessing vast amounts of high-level waste in South Carolina. Were will the next president come down on this dirty and dangerous process? Just like Nevada voters, we are tired of having nuclear waste dumped on us and we deserve to hear where the candidates stand.”
 <p></p>
 

Friends of the Earth Action's radio ad began airing statewide over the weekend. "Are you ready for more nuclear waste to be dumped in South Carolina?" the ad asks, informing voters of what will likely happen if nuclear power is expanded in the U.S.  South Carolina is currently the recipient of much of the so-called "low level" nuclear waste from around the country. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership proposed by President Bush could end up directing substantial amounts of high-level waste (spent nuclear fuel) into the state as well, turning the Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site into the main reprocessing center.

  <p></p>

In addition to radio advertising, Friends of the Earth Action has taken out a full page ad in The State, and will be running banner ads on websites visited by South Carolinians. This is part of a broader campaign to prevent a resurgence of nuclear power in the U.S. while promoting clean alternatives and energy conservation. No new nuclear plants have come online in the country for decades but President Bush and Congress just approved $20.5 billion in loan guarantees to subsidize new reactor construction.

  <p></p>

Friends of the Earth Action has endorsed John Edwards for president, in part because of his opposition to new nuclear power. Edwards was also the first candidate to come out with a strong global warming plan and he has been the most vocal in speaking out against excessive corporate power, which often leads to environmental degradation.
