<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 27 - The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to hear testimony today regarding legislation to amend the False Claims Act ("FCA"), an anti-fraud law which has been responsible for the recovery of tens of billions of dollars for the United States government. The hearing will take place at 10:00AM in Room 226 of the Senate Dirksen Office Building. (<a href="http://capwiz.com/whistleblowers/utr/1/GEOBIDNOHF/OENVIDPAJE/1770633471" target="_new">Blog post and link to official notice here</a> )
<p></p>
The False Claims Correction Act of 2007 is designed to sure up the law, which has been weakened by court decisions over the past several years. These decisions have made it easier for government contractors to escape liability under the FCA.
<p></p>
Stephen M. Kohn, the President of the National Whistleblower Center, submitted written testimony in support of the Correction Act (available <a href="http://capwiz.com/whistleblowers/utr/1/GEOBIDNOHF/CKABIDPAJF/1770633471" target="_new">here</a> in PDF). In part, Kohn said:
<p></p>
    <i>"The Correction Act is essential legislation for protecting the integrity of procurement and
    contracting process. It is narrowly designed to correct a number of judicial interpretations which
    undermined the original intent of the False Claims Act."</i><br>
<br>
Since 1988 the NWC has championed whistleblower protection. The NWC is currently supporting FBI Whistleblower Bassem Youssef, who has reported serious misconduct in the War on Terror, and the NWC is currently assisting Bunnatine Greenhouse (the former Army Corps of Engineers top contracting officer who opposed the no-bid multi billion dollar contracts awarded to Halliburton for the reconstruction of Iraq)
