<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 9 -  Jewish Voice for Peace and Just Foreign Policy have presented former U.S. President Jimmy Carter with a petition signed by 5,000 of their members supporting his meeting with Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal. The petition is being delivered to the three remaining Democratic and Republican presidential candidates this week. 
<p></p>
"In a joint effort, our two organizations have collected signatures to this petition over the last several weeks. ... Please accept this as an expression of appreciation for your recent efforts toward creating a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians and as encouragement for you to continue despite the criticism from many sectors. Peace demands courage," the groups said in a letter delivered to President Carter on Thursday.
<p></p>
The text of the petition reads: "I support peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Jimmy Carter speaks for me when he says that resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires talking to Hamas.  64% of Israelis have said they support talks with Hamas. Please support including talks with Hamas in efforts to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians."
<p></p>
"I am grateful for the efforts of Jewish Voice for Peace, Just Foreign Policy and others working for the cause of peace in the Middle East. Public dialogue and awareness are crucial to achieving the goals of peace with security for Israel and peace with justice for Palestinians," said President Carter.
<p></p>
The petition was signed by 5,000 individuals from all 50 states. A copy of the petition can be found on-line at:<a href="http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/mideastpetition.pdf" target="_new"> www.justforeignpolicy.org/mideastpetition.pdf</a>.
