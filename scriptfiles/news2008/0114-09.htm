<p>MIAMI - January 14 - <br>
  <br>
  <strong>When:</strong> Monday January 14th, 12 noon<br>
  <strong>Where:</strong> Miami Office of Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen 8660 West
Flagler Street, Suite 131
<P></P>
CODEPINK: Women for Peace condemns the violent climate in Miami
perpetrated by certain sectors of the community and calls on Cong.
Ros-Lehtinen to denounce violence and attacks against those with
differing viewpoints.
<P></P>
On Saturday, January 12, six CODEPINK members peacefully tried to
gather signatures calling on the FBI to arrest a known terrorist, Luis
Posada Carriles, who is living freely in Miami. Before the women could
even park their vehicle outside the Versailles Restaurant, they were
attacked by a violent mob. The FBI and Miami- Dade police, despite
previous guarantees, failed to provide the group with protection.
<P></P>
"Miami is supposed to be part of the United States, not a city of
anarchy controlled by violent mobs," says CODEPINK member Tighe Barry,
who was driving the CODEPINK vehicle when it was attacked while police
stood by.
<P></P>
The group wants to discuss the Congresswoman's involvement in the
release from Panamanian jails of four persons involved in terrorist
acts, in particular Jose Posada Carriles, a known terrorist who
entered our country illegally and who is living openly in the Miami
area.  They also are very concerned that she tried to prevent FBI
investigators from going to Cuba to obtain further information
concerning Posada Carriles' involvement in hotel bombings in Havana in
1997 that left an Italian tourist dead .
<P></P>
The group also wants to discuss the attack on their free speech
rights. They claim that the Miami police, FBI, and elected officials
are all colluding with the most undemocratic elements of the community
who condone terrorist acts against civilians—as reflected by their
support for Posada Carriles—and have no respect for free speech and
free assembly. "We will ask the Congresswoman to condemn attacks
against those who question why known terrorists are living openly in
her city," says CODEPINK cofounder Medea Benjamin, who received death
threats after she denounced Posada Carriles on the Miami-based TV show
Arrebatados. "We intend to return to Miami in the future to pursue
this campaign and we want to be assured that this time, our safety
will be protected."
<P></P>
The group will also go at 9am to the Miami FBI office (16320 Northwest
2nd Avenue, North Miami Beach) to question the FBI about why they
destroyed evidence pertaining to the Carriles case. They will also
drop off signed cards asking the FBI to put Posada Carriles on the
Most Wanted List and for our government to arrest or extradite this
dangerous man to Venezuela, where he is a wanted on 73 counts of first
degree murder for the bombing of a civilian airliner.
