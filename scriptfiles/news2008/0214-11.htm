<p>LAKEWOOD, OHIO - February 14 -  On Tuesday, Congressman Dennis Kucinich met with the District Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers to press the case for urgent action to control flooding on the Cuyahoga River. In particular, he expressed concern over the vulnerability of the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District Southerly wastewater treatment plant to flooding.<br>

<br>
Congressman Kucinich also sent a letter yesterday to Lieutenant General Robert Van Antwerp, the Commander and Chief of Engineers at the Army Corps of Engineers. The letter outlined the urgency of fully funding the ongoing efforts to find solutions. <br>
<br>
“There is a lot at stake -- jobs, property values, public health, and water quality,” said Kucinich. “This community needs help and needs it now.”<br>
<br>
Tuesday’s meeting followed a meeting organized by Congressman Kucinich on Monday in Lakewood. There, representatives of business owners as well as local, state, and federal government discussed ongoing flooding problems in low-lying areas in the Cuyahoga River Basin.<br>
<br>
“There are several ideas about how to remedy the flooding, which is a good thing,” said Kucinich. “But we need to know that one solution won’t create problems in other areas. We need to step back and make sure we’re looking at the big picture. That’s why we need the Army Corps to conduct a thorough study. Whatever the solution, it needs to be done quickly.”<br>
<br>
Congressman Kucinich called on the Army Corps of Engineers to help determine an approach that would be timely, lasting, and equitable. The Army Corps was receptive to his concerns and pledged to continue to work with him as they have since 2006 when Congressman Kucinich first contacted the Army Corps.<br>
<br>
The text of the letter sent to Lieutenant General Van Antwerp is below:<br>

<br>
February 13, 2008<br>

Lieutenant General Robert Van Antwerp<br>
Commander and Chief of Engineers<br>
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br>
441 G Street, NW<br>
Washington, D.C. 20314-1000<br>
<br>
I am writing to thank the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for its work to date on the Section 205 studies for the City of Independence and the Villages of Brooklyn Heights, Valley View, and Walton Hills in Ohio’s 10th Congressional District, and to request continued funding for these studies to evaluate alternative measures which would reduce damages associated with flooding.&nbsp; To date, the continuing authorities program for Section 205 for Fiscal Year 2008 has not been allocated.&nbsp; Continued and timely funding for the Army Corps Section 205 studies in my district is imperative for public health and safety due to the proximity of the flood areas to our regional sewage treatment plant and to prevent further damages to residents and businesses.<br>

<br>
As you may know, these communities have experienced severe flooding in recent years.&nbsp; The 2006 floods caused devastation to homes and businesses.&nbsp; The area was declared an emergency at both the state and federal levels.&nbsp; While some help was provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration, a long-term strategy is needed.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In 2006 I asked for the Army Corps’s assistance.&nbsp; Each of these communities requested a Section 205 Flood Control Study.&nbsp; Because of the urgency of this problem, the feasibility phase of the study was done despite a moratorium on funding at that time.&nbsp; The results of the feasibility phase show that Independence and Valley View are eligible for the Feasibility Cost Share Agreement phase of the study while we are still awaiting results for Brooklyn Heights and Walton Hills.&nbsp; Since that time, the area has experienced flooding in January 2007 and just last week on February 5 and 6, 2008.&nbsp; Again, much damage has been done.&nbsp; With increasing amounts of development upstream from these communities, it is likely that the situation will get worse.&nbsp; <br>

<br>
It is urgent that these studies are completed in a timely manner and that full funding is made available.&nbsp; The confluence of West Creek and the Cuyahoga River is just upstream from the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District’s Southerly treatment plant which serves the sewage treatment needs for the region.&nbsp; Failure on the part of the Army Corps to follow through in a timely manner on the Section 205 studies for these communities could result in a public health and safety catastrophe for the region.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I understand that up to $2 million in federal funding is authorized for the completion of this study.&nbsp; Approximately $1 million will be needed for each of the 4 communities:&nbsp; Brooklyn Heights, Independence, Valley View, and Walton Hills, for a total of $4 million.&nbsp; With the 50-50 cost share requirement under Section 205, the federal share will be approximately $2 million.&nbsp; The Army Corps must treat this matter as a priority due to the public health and safety risks and the increasing volume and severity of the flooding experienced by these communities.&nbsp; I urge you to make full funding available for the continuation of this project for FY 2008.<br>

<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Dennis J. Kucinich<br>
Member of Congress<br>
