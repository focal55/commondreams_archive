<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 9 -  During coverage of the 2004
election cycle, both <em>The Washington Post</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> published editorials
calling on Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Democratic presidential nominee Sen.
John Kerry, to release her tax returns. To date,
neither publication has called on Cindy McCain, wife of presumptive 2008
Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, to do the same. Today, <em>Media Matter for America</em> released letters
sent to the editorial boards of both papers calling on the publications to
explain their lack of consistency.</p>

<p> <strong>Excerpts from the letter to <em>The Washington Post</em>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On
May 4, 2004, <em>The Washington Post</em>
printed an editorial headlined 'Teresa Heinz Kerry's Taxes.' In
this editorial, the <em>Post</em> called
for Sen. John Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, to 'make her tax
returns public' in the interest of transparency. From the beginning of
this year to the date of this letter, the <em>Post</em>

editorial board has not made the same request for the release of Cindy
McCain's tax returns or even noted that Sen. John McCain's campaign
has refused to release such documents."</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>"Given the significantly limited information
released by the McCain campaign, why has the <em>Post</em>
failed to call for Cindy McCain to make her full returns public, as it did with
Heinz Kerry? In 2004, the <em>Post</em>
lamented that the information released by Heinz Kerry was "short of what
ought to be done." But when it comes to Cindy McCain -- who has released
even less information than Heinz Kerry -- the <em>Post</em>
has chosen to remain silent."</p>

<p>"We call on you today to explain your lack of
consistency on this important issue or risk tarnishing your journalistic
credibility and integrity not just with your readers but with the broader
American public as well."</p></blockquote>

<p> <strong>Excerpts from the letter to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p> "On July 1, 2004, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> printed an
editorial headlined 'Kerry and Disclosure,' which called for Sen.
John Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, to 'release her full filings
with the IRS' in order to be 'as transparent as possible with the
American public.' From the beginning of this year to the date of this
letter, the <em>Journal</em> editorial
board has not made the same request for the release of Cindy McCain's tax
returns or even noted that Sen. John McCain's campaign has refused to
release such documents."</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>"Given
the significantly limited information released by the McCain campaign, why has
the <em>Journal </em>failed to call for
Cindy McCain to make her full returns public, as it did with Heinz Kerry? As
the <em>Journal </em>stated in 2004,
'Choosing to lead a public life means accepting the need for financial
transparency.' Are we to assume by the <em>Journal's</em>
omission that the McCains are excused from that same obligation?"</p>

<p>"We
call on you today to explain your lack of consistency on this important issue
or risk tarnishing your journalistic credibility and integrity not just with
your readers but with the broader American public as well."</p>
