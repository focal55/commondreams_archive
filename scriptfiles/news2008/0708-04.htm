  TORONTO - July 8 - Canada's refugee board has been ordered by a judge to rehear an application by a US war deserter to remain in Canada. Federal court justice Robert Barnes said that Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board made mistakes when they turned down Joshua Key's claim for asylum.
<p></p>
In 2003, Key served eight months in Iraq as a combat engineer. On his return to the US on leave, he and his wife, along with their four young children moved to Canada to seek refuge. In 2007, Key co-authored a book "The Deserter's Tale" about his experiences in Iraq.
<p></p>
Key's lawyer, Jeffry House, told The Real News Network that "the refugee board found that Joshua Key was required on a systematic basis as a soldier to violate the Geneva conventions." That decision would have led to refugee status, but the board ruled that it wasn't sufficient, and that Key must also show that he was required to commit war crimes.
<p></p>
On June 3rd, the Canadian Government passed a non-binding resolution calling for deserters to be allowed to stay and to put a halt to deportations. To date, Conservative Prime Minister Steven Harper, who is a close ally to US President George Bush, has ignored the resolution.
<p></p>
Sgt. Corey Glass, another US war deserter, is due to be removed from Canada later this week and he has made an Internet appeal to Prime Minister Harper. "I left the US because of my opposition to the Iraq war. If I'm returned to the US, I could face court marshal, jail time, or even redeployment to Iraq," he says in the video posted just two days ago. "The people of Canada support us."
<p></p>
There are more then 200 US war deserters in Canada avoiding service in Iraq. A recent poll showed that 64% of Canadians believe they should be allowed to stay.
