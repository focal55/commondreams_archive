WASHINGTON, DC - May 28 -  “We applaud Congressman Markey for his bold leadership on global warming. Today’s proposal marks an important step forward in the House of Representatives’ efforts to address the looming climate crisis.
 <p></p>
“Congressman Markey’s Investing in Climate Action and Protection Act appears to be the most comprehensive climate bill drafted in the House, and Congress should carefully consider the legislation as it crafts an effective response to climate change.
  <p></p>
“We're particularly pleased that his bill would combine strong environmental protections with sound measures to protect American jobs and family budgets. 
  <p></p>
“We look forward to working with Congressman Markey, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the House leadership to bring a strong bill to the House floor as soon as possible.”
 <p></p>
