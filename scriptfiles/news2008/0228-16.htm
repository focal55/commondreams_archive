<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 28 -Today the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) announced its revised proposal to protect 
certain areas of Canada lynx habitat. The 
proposal marks the first time that FWS has been required by a court to 
reconsider a critical habitat designation that was influenced improperly by 
former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Interior Julie Macdonald – a political 
appointee who altered the original designation to exclude U.S. Forest Service, 
Bureau of Land Management, State and private lands.
</p><p><em>The following is a statement by Jamie Rappaport 
Clark, executive vice president of Defenders of Wildlife and former director of 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the 
Clinton administration.</em></p>
<p>“While we are 
pleased that the Fish and Wildlife 
Service has recognized that its previous decision to exclude virtually all lynx 
habitat from protection was improper, this new proposal still falls short of 
offering adequate protections to the lynx.</p>
<p>“The new proposal 
addresses several shortcomings in the previous critical habitat designation for 
the lynx, but fails to go far enough to ensure the continued survival and 
recovery of the lynx.&nbsp; For example, 
although FWS has moved toward including important habitat such as the Greater 
Yellowstone Area in Wyoming and Montana, the proposal leaves out significant 
habitat occupied by the lynx in other important areas, such as in Washington and 
Colorado. Moreover, the positive step of FWS re-proposing lynx habitat in Maine 
for protection—an area that was stripped of protection at the hands of Ms. 
MacDonald—is tempered by the fact that FWS continues to discount the importance 
of areas that serve as important lynx dispersal habitat or that could support 
lynx if managed properly.</p>
<p>“The science 
is clear regarding the lynx’s need for substantial protected habitat, especially 
in light of the continuing impacts of global warming on the lynx and it habitat. 
Defenders will continue to push the Service, as we have had to do now for 17 
years, to designate sufficient 
habitat to ensure the lynx’s recovery, based on science and the needs of the 
lynx, rather than politics.”</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>The Endangered Species Act requires that 
for every species protected as threatened or endangered, the federal agency 
charged with recovering the species designate and protect those areas that are 
essential to the species’ recovery.&nbsp; 
These&nbsp;areas are designated as critical habitat, and federal agencies 
are prohibited from taking or permitting actions that will destroy or adversely 
modify this vital habitat.</p>
<p>The new FWS proposal 
comes in response to Defenders of Wildlife’s notice to FWS that it would sue if 
the agency did not withdraw and reconsider the flawed Canada lynx protection 
plan, which FWS has admitted was influenced by political meddling, and follows a 
court-ordered schedule entered in ongoing litigation by Defenders against 
FWS.</p>
<p>Defenders of Wildlife 
is represented in the litigation by the Washington, 
D.C. public-interest law 
firm of Meyer Glitzenstein &amp; Crystal.&nbsp;
