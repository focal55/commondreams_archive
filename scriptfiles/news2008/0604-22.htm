WASHINGTON, DC - June 4 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund applauds the formation of the Congressional Equality Caucus for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Americans. Congressional leaders announced the launch of the caucus today at a Capitol Hill press conference. The event featured U.S. Reps. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who will serve as co-chairs, as well as a number of the caucus’ vice chairs and members.</p>


<p align="center"><b>Statement by Rea Carey, Acting Executive Director
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund</b></p>

<p>“We applaud this historic event, where a diverse coalition of congressional members has come together in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality. The caucus consists of members who are longtime allies and friends of our community, and we look forward to working with them in the next Congress to advance key legislative priorities around hate crimes, a repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ and passage of a fully inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act.<br><br>

“We also hope to expand our work in other important areas that affect LGBT individuals, such as health care, aging, homeless youth, anti-bullying legislation and securing funding for social service programs. We extend special thanks to U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin and her staff for organizing today’s event as well as to Chairman Frank and the rest of the more than 50 members of the caucus for their years of dedication and tireless work.”<br>
