<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 25 - "The conduct of Senate Republicans yesterday was shameless.  After weeks of insisting that it is absolutely critical to finish the FISA legislation by February 1, even going so far as to object to a one-month extension of the Protect America Act, they obstructed all efforts to actually work on the bill.  Now they want to simply ram the deeply flawed Intelligence Committee bill through the Senate.  They refused to allow amendments to be offered or voted on, including my straight-forward amendment to require that the government provide copies of FISA Court orders and pleadings for review in a classified setting, so that Members of Congress can understand how FISA has been interpreted and is being applied.  If the Republicans succeed in cutting off debate on Monday, the Senate won't even get to vote on the amendment Senator Dodd and I want to offer to deny retroactive immunity to telecom companies that allegedly cooperated with the administration's illegal wiretapping program. <P></P>

“Democrats should not allow the Republicans to ram this bill through the Senate without amendments.  Monday's cloture vote will be a test of whether the majority is willing to stand up to the administration and stand up for our rights."<!-- #EndEditable -->
