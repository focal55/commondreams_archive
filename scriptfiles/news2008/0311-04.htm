<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 11 -  Defenders of Wildlife has filed a notice of 
intent to sue in Washington D.C. district court to compel the Bush administration 
to create a recovery plan for jaguars in the Southwest. In February, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) stated that it would not be drafting a recovery 
plan for the jaguar, claiming that despite the presence of jaguars in the United 
States and the existence of large swaths of prime jaguar habitat, this big cat 
is biologically a “foreign” species and as such does not qualify for formal 
recovery planning. </p>
<p>“The jaguar is as 
American a species as the bald eagle,” said Craig Miller, southwest 
representative of Defenders of Wildlife. “When the eagle was in danger of 
extinction in the United 
States, we didn’t give up and say, ‘There are plenty in 
Canada, so we don’t need them here in the States.’ It 
doesn’t make sense that the agency would be willing to let the jaguar fade from 
the Southwest just because there is a larger population across the 
border.”</p>
<p>Defenders is considering 
legal action in this instance not only because FWS has a responsibility to 
protect this particular species, but also because there are many other species 
in the United States with populations that exist both here and across borders in 
Mexico, Canada and other nations. Some of these species, including sea turtles, 
grizzly bears, woodland caribou and numerous bird species, are threatened or 
endangered and thus require a recovery plan which provides a road map to 
achieving healthy, sustainable populations. </p>
<p>“The Bush 
administration’s decision to forgo creating a recovery plan for the jaguar sets 
a dangerous precedent for all threatened and endangered species that live along 
our borders,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, executive vice president for Defenders 
of Wildlife and former director of FWS. “Animals do not recognize man-made 
political boundaries. They do not know whether they are in the 
United 
States, Mexico or Canada, but they do know a good home when they see one. 
This cross-our-fingers-and-hope approach to conserving species along the 
U.S. borders could result in us giving up on keeping 
some of the most amazing species on the planet around for all Americans to 
enjoy.”</p>
<p>According to Defenders, 
FWS has failed to respond to repeated calls over the last decade from scientists 
requesting that the wildlife agency develop a recovery plan for the American 
jaguar, as required by law. Most recently, in 2007, the prestigious American 
Society of Mammologists issued a resolution stating “jaguars continue to 
decline throughout significant portions of their remaining range” and 
“habitats for jaguars 
in the United 
States, including 
Arizona and 
New 
Mexico, are vital to the 
long-term resilience and survival of the species.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>“The U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service has the duty to protect and recover imperiled wildlife, but 
when they ignore science for politics, citizens must ensure that wildlife laws 
are upheld.&nbsp; The future of 
America’s jaguars is at stake,” said Miller. </p><p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/programs_and_policy/wildlife_conservation/imperiled_species/jaguar/index.php" target="_new">Learn more about what Defenders is doing to save the jaguar.</a>
