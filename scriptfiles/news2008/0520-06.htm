NEW ORLEANS, LA - May 20 - <span> </span>"Iraq? Somalia? Afghanistan? No, this
is the United States of America, ground zero, desolation row, lower ninth ward,
New Orleans," says Real News Network analyst Pepe Escobar in front of homes
that remain destroyed almost three years after Hurricane Katrina ravished the
city.
<p></p>

<p>New Orleans has been busy reinventing itself as a
post-Katrina tourist Mecca. But scarce attention has been paid to an invisible
wall cutting across the city. Way beyond the renewed glitz of the French
Quarter and downtown casinos, the people of the Lower Ninth Ward still live in
the upheaval they were left with, almost three years after the disaster.
Homeless citizens living in a tent city under a flyover and struggling families
trying to rebuild their homes and their lives talk about why they've chosen to
stay after so many have left for states with better school systems, health
care, and social security, and the high cost of living in the area with wages
that don't keep up. All the while, many of their children are being sent to a
war that is costing the country billions in tax dollars.</p><p></p>
