<p>NEW YORK - April 7 - More than 1000 Amnesty International activists, primarily students, from more than 10 states will converge in New York City on April 11 for a series of demonstrations at foreign consulates and United Nations (UN) missions to protest human rights abuses in Myanmar, Darfur (Sudan), Bhopal (India), Sri Lanka and Libya. The demonstrations are part of the 13th annual "Get on the Bus" (GOTB), organized by Amnesty International USA Group 133, of Somerville, MA.
<p></p>
Activists demonstrating outside the Libyan Mission to the UN will call for the release of political prisoner Fathi El-Jahmi, who was arrested in 2004 after calling for political reforms in Libya and criticizing Colonel Mu'ammar al-Gaddafi; he has been detained without trial ever since. El-Jahmi's brother, Mohamed, will participate in the demonstration and give a morning talk on his work to free Fathi.
<p></p>
At the Sri Lankan Mission, activists will call for the country's government to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the 2006 murder of journalist Subramaniyam Sugirdharajan. At least 10 media workers have been killed in Sri Lanka since the beginning of 2006. Outside the Sudanese Mission, demonstrators will call on Sudan to bring individuals responsible for the rapes, killing and displacement in Darfur to justice.
<p></p>
A demonstration at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza will call on Myanmar (Burma) to stop the crackdown on pro-democracy activists, monks, students and others, and demand the release of all political prisoners, including Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. A smaller group will demonstrate outside the Indian Consulate, demanding justice for the survivors of the 1984 Bhopal chemical disaster. Union Carbide (now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical) has evaded accountability for the disaster; the demonstrators will call on India to compel Dow Chemical to appear before the Indian courts.
<p></p>
Get on the Bus is the largest volunteer-organized Amnesty International event in the country. The first event, in 1996, had 30 people; this year's demonstrations are expected to be the largest ever. For more information about Get On The Bus, please see: www.gotb.org
