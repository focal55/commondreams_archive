<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 16 - Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder issued the following statement in response to President George W. Bush’s planned global warming announcement today:
<p></p>
“President Bush’s proposal is a transparent attempt to block progress in the fight against global warming. This is a guy who broke his promise eight years ago to regulate global warming pollution, and who has fought tooth-and-nail on behalf of his oil company cronies ever since. The idea that President Bush is serious about fighting global warming is laughable. Fortunately, Bush’s attempt to impede progress doesn’t really matter. This is the last whimper from an increasingly irrelevant president. Bush will be gone in a matter of months and our country will then finally have an opportunity to show the leadership the world has been calling for.”
