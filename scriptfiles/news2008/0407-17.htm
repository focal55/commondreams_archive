<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 7 - The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) released a series of fact sheets today that offer a non-partisan analysis of key economic issues in the 2008 elections. In the series, CEPR economists present a concise, straight-forward examination of the recession, the costs of the Iraq War, Social Security, and the falling dollar to provide background on these and other important, yet complicated, issues.   "Heading into a serious economic downturn, it is clear that the economy will be the single most important factor influencing voters in 2008. We're offering a resource that provides some reality behind the rhetoric of the economic policies candidates are talking about," said Dean Baker, co- director of CEPR.

Is the war in Iraq causing the recession? How will the recession affect the average American? Do we need to reform Social Security? These are some of the economic questions already shaping the presidential race. The "Economics and the Elections" series of fact sheets looks at these issues and gives a straight-forward analysis of the topics that matter to the public.
  <P></P>
Some points discussed in the fact sheets include:
 <P></P><ul>
<li>Adjusted for inflation, the median American family's yearly income would drop $2,000 by 2010 in the case of a mild recession and by $3,700 by 2011 in the case of a severe recession
<br>
<li>Iraq War spending, while initially providing a boost to the economy, soon becomes a drain that leads to job loss
<br>
<li>Social Security can pay all future benefits until 2046 with no changes whatsoever 
 </ul><P></P>
In addition to the fact sheets, readers can access reports, issue-briefs, interviews and op-eds by CEPR economists and experts that deal with this year's elections. The full collection can be found here.

CEPR's Advisory Board of Economists includes Nobel Laureate economists Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz; Richard Freeman, Professor of Economics at Harvard University; and Eileen Appelbaum, Professor and Director of the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers University.<!-- #EndEditable -->
