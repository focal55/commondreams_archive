June 20 - Afghan and NATO troops, backed by helicopter gunships, launched a massive counter-attack Wednesday against Taliban militants occupying villages near Kandahar. This fighting comes as the US-led forces face the most menacing spring offensive the Taliban have launched since 2001.
<p></p>
NATO's success now hinges on cooperation with neighboring Pakistan, whose porous borders allow free movement of Taliban fighters between the two countries. Questions now are emerging about what role Pakistan will play in further military action along the Afghanistan border.
<p></p>
The US has long supported Mursharraf and the People's Party in Pakistan.  However, Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim league has become part of a coalition forming the government in the largest province, Punjab, representing local sentiment.  New emerging settlements between the Pashtun government in the Northwestern Frontier Province and the Taliban have further stalled US efforts in the region.
<p></p>
Reports are surfacing that the ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence] is tipping off the tribal leaders about when an attack might come, with an under-the-table relationship between sections of the Pakistan military, the ISI, tribal leaders, and perhaps even al-Qaeda.  US backed Afghanistan leader Karzai has also questioned the role of Pakistan in the conflict.  As part of negotiations between the Taliban and Pakistan, it is believed that agreements are being reached to keep the conflict outside Pakistan and allow the Taliban to regroup within Afghanistan. 
<p></p>
The Real News Network's Senior Analyst Aijaz Ahmed says in part two of this four part interview that disruption of the forming coalitions and a strengthening of the US backed government has been a result.  "In Pakistan, most people are saying that the principal objective of those bombings was to disrupt the negotiations—and of course the negotiations have fallen apart," says Ahmed.  "He has dealt with the Americans, he has dealt with Afghanis, he has dealt with NATO. We don't have anybody who really has this experience, so let him stay president. Two weeks ago, before those bombings, Musharraf seemed to be on his way out. Today, I think Musharraf has been strengthened by this."
