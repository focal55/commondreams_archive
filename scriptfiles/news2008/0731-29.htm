WASHINGTON - July 31 - The nation’s leading voice for the national parks, the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) today reacted to an investigation by <i>Mother Jones</i> magazine ("<a target="_new" href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2008/07/mary-mcfate-sapone-gun-lobby-nra-spy.html">There’s Something About Mary: Unmasking a Gun Lobby Mole</a>," July 30, 2008), which identified a prominent gun control activist as having active ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA). </p>
<p>NPCA has confirmed that this individual, Mary Lou Sapone, also known as Mary McFate, has participated in multiple confidential conversations and email correspondence over the past few months <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npca.org/keep_parks_safe">about efforts to keep visitors and wildlife safe</a> in our national parks. Currently, firearms are allowed in national parks as long as they are unloaded and put away; under pressure from the NRA, the Administration has proposed to weaken this reasonable Reagan-era regulation, which is supported by all six former directors of the National Park Service. According to the <i>Mother Jones</i> article, Sapone, who served as director of federal legislation at the States United Against Gun Violence, "took a keen interest" in this issue. </p>
<p>A statement by NPCA Legislative Representative Bryan Faehner follows:</p>

<p>"If the investigation by <i>Mother Jones</i> proves true, then the NRA will have effectively spied on our ongoing efforts to keep visitors and wildlife safe in our national parks. If true, this is a troubling display of the lengths to which the NRA will go to further its agenda."</p>
<p>The public comment period for the Administration’s proposal to allow loaded guns in national parks closes August 8, 2008.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
