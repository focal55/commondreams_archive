<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 1 - Following a new report stating that NATO member states have fallen drastically short in delivering promised aid to Afghanistan, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today called on NATO members to remedy this failure, including by donating to the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund – a program created to immediately assist civilians caught in the crossfire of the war.
 <br>
<br>

The Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR) released a report Tuesday faulting many countries for failing to deliver 10 billion dollars in promised humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. The report noted that Afghanistan depends heavily on foreign aid and failure to follow through with such pledges is a significant factor in the country’s continued slow rate of development. CIVIC noted that in a striking example of lackluster aid donations, only seven out of twenty-six NATO members have given to the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund since its inception over a year ago.
<br>
<br>
 
The Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund, established in December 2006 by NATO member states, was created to provide food, rebuilding and other aid to communities unintentionally harmed by ISAF (International Security and Assistance Force) combat operations. According to NATO officials, the Fund has shown success at winning back local Afghan support from initial reactions of anger and resentment, particularly following Operation Silver last year. Countries that have donated to the Fund include: the United States, Australia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania and the Netherlands, for a total of approximately $3.4 million USD.  A good portion of that balance has already been spent rebuilding communities damaged by ISAF combat operations.
<br>
<br>
 
“This war will not be won with military might alone,” said Holewinski. “Donating funds to help war victims should be a no-brainer for any NATO member with a stake in Afghanistan – and that means all of them.”
<br>
<br>
 
<em>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and helped by the warring parties involved. In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by suicide bomb. CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision.</em><!-- #EndEditable -->
