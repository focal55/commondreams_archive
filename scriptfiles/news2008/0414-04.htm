<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MN - April 14 - The long-term sustainability of the fast-moving global biofuel market will depend
on changes to international trade and investment rules that govern energy, environment,
agriculture and rural development, according to a new paper published by the Institute for Agriculture
and Trade Policy (IATP) and the London-based International Institute for Environment
and Development (IIED).<br>
<br>

“This industry has developed so quickly that governments at all levels, but particularly at the
global level, have been slow to set rules on how to manage its growth,” said Sophia Murphy,
IATP Senior Advisor and author of the paper. “It is critical that governments set global rules
that support environmental sustainability and economic development for more than just a few
companies.”<br>
<br>

The paper, “The Multilateral Trade and Investment Context for Biofuels: Issues and Challenges,”
outlines the different interests of the largest global players in the biofuel market, including
the U.S., European Union and Brazil. The paper analyzes biofuel trade within the context of
World Trade Organization rules governing agriculture, environmental goods, services, patents
and investment. Biofuels raise a number of tricky trade questions, including the acceptability
of production and processing methods (PPMs) as a basis for discrimination among goods; the
legitimacy of trade restrictive measures that support goals set in multilateral environmental
agreements; and the effects of private standards on market access.<br>
<br>

Current biofuel feedstocks are energy-intensive and involve largely industrial-scale monocultural
production. In parts of the world, biofuel feedstock production is taking a heavy environmental
toll on water, soil and ecological biodiversity. Investment from foreign firms seeking
biofuel feedstock is also aggravating land disputes and intensifying the political fight to protect
food security. The paper discusses some of the issues on developing sustainability standards for
biofuel production and calls for a multilateral discussion to set trade and investment rules that
support a fair and sustainable biofuel sector.<br>
<br>

“International guidelines could complement what will ultimately be local and national decisions,”
said Murphy. “Such guidelines could carve out space for policies that are dictated by
human rights and environmental norms, and could help to reshape trade and investment obligations
to be more supportive of sustainable development.”<br>
