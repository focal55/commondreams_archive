WASHINGTON - July 2 -Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement: <br>
<br>
“I want to praise the sensible managers at Atlanta’s Hartsfield International Airport, for putting public safety first in declaring yesterday that they will strenuously enforce the firearms rule in that facility.&nbsp; These public servants are doing their job and should be congratulated for that.&nbsp; <br>

<br>
“The Atlanta airport is one of the busiest in the world.&nbsp; Seven years ago, our nation learned what can happen when airport security is breached. None of us will ever forget the consequences.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
“The gun lobby leaders in Georgia should be ashamed of themselves for being willing to trade on our nation’s safety for the purposes of advancing their extremist agenda.”</p><p align="center"># # #</p>
<p style="font-style: oblique;" align="left"></p><p align="left">
As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign, with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters, works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws, regulations and public policies.  The Brady Campaign is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence,   where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our communities.
