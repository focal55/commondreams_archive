WASHINGTON, DC - June 2 - Millions of tons of trash wind up in our nation’s rivers and streams every year, and American Rivers is harnessing the community pride of thousands of Americans to do something about it. The nation’s leading river conservation organization is encouraging citizens to take part in National River Cleanup, June 2-8, 2008.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since its inception in 1992, National River Cleanup has helped raise public awareness about the health of our nation’s rivers and streams, and has inspired citizens to take action. Over the years more than 500,000 volunteers have participated in over 4,500 cleanups across the country, covering more than 100,000 miles of waterways.&nbsp; </p>
<p>National River Cleanup is made possible through the generous support of partners including Tom’s of Maine and Green Mountain Coffee. Subaru is the official vehicle of National River Cleanup. </p>
<p>“Last year alone, more than 600 tons of trash was removed from our rivers by National River Cleanup volunteers,” said Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>“With so many cleanups all across the country, odds are that there is one right in your own backyard,” added Wodder. “And if there isn’t, there can be. Organizing a river cleanup is a tremendously rewarding experience. Registering your cleanup only takes a few seconds at AmericanRivers.org.” </p>
<p>“A cleaner river is a healthier one, and healthy rivers bring so many benefits to our communities. You can’t find a more hands-on way to get people directly involved in protecting the rivers they love,” added Wodder. </p>
<p>Thanks to new tools on <a href="http://www.americanrivers.org/cleanup" target="_new">www.AmericanRivers.org/cleanup</a>, registering a cleanup has never been easier. This year, American Rivers has increased and improved the support it gives to cleanup organizers including hosting individual event web pages for all registered cleanups, volunteer recruitment tools for organizers, and a Cleanup Organizer’s Handbook. American Rivers also provides free trash bags to cleanup organizers. Prospective volunteers can quickly find the cleanup nearest to them, sign up for the cleanup of their choice, and keep up to date with all the latest National River Cleanup news.</p>
<p>River cleanups are fun for all ages. Many environmental organizations, civic clubs, paddle-sports groups, federal and state agencies, and schools organize cleanups in their communities.</p>
