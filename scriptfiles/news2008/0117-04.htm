<p>MINNEAPOLLIS, MINNESOTA - January 17 - Several European countries and
the Canadian province of Ontario have recently adopted feed-in tariffs,
a mandated, long-term premium price for renewable energy paid by the
local utility company to renewable energy producers. A new study by the
Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) shows how feed-in tariffs
enable citizens to participate in turbocharging Minnesota’s renewable
electricity standard, and reduce costs.
<p></p>
“A feed-in tariff is a tool to let everyday people join the renewable
energy revolution. Unlike complicated tax credits or corporate equity
partnerships, it’s a straight payment from the utility to my backyard
wind farm,” says study author John Farrell. “Not only can communities
produce renewable power in their backyards, they can produce real
economic development in the backyard, as well.”
<p></p>
Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariffs (REFITs) level the playing field by
scaling renewable prices by the project size and the available resource
(e.g. wind speed). The adjustable price supports small-scale projects
while growing renewables on a large scale. Feed-in tariffs also lend
muscle to a state’s renewable electricity mandate.
<p></p>
“Evidence in European countries shows that feed-in tariffs encourage
more renewable energy production for a lower cost than a mandate alone.
That’s because, unlike the targets in a renewable mandate, a feed-in
tariff is a financially transparent tool for getting projects built.”
<p></p>

Renewables and Expand Local Ownership, can be viewed online at
