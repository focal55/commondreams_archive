 WASHINGTON, DC - June 13 - SEIU today sent a fourth “Dear John” letter to Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. SEIU members are offering their assistance in the absence of any economic blueprint from McCain that puts working families first. The letters will continue until McCain personally meets with members.
 <p></p>
In the letter, Iris English, a Medical Billing Specialist at the University of Illinois Medical Center from Chicago and member of Local 73, asks McCain how he would use the money currently being spent in Iraq here in America.
  <p></p>
“Dear John,
  <p></p>
“Let’s set aside for a minute that we have a fundamental disagreement about the war in Iraq.  While you think we should stay there anywhere from one to 100 years, I think we need to bring our troops home now.  But for now I want to look past that and focus on how you would spend those resources here when it does end.
  <p></p>
“It is reported that Iraq spending amounts to more than $10 BILLION every single month. Those billions would help fix the problems we are facing here at home, especially now that we are facing a growing recession.
  <p></p>
“My question is how would you spend the more than $120 billion? That much money could provide health care coverage for every American that needs it. Would you do that? Here in Illinois, we are facing a $2 billion deficit. Would you use the money to help states like mine so they don’t have to cut back on services like educating our kids or fixing our roads? The cost of gas is hitting my family’s budget hard, causing us to scale back not just on luxuries but also on necessities. Would you use it to invest in alternatives so America can break its addiction to oil?
  <p></p>
“Or would you use it as a partial payment to fund your proposed plan for a corporate tax cut, which your campaign admits will cost us $300 billion and do nothing to help a hardworking taxpayer like me?
  <p></p>
“It seems to me that while you don’t believe in tax dollars going to fund domestic programs, you have no problem driving America further into debt for Iraq. I am afraid that as president you will continue the current Bush policies because you are out of touch with the problems facing American families like mine.
  <p></p>
“How about giving us some straight talk and release an economic plan that actually helps working families, not just the Washington lobbyists that staff your campaign from top to bottom.”
