<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 28 - Today Food &amp; Water Watch filed a
lawsuit against the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration after the agency
withheld information on how many inspections of products and facilities it
conducted over the past seven years across the country. Food &amp; Water Watch
submitted a <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/food/foodsafety/meat-inspection-1/usda-meat-inspectors-vacancies/#documentContent" target="_new" class="external-link">request in August 2007 for the agency’s work plans</a> under the
Freedom of Information Act, but the agency denied the group’s request.</p>

<p>“In light of the import safety problems in recent months,
consumers need to know how our food system works,” stated Food &amp; Water
Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter. “The Food and Drug Administration is chronically short on resources to
address food safety, and we are being denied important information on how the
agency has managed these resources to protect consumers in the face of
ever-increasing food imports.”</p>
<p>According to the claim filed at the U.S. District Court in
Washington, DC today, FDA illegally withheld its “work plans” for FDA’s field
inspection staff. These work
plans detail the agency’s yearly goals for performing inspection activities for
ensuring the safety of food, drugs, cosmetics, biologics, medical devices,
animal feed and drugs, and radiation–emitting products.</p>
<p>Inadequate funding and limited staffing have made it
difficult for FDA to oversee the safety of 80 percent of all food products. FDA’s
ability to ensure the safety of the nation’s food and drug supply has come
under increased scrutiny after a string of high-profile cases of food–borne
illness and drug–related deaths, including <em>E. coli</em>–tainted spinach, <em>Salmonella</em>–contaminated
snack foods, melamine–tainted dog foods, and chemically–tainted heparin. In recent appearances before Congress,
FDA officials have been unable to answer questions about what resources the
agency needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“FDA has failed
in its mission of protecting the public from unsafe food,” stated Hauter. “Even
Members of Congress have asked the agency for this information.&nbsp; The
public deserves to know how FDA is using taxpayers’ money.”</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
