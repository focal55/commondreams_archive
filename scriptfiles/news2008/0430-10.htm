<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 30 - “More than any other Administration in recent history, this Administration 
          has a penchant for secrecy. To an unprecedented degree, it has invoked 
          executive privilege to thwart congressional oversight and the state 
          secrets privilege to shut down lawsuits. It has relied increasingly 
          on secret evidence and closed tribunals, not only in Guantanamo but 
          here in the United States. And it has initiated secret programs involving 
          surveillance, detention, and interrogation, some of the details of which 
          remain unavailable today, even to Congress.
<p>“These examples are the topic of much discussion and concern, 
          and appropriately so. But there is a particularly sinister trend that 
          has gone relatively unnoticed – the increasing prevalence in our 
          country of secret law.</p>
        <p>“The notion of ‘secret law’ has been described in 
          court opinions and law treatises as ‘repugnant’ and ‘an 
          abomination.’ It is a basic tenet of democracy that the people 
          have a right to know the law. In keeping with this principle, the laws 
          passed by Congress and the case law of our courts have historically 
          been matters of public record. And when it became apparent in the middle 
          of the 20th century that federal agencies were increasingly creating 
          a body of non-public administrative law, Congress passed several statutes 
          requiring this law to be made public, for the express purpose of preventing 
          a regime of ‘secret law.’</p>
        <p>“That purpose today is being thwarted. Congressional enactments 
          and agency regulations are for the most part still public. But the law 
          that applies in this country is determined not only by statutes and 
          regulations, but also by the controlling interpretations of courts and, 
          in some cases, the executive branch. More and more, this body of executive 
          and judicial law is being kept secret from the public, and too often 
          from Congress as well.</p>

        <p>“The recent release of the March 2003 John Yoo torture memorandum 
          has shone a sobering light on this practice. A legal interpretation 
          by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, binds 
          the entire executive branch, just like a regulation or the ruling of 
          a court. In the words of former OLC head Jack Goldsmith, ‘These 
          executive branch precedents are “law” for the executive 
          branch.’ The Yoo memorandum was, for a nine-month period in 2003 
          until it was withdrawn by Mr. Goldsmith, the law that this Administration 
          followed when it came to matters of torture. And of course, that law 
          was essentially a declaration that few if any laws applied.</p>
        <p>“This entire memorandum was classified and withheld from Congress 
          and the public for years on the claim that it contained information 
          that could not be disclosed without harming national security. Now it 
          may be appropriate, prior to public disclosure of an OLC memorandum, 
          to redact information about, for example, specific intelligence sources 
          or methods. But as we now know, this 81-page document contains no information 
          about sources, methods, or any other operational information that could 
          compromise national security. What it contains is a shocking glimpse 
          of the ‘law’ that governed the Administration’s conduct 
          during the period this memo was in effect. And the many, many footnoted 
          references to other OLC memos we’ve never seen suggests that there 
          is an entire regime of secret law that may be just as shocking.</p>
        <p>“Another body of secret law is the controlling interpretations 
          of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that are issued by the 
          Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. FISA, of course, is the law 
          that governs the government’s ability in intelligence investigations 
          to conduct wiretaps and search the homes of people in the United States. 
          Under that statute, the FISA Court is directed to evaluate wiretap and 
          search warrant applications and decide whether the standard for issuing 
          a warrant has been met – a largely factual evaluation that is 
          properly done behind closed doors. But with the evolution of technology 
          and with this Administration’s efforts to get the Court’s 
          blessing for its illegal wiretapping activities, we now know that the 
          Court’s role is broader, and that it is very much engaged in substantive 
          interpretations of the governing statute.</p>
        <p>“These interpretations are as much a part of this country’s 
          surveillance law as the statute itself. Without access to them, it is 
          impossible for Congress or the public to have an informed debate on 
          matters that deeply affect the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans. 
          While some aspects of the FISA Court’s work involve operational 
          details and should not be publicly disclosed, I do not believe that 
          same presumption must apply to the Court’s purely legal interpretations 
          of what the statute means. Yet the Administration has fought tooth and 
          nail against public disclosure of how the Court interprets the law, 
          and has strictly limited even congressional access to some of those 
          decisions.</p>
        <p>“The Administration’s shroud of secrecy extends to agency 
          rules and executive pronouncements, such as Executive Orders, that carry 
          the force of law. Through the diligent efforts of my colleague Senator 
          Whitehouse, we have learned that OLC has taken the position that a President 
          can ‘waive’ or ‘modify’ a published Executive 
          Order without any notice to the public or Congress – simply by 
          not following it.</p>
        <p>“Now, none of us disputes that a President can withdraw or revise 
          an Executive Order at any time; that’s every President’s 
          prerogative. But abrogating an Executive Order without any public notice 
          works a secret change in the law. Worse, because the published Order 
          stays on the books, it actively misleads Congress and the public as 
          to what the law is. That has the effect – presumably, the intended 
          effect – of derailing any accountability or oversight that could 
          otherwise occur.</p>

        <p>“And that gets us to the heart of the problem. In a democracy, 
          the government must be accountable to the people, and that means the 
          people must know what their government is doing. Through the classification 
          system and the common law, we’ve carved out limited exceptions 
          for highly sensitive factual information about military operations, 
          intelligence sources and methods, nuclear programs, and the like. That 
          is entirely appropriate and important to protecting our national security. 
          But even in these areas, Congress and the courts must maintain some 
          access to the information to ensure that the President is acting in 
          accordance with the law and the Constitution. And when it comes to the 
          law that governs the executive branch’s actions, Congress, the 
          courts, and the public have the right and the need to know what law 
          is in effect. An executive branch that operates pursuant to secret law 
          makes a mockery of the democratic principles and freedoms on which this 
          country was based.</p>
        <p>“We’ll hear today from several experts who can help us 
          understand the extent of this problem and help us begin to think about 

          solutions.”<br>
