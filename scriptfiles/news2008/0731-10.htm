WASHINGTON - July 31 - Today former Director of the
FBI William S. Sessions joined the Constitution Project in urging members of
the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and
Civil Liberties to support the State Secrets Protection Act of 2008. Since
September 11th, the executive branch has repeatedly asserted that this
privilege prevents individuals from challenging federal policies - like the
extraordinary rendition and torture of German citizen Khaled El-Masri and the
warrantless NSA spying program - in court. The Act, sponsored by Subcommittee
Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) would reform the privilege to ensure access to the courts while protecting sensitive national security information. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">"As a former Director of the FBI and United States Attorney, I
fully understand and support our government's need to protect sensitive
national security information," said Judge Sessions, who submitted a
<a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001mXejKEFH5mEwTKSWF-Svtj8Hl56B6ynJPjAWwoA_i-K5zvBrqYfIFQQgspsCfZK2VrCyumc5HGSpOro75SlfUWI3woHA8GaQE09kAH5F7w90ecAHRYArASWmHuzyWRYqY-1I_PLV55waCwFXqUnLgL3oxl7g3hm8-RzKqdYuYNNZF26xn1VNAK-UE8XrkZadW3XzxTBwWCRtsuYGQS1S1w==" target="_blank">formal statement </a>to the Subcommittee. "But granting executive branch officials
unchecked discretion to determine whether evidence should be subject to the
state secrets privilege provides too great a temptation for abuse. The reforms
contained in the State Secrets Protections Act will help preserve our
constitutional system of checks and balances."</span></p>



<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the
executive branch has repeatedly asserted the state secrets privilege in cases
challenging the government's national security policies," said Sharon Bradford
Franklin, senior counsel at the Constitution Project and primary author of the Constitution
Project's <a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001mXejKEFH5mEDW7-cJ_5bm3s4R1gxvqvyOZJrIAJ-7H90ybJVQQu-Qxmuq8sxNADfIDtW6MLcfvhi5cU0K9BwuKTeNGa2-2mCzruKvQOXPsaoBW-qyhr17wcAK_gdJYrouGMCBZmqhvbHTWUAOcGE7tykYx17H9dwXoKRRimOsUAc_jofBjfFrsHp1A4pEJlE7DPscN-nFOw9ryZu0uD_dw==" target="_blank">statement </a>to the Subcommittee. "While there is a proper role for the
state secrets privilege to protect actual national security secrets from public
disclosure, the executive branch should not be able to hide behind this
privilege on the basis of its own unchecked authority. The State Secrets
Protection Act would provide critical safeguards that are needed to ensure a
proper balance of the interests of private parties, constitutional liberties,
and national security."</span></p>



<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">The Constitution Project's bipartisan
Liberty and
Security Committee previously issued a <a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001mXejKEFH5mG1HM-cq22BM0oxD6WoSrwY-Fvwd1JxniwtAksQiRQcmZ9geYe3uuXVOvEzXFtrcggs1lllK4juR-B6N_8aWVutRFxAT0Y_evjk6KWBcbyaMt-Asds93iBhYjA6g8mxakxAir1XZVqq8ok_oi29h3D0XRVls3TD2zegNOr9vDd__ogSNTcRdfoJQqdz04BsO7Y=" target="_blank">report </a>calling for legislative reform of
the privilege. The statement recognized that the executive branch must have some
ability to restrict the public disclosure of sensitive information, but criticized the
breadth of the assertions of the privilege, as well as the executive branch's
opposition to any review by an independent judge.</span>
