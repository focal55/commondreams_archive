SEATTLE - June 2 - <a href="http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/" target="_new">Reclaim the Media</a> is honoring some of its "media heroes" by publishing a deck of <a href="http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/mediaheroes" target="_new">trading cards</a> recognizing the accomplishments of twenty-one praiseworthy journalists, media activists, and educators.
<p></p>
The honored media heroes include historical figures such as legendary anti-lynching reporter Ida B. Wells, Newspaper Guild founder Heywood Broun, and Elias Boudinot, founder/editor of the first Native American newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix. Also recognized are contemporary media movers and shakers, including intrepid PBS producer Bill Moyers, Paper Tiger TV co-founder DeeDee Halleck, Puerto Rican community activist Richie Pérez, and others. Organizations or collaborations singled out for hero status include news program Democracy Now!, media watch group FAIR, and the Children's Television Workshop, creators of Sesame Street.
<p></p>
RTM executive director Jonathan Lawson said of the cards: "We're proud to honor just a small handful of our heroes -  media activists, journalists and teachers who have worked passionately and creatively to promote justice and civic engagement. We hope that these educational cards will inspire more people to follow the examples of our heroes – expanding critical conversations about journalism, and ensuring the health of media that supports democratic values and communications rights."
<p></p>
Each 'Media Heroes' card features original artwork by Seattle artist Michael Leavitt and a brief biographical profile. The cards, set to make a national debut this week at the National Conference on Media Reform in Minneapolis, are also available as a deck from Reclaim the Media's website, <a href="http://www.reclaimthemedia.org" target="_new">www.reclaimthemedia.org</a>.
