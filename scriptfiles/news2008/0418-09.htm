<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 18 - In the wake of a new report by Ceres on the still weak track  record of U.S. mutual funds  on climate-related shareholder resolutions, Co-op America is urging tens of thousands  of Americans to contact the 10 of the nation’s largest mutual funds to do more  on global warming.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
				<p>Available at <a href="http://www.coopamerica.org/takeaction/mutualfunds/" target="_new">http://www.coopamerica.org/takeaction/mutualfunds/</a>,  the Co-op America online campaign is “calling on American  Century, American Funds, Ameriprise, Dreyfus, Fidelity, ING, Morgan Stanley,  Oppenheimer, Pioneer and Vanguard to wake up to the reality of  climate change and step up to their responsibility to protect their investments  and vote for progress at the companies in their portfolios, each and every time  they have the chance.”</p>

				<p>The campaign from Co-op America also notes: <em>“Unfortunately, these 10 mutual fund  families do not vote in favor of climate change resolutions, abstaining or  voting against them instead for the last three years running. The shareholder  process provides ample opportunity for these funds to vote for a new way of  doing business, if only they would support other wiser shareholders' climate  change resolutions.&nbsp; These resolutions frequently call for companies to: disclose their climate emissions, explain the effects these  emissions will have on their business, and develop a  plan for reducing those emissions, thereby reducing the company's financial  risk due to climate change.”</em><br>
  &nbsp; <br>
			    Co-op America’s Corporate Responsibility  Director Todd Larsen said:&nbsp; <strong>“These 10 </strong><strong>mutual  fund families are acting like climate change won’t affect our planet, the  economy, and their investors. They invest in some of the companies with the  worst records on climate change -- companies like ExxonMobil, Ford, and Massey  Coal -- and yet time and time again, their largest funds fail to push these  companies to do better.&nbsp; As shareholders -- as part-owners of these  companies --&nbsp;mutual funds&nbsp;have both the <strong>right and responsibility</strong> to&nbsp;push  their companies to improve, not just because it’s the right thing to do, but  because polluting companies that&nbsp;will suffer under consumer pressure,  government regulation, and the changing times are a huge risk for the millions  of people represented by these ten major fund families.&nbsp; I<strong>t's  not just the right thing to do; it's good business.”</strong></strong></p>

				<p>Commenting on the new Ceres  report, Larsen said that it was encouraging to see some initial signs of  progress on climate resolutions at certain mutual funds. He noted that the slow  progress to date means that concerned individuals need to turn up the heat on  laggard funds and also look closely at socially responsible investing mutual  funds, which are leaders on climate change voting. (Information on SRI funds is  available at http://www.coopamerica.org/socialinvesting/.)</p>
				<p>Already, more than 3,000 people have sent a  message to mutual funds through the Co-op American site this year.&nbsp;Over  the past three years, nearly 60,000 people took actions targeting major U.S.  mutual funds on climate change.</p>
