<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 8 - Friends of the Earth Action announced today that it has expanded its “Fix or Ditch” campaign with a TV ad buy before the Feb. 12 primaries.  The campaign encourages senators to substantially improve or abandon the Lieberman-Warner global warming bill.

 
<P></P>
“Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have put forward strong plans on global warming—plans that do what scientists demand and make polluters pay for all pollution.  Why aren’t Senate Democrats following their lead?” asked Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder. “Senate Democrats should either fix or ditch the Lieberman-Warner bill.  It falls short on the science and gives polluters up to a trillion dollars.  Senate Democrats have to make a political calculation too.  This bill is sponsored by McCain supporters and could neutralize the Democrats’ advantage on global warming in the presidential campaign.”
<P></P>
 

Friends of the Earth Action is calling for Senators to ensure any global warming bill reduces emissions to at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050, that it makes polluters pay through a 100 percent auction of pollution permits, and that it invests new revenue fairly and wisely.  The bill advanced out of the Environment and Public Works Committee in December on an 11-8 vote.  The TV ads are airing on a variety of cable and broadcast stations.
