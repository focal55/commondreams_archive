<p>NEW YORK - January 23 - With the arrest of a top opposition figure and police assaults on supporters in advance of anti-government protests, Amnesty International urged Zimbabwean authorities today to exercise restraint to avoid further bloodshed.
<p></p>
One eyewitness told Amnesty International that police assaulted Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) supporters, who were on their way to the demonstration, and bundled them into a police van. Morgan Tsvangirai, a leader of one of the MDC factions, was arrested at about 4 a.m. today at his home by officers from the notorious Law and Order section of the Zimbabwe Republic Police. Tsvangirai, who was severely beaten by police last March, was detained for about four hours and then released without charge. Two other MDC officials were also arrested and released.
<p></p>
Simeon Mawanza, Amnesty International's researcher on Zimbabwe, who recently returned from the country, said: "The fact that there have already been assaults and three arrests – including of a leader of the planned protests -- is a worrying sign."
<p></p>
"We are deeply concerned about the continued harassment and intimidation of MDC leaders by the Zimbabwean government," said Mawanza. "The government must allow any peaceful protests to go ahead, and ensure the safety of all peaceful demonstrators and all people taken into police custody."
<p></p>
Lynn Fredriksson, advocacy director for Africa for Amnesty International USA, said police have severely limited political protests and activities by the MDC, human rights defenders and perceived opponents of President Mugabe's government while allowing ZANU-PF party members to assemble and engage in political activities without restrictions.
<p></p>
 "The police are acting in a partisan manner that directly violates international standards," she said. "The government of Zimbabwe must be made aware that the international community is watching closely its response to anti-government protests this week."
<p></p>
Police announced on Monday that the planned demonstration had been banned, despite the fact that they approved it two weeks ago.
<p></p>
The MDC appealed the ban and the Magistrates Court ruled that while MDC supporters cannot march through Harare, they can hold a rally in Glamis Arena, just outside the city.
<p></p>
The last time Tsvangirai and about 50 other MDC and civil society leaders were arrested (in March 2007), they were severely beaten and some were tortured.
<p></p>
"Police repeatedly arrest and beat human rights defenders and MDC activists engaging in peaceful protest," said Mawanza. "Detainees are then often ill-treated and denied access to lawyers, food and medicine. This behavior must stop."
