<p>WASHINGTON - January 28 - “In his final state of the union address, President Bush unfortunately continued to advocate positions and policies that have been harmful to our nation.  He once again attempted to bully Congress into giving broad powers to the executive branch far beyond what is necessary to protect the country from terrorists.  Congress must stand up to these tactics and pass a law that allows our intelligence community to go after al Qaeda and other threats to our national security while protecting the rights and freedoms of law-abiding Americans.

 <P></P>

“Perhaps most troubling was the President’s steadfast commitment to an Iraq policy that has led to the deaths of nearly 4,000 American troops, continues to cost this country billions of dollars per month, and fails to make us safer in the global fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.  The president’s policies are keeping nearly 160,000 American troops stuck in Iraq and sapping our ability to address the global terrorist threat presented by al Qaeda. 

  <P></P>

“As we continue to pay a tremendous price because of the administration’s myopic focus on Iraq, al Qaeda maintains its safe haven in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The recent bombings in Algeria also remind us that the enemy we face is global and that a narrow focus on Iraq is self-defeating.  Our next commander-in-chief will face great challenges in this critical region of the world, made more difficult because of the lack of attention the Bush administration has given to it.   

  <P></P>

“It is important to note that this is the last state of the union this President will give.  I look forward to working with whoever takes office as our next President to change course, and begin to undo the damage this Administration will leave behind.  We need to reform our broken health care system, and move away from a one-size-fits-all education policy.  We need a real commitment to protecting our environment, and to moving away from the flawed trade policies that have led to so many American workers watching their jobs leave this country.  I join many Americans in looking forward to addressing these challenges as the country prepares to move beyond the failed policies of this administration.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
