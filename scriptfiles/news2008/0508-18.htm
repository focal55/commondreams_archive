WASHINGTON, DC - May 8 - After Senators Joseph Lieberman (I-CT) and Susan Collins 
(R-ME) introduced a report on Islamic homegrown terrorism today, the American 
Civil Liberties Union strongly urged Congress to use caution when moving forward 
on related legislation, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism 
Prevention Act of 2007 (S. 1959). The report, "Violent Islamist Extremism, the 
Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorism Threat," is based on findings from 
hearings held by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs. The ACLU and nearly twenty other groups sent a memo to the committee 
outlining concerns with the report, most notably the free speech implications of 
labeling the internet as a "weapon" and the unfair singling out of one religious 
group as possible "extremists." </p>

<p>"Once we begin trying to regulate belief systems, we have veered perilously 
far from the Constitution," said Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU 
Washington Legislative Office. "Though the need to prevent criminal acts of 
violence is unquestionable, targeting communities based on religious beliefs is 
unacceptable and unproductive. We will only end up stigmatizing the Islamic 
community and creating a nation of Islamophobes. We should not be legislating 
against thought and we should certainly not be regulating religious or unpopular 
thought. A dynamic debate can only make this country stronger and safer."</p>
<p>The ACLU raised similar concerns regarding legislation passed by the House 
last year. The framework established by that measure could possibly lead to 
unconstitutional restrictions on speech and belief – in addition to more 
appropriate restrictions on actions. </p>
<p>Experience has demonstrated that in the event of a terrorist attack, the 
results of this report will likely be used to recommend the use of racial, 
ethnic and religious profiling. This will only heighten, rather than decrease, 
the spread of extremist violence. As an organization dedicated to the principles 
of freedom of speech, we cannot in good conscience support this report or any 
measure that might lead to censorship and persecution based solely on one’s 
personal beliefs. </p>
<p>The ACLU is concerned that identifying the Internet as a tool for terrorists 
will lead to censorship and regulated speech – especially since the Internet has 
become an essential communications and research tool for everyone. Indeed, some 
policy makers have advocated shutting down objectionable websites in violation 
of the First Amendment. It is an unworkable solution.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, terror comes in all shapes and sizes, and from all colors and 
religious backgrounds," said Timothy Sparapani, ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel. 
"Focusing on people with specific religious beliefs or backgrounds will not 
protect against the Timothy McVeigh's of the world. This narrow focus could cost 
us dearly in the future."</p>
