<p>WASHINGTON - January 22 -As United Nations forces end their third week of operations in Darfur, Amnesty International today warned that the security situation for displaced people is on a knife's edge with some 1 million children growing up displaced, hopeless and fearful, many in displacement camps awash with weapons -- a potentially explosive combination.
<P></P>
The over 2.6 million people displaced by the Darfur crisis have been left largely unprotected. The African Union force that was supposed to protect them was outmanned and outgunned by often government-backed Janjawid and armed rebel groups who frequently attacked them.
<P></P>
About 1 million children are among the displaced, with most living in sprawling internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Darfur, and others living across the border in eastern Chad in refugee camps the size of cities. The 12 refugee camps in eastern Chad are sheltering more than 240,000 Darfuri civilians forced to flee rampant violence. The Gereida IDP camp in Darfur, shelters 120,000 people. Another IDP camp -- Kalma -- shelters 90,000.
<P></P>
Armed groups continue to use camps in Darfur and Chad to recruit fighters – including children, the report warned. Angry and frustrated by a situation that appears hopeless, with no training, education or work available to them, some older youth are joining the armed groups.
<P></P>
"Ali," an internally displaced person in Abu Shouk camp, told Amnesty International: "The boys of 18 -- they are lost. They have no work, especially the graduates; they live on relief."
 <P></P>
Tawanda Hondora, deputy director of Amnesty International's Africa Program, said, "Almost all of the camps in Darfur are flooded with weapons. The security situation inside and outside of the camps continues to deteriorate, as hopes of a political resolution to the Darfur conflict recede and hostilities between the government and armed groups continue to escalate."
<P></P>
"The presence of weapons in the camps has worsened an already volatile security situation for everyone. In some camps, a revolver can be bought for only $25 -- leading to widespread incidents of robbery and assault. In this charged atmosphere of anger, fear, insecurity and political disagreements, quarrels often turn tragic."
<P></P>
In addition, rape and other violence is a constant danger for women.
<P></P>
This harsh picture is drawn from Amnesty International's new 27-page report, Displaced in Darfur -- A Generation of Anger, which outlines the current state of insecurity in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).
<P></P>
"One million children from Darfur see only a tragic present and a hopeless future," said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA. "Their suffering demands an immediate response from the international community and a commitment to improve security in the camps."
<P></P>
Hondora also warned that the same fate that hampered the African Union force will befall the newly deployed U.N. force in Darfur (UNAMID) unless clear signals are sent to warring groups that any attacks on the peacekeeping force or civilians are unacceptable.
<P></P>
"In addition, urgent steps must be taken to ensure that the government of Sudan removes all impediments to the complete deployment of UNAMID forces. The international community must also adequately strengthen UNAMID's resource capacity, including through the provision of ground and air transport equipment."
<P></P>
Amnesty International USA activists are currently urging members of the U.S. Congress to press for greater U.S. support to ensure the U.N. force has the land and air transportation equipment it needs.
<P></P>
The Sudanese army and police, who are obligated to protect civilians, are seen as antagonistic rather than protective by Darfuri IDPs, often arbitrarily arrested outside IDP camps on suspicion of being members of armed rebel groups.
<P></P>
Some camps, such as Kalma, include members of as many as 29 different ethnic groups. Most Kalma camp residents are believed to have weapons. Amnesty International has learned that many of the youth in the camp have formed vigilante groups based on ethnic origin -- Fur, Masalit, Zaghawa and Dajo. The UN recorded more than 10 armed incidents in Kalma camp between October 16 and 22, 2007.
<P></P>
Displaced women are at constant risk of rape when they venture outside their camps.  Although most rape victims accuse Janjawid militia, there are also reports of rape being committed by members of the Sudanese army, the Sudanese police and armed rebel groups. Women have also reported that they have been raped inside the camps.
<P></P>
"Mahmud," an internally displaced person in al-Jeneina, told Amnesty International: ”Women are still going out to collect firewood, which is a danger to them as they may be raped. But we men are still letting them go because the men who collect firewood may be killed."
<P></P>
Amnesty International has called on the UN-AU Mission in Darfur to ensure the protection of the internally displaced by stationing units near each camp and maintaining constant patrolling -- including accompanying women and others collecting firewood.
<P></P>
"UNAMID must be given the resources to fully ensure the protection of all civilians in Darfur," said Hondora. "In addition, all parties to the conflict must immediately stop attacking civilians and facilitate the deployment of UNAMID forces to all affected areas."
<P></P>
The conflict in Darfur has led to some of the worst human rights abuses imaginable, including systematic and widespread murder, rape, abduction and displacement. Since 2003, over 200,000 have died due to conflict-related causes, and more than 90,000 have been killed directly.
