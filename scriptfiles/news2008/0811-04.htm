WASHINGTON - August 11 - National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund Executive Director Rea Carey spoke today at an audio press conference about the Democratic National Platform, which was hosted by the National Stonewall Democrats and featured U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), a member of the Platform Committee. Carey talked about the historic significance of the proposed Democratic National Platform as it relates to issues impacting the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Statement by Rea Carey, Executive Director<br>

National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund</b></p>

<p>“The vision put forth in the 2008 Democratic National Platform is historic in its embrace of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Never before in our country’s history has there been a national party platform that is so inclusive of our entire community.</p>

<p>“It is a forward-looking platform in so many areas, including those relating to LGBT people. The Task Force Action Fund is certainly pleased to see that in the opening paragraph of the section titled ‘A More Perfect Union,’ for the first time the platform explicitly calls for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This demonstrates the success and unprecedented partnership between LGBT advocates and courageous public leaders, including Representative Baldwin, in educating the public and policymakers on the need for fully inclusive anti-discrimination protections.</p> 

<p>“The plank that includes a comprehensive Employment Non-Discrimination Act recognizes the LGBT community’s call for fully inclusive legislation, a critical element if we are to have legislation that protects all of us, equally.</p>  

<p>“Is the platform perfect? No. There is much more work to be done, especially to improve issues of family recognition. However, is it a good foundation? Unequivocally yes.”<br>
<br>
