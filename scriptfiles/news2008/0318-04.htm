<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 18 -"THEY WAVE THE FLAG WHEN YOU ATTACK--WHEN YOU COME HOME THEY TURN THEIR BACK"  In traditional march cadence, U.S. military veterans will chant that statement on the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, as they lead a Veterans' March for Peace to significant sites in Washington, DC, including the National Archives, home of the U.S. Constitution.  There veterans will conduct an action of "civil resistance" and issue Citizen Arrest Warrants for George Bush and Dick Cheney for multiple violations of the Constitution and international war crimes.
<P></P>
On Wednesday, March 19, members of Veterans For Peace (VFP) will gather on the National Mall, at 9:00 am, on 7th St., between Madison and Jefferson for a brief rally, followed by a silent march to the Museum of Native Americans, where Buffy St. Marie will join in a ceremony honoring the original inhabitants of the North American continent.
<P></P>
Army Col. (ret) Ann Wright, a VFP member, said, "This war has cost too many lives and resources that should have been spent on health, education and other needs.  The war must be stopped before more Iraqis and Americans are killed, and the sooner the better.  Our military presence in Iraq must end so Iraqis can begin to rebuild their lives."  The Veterans' March for Peace will continue to the Peace Monument on the grounds of the Capitol, where VFP members will confirm their Statement of Purpose which says in part: "We, having dutifully served our nation, do hereby affirm our greater responsibility to serve the cause of world peace.  To this end we will work with others to increase public awareness of the costs of war...(and) to abolish war as an instrument of national policy."
<P></P>
At 11:30 am, the Veterans March for Peace March stops at the National Archives, home of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution.  Here veterans will retake their military oath, the key part of which is: "I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic…"  In addition, they will serve Citizen Arrest Warrants for George Bush and Dick Cheney.
<P></P>
VFP President, Elliott Adams, explained why the warrants will be issued, saying, "It has long been apparent that our Constitution is under attack and has been deliberately and relentlessly undermined by domestic enemies -- indeed, by our highest government officials -- who took the same oath we did and have violated it by waging a war of aggression and committing war crimes in Iraq."
<P></P>
The Peace March will terminate at McPherson Square across from the Veterans' Administration Headquarters where a civil resistance action will highlight grievances over inadequate health care funding for veterans when they return home.
