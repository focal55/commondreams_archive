WASHINGTON - July 29 - A recent article from Arkansas Business reveals that not only did Wal-Mart deny its workers breaks at stores across the country, but also that Wal-Mart managers and executives received complaints and an audit revealing the widespread problem and chose to ignore it. A judge characterized Wal-Mart's response to documentation of these problems, saying they "put their heads in the sand."

"WakeUpWalMart.com has known all along that such a widespread problem was a matter of corporate culture and company-wide policy," said Meghan Scott, spokesperson for WakeUpWalMart.com. "Wal-Mart knowingly denied its employees breaks so that it could make a greater profit. Its managers and executives ignored audits and reports showing abuse of federal law to protect their bottom line. It is one of the most flagrant examples in Wal-Mart's long tradition of putting profit over people." <!-- #EndEditable -->
