June 11 - The US/Israel defense agreements were at the top of the agenda last week at AIPEC. Israel, a small nation surrounded by adversaries, relies on the United States' military aid in order to protect itself. Critics of this alliance argue that the US/Israel relationship has made it more difficult for the US and Iran to have a diplomatic relationship.
<P></P>
In an emotionally loaded speech before an AIPEC crowd, Congressman Kirk proposed a drastic doomsday scenario, justifying increased military presence in the Middle East. Said Kirk: "Sometimes I've talked about a nightmare morning, where you're brushing your teeth, your cell phone rings, it's your best friend on the phone and says, 'Quick, turn on CNN, turn it on right now, Israel doesn't exist, it was just wiped out in a salvo of missiles.'"
<P></P>
Ignoring the important NIE findings that "Iran will not be technically capable of producing and reprocessing enough plutonium for a weapon before about 2015", Kirk perpetuates the common fallacy that President Ahmedinejad's role in the Iranian hierarchy of power allows him control over military initiatives, and extrapolates that Iran poses an imminent threat.
<P></P>
By contrast, Larry Wilkerson, former Chief of Staff to Colin Powell, told The Real News: "I don't think the President of the United States should be negotiating with President Ahmedinejad. President Ahmedinejad occupies a position in the Iranian hierarchy of power which is largely ceremonial, he is not a very powerful president."
<P></P>
In an interview following Congressman Kirk's inflammatory statements, The Real News' Matt Palevsky takes a look at some of the truth behind the sensationalism.
