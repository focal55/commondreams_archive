<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 6 -  Results from the four states where Green Parties participated in the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries show a landslide for Ralph Nader in California (61%) and a lead among candidates for Cynthia McKinney in Arkansas and Illinois.<br>
<br>
The office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, responding to an inquiry, said that his state doesn't post unofficial results, and will not announce the numbers until absentee and overseas ballots are counted.  Some early returns from Boston and a few other cities show a near tie for Mr. Nader and Ms. McKinney, with Mr. Nader slightly ahead by a few votes, but too inconclusive to call.<br>
<br>
Ms. McKinney, a former Democratic US Representative from Georgia (now a Green), won the Illinois primary with a strong lead (57%).<br>
<br>
The Arkansas results currently show that over half (nearly 54%) of the state's Green voters decided to remain uncommitted.  Arkansas' totals have been delayed because of power outages after severe storms and tornadoes Tuesday evening while voting was still going on.<br>

<br>
Mr. Nader has not declared his candidacy, but recently announced the formation of an exploratory committee for a possible presidential run &lt;<a href="http://www.naderexplore08.org" target="_new">http://www.naderexplore08.org</a>&gt;.<br>
<br>
The Illinois Green Party is currently fielding reports of voting irregularities in Chicago and elsewhere in Illinois, with Green voters told by pollworkers on Tuesday that no Green Party ballots were available at their polling places, or that they had to vote on suspect electronic voting machines, even while other parties used paper ballots.  More information: <a href="http://www.gp.org/press/pr-state.php?ID=21" target="_new">http://www.gp.org/press/pr-state.php?ID=21</a><br>
<br>
After the Super Tuesday primaries, Green candidates will compete in the February 12 primary in the District of Columbia.  Currently, 21 state Green Parties hold ballot access within their respective states.  Some Green Parties chose presidential candidates by caucus voting and by election of national convention delegates at state party conventions.<br>
<br>
The Green Party will hold its 2008 national convention in Chicago from July 10 to 13.<br>
