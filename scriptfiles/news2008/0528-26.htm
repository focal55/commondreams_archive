CALIFORNIA - May 28 -  On Wednesday May 28th local peace groups are mobilizing vibrant protests&nbsp;for a big money fundraiser for John McCain’s presidential campaign and to greet him before he goes to bed at his hotel. The national peace organization CODEPINK is calling for demonstrations outside of his fundraiser at a private home in Bel-Air and later in the evening outside of the Beverly Hilton Hotel to protest McCain’s support of the Iraq war and his saber-rattling for attacking Iran. McCain is coming from a fundraising stint with President Bush in Phoenix, AZ where the events had to be relocated last minute due to low ticket sales and large-scale planned protests. </p>

    <br>“We're calling for Los Angeles peace and justice organizations to join our peace coalition to protest McCain’s policies: among them his egregious support to continue the war in Iraq and his saber-rattling for an attack on Iran. We will let him know that Americans want a leader who represents diplomacy, not endless war,” says CODEPINK cofounder, Jodie Evans of Los Angeles.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
