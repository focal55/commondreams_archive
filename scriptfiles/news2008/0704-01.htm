 July 4 - A recent New Yorker report by Seymour Hersh says that the Bush administration and US congress are planning covert operations against Iran. This, not long after The New York Times reported that Israeli war planes staged a major rehearsal for an attack on Iran. Hersh told CNN that he doesn't think "we can safely say that any military action is off the table no matter what happens."
<p></p>
Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, has dismissed the threat of an attack, insisting that the United States couldn't afford to open another front in the Middle East, and that Israel is in a state of too much internal turmoil. "The Israeli government is facing a political breakdown within itself and within the region," and as such, would not engage in such "craziness", Mottaki told reporters on Wednesday.  
<p></p>
Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff stated at the Pentagon that he has always been clear on the subject: "Opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful on us." He went on to say this doesn't mean the US military does not have capacity or reserve for such an endeavor, but that it would be very challenging and the consequences would be "difficult to predict". Mullen refused to say what Israeli leaders told him during meetings last week about any intentions to strike Iran. "Those are matters for the Israeli military and the Israeli government to address."
<p></p>
Director General of the IAEA, Mohamed el Baradei, told Al-Arabiya TV that a military strike would be worse than anything possible. It would "turn the region into a fireball," and prompt Iran to launch a crash course to build nuclear weapons with the blessing of all Iranians, even those in the West."
