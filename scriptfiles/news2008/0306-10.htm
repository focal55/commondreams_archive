<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 6 - The Interfaith Alliance criticized the Bush Administration for continuing to funnel tax dollars to fund religious education. As part of the “faith-based initiative,” the White House has announced that it will host a Summit on Inner-City Children and Faith-Based Schools, according to a March 4 Washington Times article. The Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance issued the following statement:
<p></p>
I am disturbed by news reports that the White House is pushing for more taxpayer money to be funneled to sectarian schools. While we recognize that religious schools provide an important service to students and families, they should only continue to do so with private dollars.
<p></p>
The Interfaith Alliance believes that public funds should not go to educational institutions that are allowed to discriminate against students and teachers based on religion. Vouchers create unnecessary entanglement between the institutions of religion and government. As we have since we were founded, we will fight in the halls of Congress and in our communities to ensure that voucher programs for sectarian schools are eliminated, not expanded.
<p></p>
