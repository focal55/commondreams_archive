WASHINGTON, DC - May 21 - Sarah Brady, honorary chair of the Brady Campaign and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement: <br>
<br>
<em>“Jim and I send Senator Kennedy, Vicki and the entire Kennedy family our love and warm wishes. It was great to see the Senator looking so strong and fit when he left the hospital this morning.” <br>
<br>
“Senator Kennedy has been an inspiration to Jim and me for many years.&nbsp; Publicly, he seems larger than life when you are with him.&nbsp; But privately, he is a man of great humility and kindness.&nbsp; Throughout the fight to pass the Brady Law, he worked feverishly behind the scenes, lobbying his colleagues, resolving dilemmas, but never wanting any credit. He deserves credit, though, because we never would have passed it without him - we wouldn’t have even gotten close.<br>
<br>

“Sitting on my windowsill is an orchid that Teddy and Vickie gave me two years ago.&nbsp; It is blooming now.&nbsp; I look at it and I know that Teddy will win this fight, as he has won so many in the past.”<br>
<br>
<br>
