MINNEAPOLIS - May 28 -  The National Conference for Media Reform -- the largest gathering of its kind in the country -- will bring thousands of activists, educators, policymakers and leaders from all 50 states to Minneapolis to discuss the future of media. </p>
<p>"The Twin Cities have been the epicenter of the debate over the future of media," said <strong>Josh Silver</strong>, executive director of Free Press, the national, nonpartisan media reform group that organizes the conference. "This community has experienced the damaging impact of consolidation -- but also the growth of a vibrant noncommercial, community and ethnic media sector. The National Conference for Media Reform is a chance for people from across the country to find out what's happening in the Twin Cities and for Minnesotans to see what's going on everywhere else." </p>
<p>The three-day weekend features speeches from legendary journalists <strong>Bill Moyers</strong> of PBS and <strong>Dan Rather</strong>, former anchor of CBS News; FCC Commissioners <strong>Michael Copps</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Adelstein</strong>; <strong>Arianna Huffington</strong> of <em>Huffington Post</em>; former talk-show host <strong>Phil Donahue</strong>; author <strong>Naomi Klein</strong>; and many more. </p>

<p>The event -- which runs June 6-8 at the Minneapolis Convention Center -- will also spotlight many Minnesota media makers, new media visionaries and grassroots leaders. Among the local highlights of the nearly 75 workshops, panels and films: </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>David Schimke</strong> of the <em>Utne Reader</em>, <strong>Jeremy Iggers</strong> from the Twin Cities Media Alliance, <strong>Kathy Magnuson</strong> of <em>Minnesota Women's Press</em>, <strong>Sarah Lutman</strong> from Minnesota Public Radio, and <strong>Vickie Evans-Nash</strong> from the <em>Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder</em> look at the future of media in <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39035">"Minnesota Model" </a><br>

</li><li> <strong>Jim Pagliarini</strong> of Twin Cities Public Television examines the effects of today's technology and policy on tomorrow's content in <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39008">"New Directions in Public Media"</a><br>
</li><li> Local blogger <strong>Robin Marty</strong> and <strong>Paul Schmelzer</strong> of the <em>Minnesota Monitor</em> discuss <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39034">"The Netroots: What's Next?"</a> and <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39033">"The Changing Role of Media Critics"</a><br>

</li><li> Minnesota Public Radio's <strong>Michael Skoler</strong> explores how technology is changing journalism in <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39036">"New Media, New Models, New Journalism"</a><br>
</li><li> <strong>Mario Duarte</strong> of <em>La Prensa de Minnesota</em> will explore the growing influence of <a href="//www.freepress.net/node/39023">"Spanish-Language Media"</a><br>
</li><li> <strong>Edwin Okong'o</strong> of <em>MShale</em> and <strong>Zuag Kimberly Chang</strong> of <em>Hmong Today</em> talk about ethnic media in <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39049">"The Fighting Press"</a><br>

</li><li> <strong>Brandon Benavides</strong>, news producer for KSTP-TV 5, examines the media's coverage of LGBT issues in <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39066">"Purple Politics" </a><br>
</li><li> <strong>Joel Kramer</strong>, editor and CEO of MinnPost.com and former publisher of the Star Tribune, explores the state of the newspaper industry in <a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/39037">"Newspapers: Not Dead Yet?"</a>
</li></ul>
<p>"The Internet is damaging the traditional advertising-based business model that has supported so much journalism," said Kramer. "At the same time, the Internet is creating exciting opportunities to engage far more people in reporting on and analyzing what's happening in their communities and beyond. This conference is a great opportunity to see what people are doing and to talk about what might be possible in this new media world." </p>
