<p>CHICAGO - March 13 - ACORN members protested Tuesday at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s Nonprime and Specialty Lenders Conference being held at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago.  ACORN members demanded that the MBA and its members agree to a set of best practices in the origination and servicing practices of lenders to help prevent widespread foreclosures and vacant homes in communities across the country.  
<p></p>
“We need immediate action” said ACORN leader Julie Smith. “The lending industry was allowed free reign to prey on borrowers. We need fast action to even the playing field and give borrowers a fighting chance to save their homes.”
<p></p>
ACORN wants reforms that will help people like Sadie Booker, an 82-year old woman from Cleveland who began to fall behind on her loan when she was laid off from her job.  She began to work two jobs, but was not able to bring her loan current.  She fell further and further behind on her loan until the mortgage company was about to auction her property through a sheriff's sale.  Through the help of ACORN Housing, she was able to get her loan modified, which brought her loan current and required only a small down payment of $1000.  She is now able to keep her payments up and keep her home.
<p></p>
ACORN wants the MBA and its members to agree to four immediate actions to keep people like Ms. Booker in their homes: permanent loan modifications to make home mortgages affordable; ban payment options that increase debt of homeowners (option ARMS with minimum payments based on negative amortization); demand brokers work in the best interest of the consumer to get them the lowest cost loan possible; and support bankruptcy code reform to keep families in their homes.
<p></p>
Also on Tuesday, more than 350 ACORN members from around the country staged a “Save Our Homes/Stop Foreclosures” rally at West Lawn of the Capitol as part of the national grassroots community organization’s annual Legislative and Political Conference.
