MINNEAPOLIS - May 20 - A Bush Administration interagency working group is pushing a flawed import
food safety system that prioritizes trade considerations over public health, finds a new report
by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP).<p></p>
The report, “Import Food Safety in the Twilight of the Bush Administration” (at www.iatp.
org) by IATP’s Steve Suppan, analyzes the recommendations of the Interagency Working
Group on Import Safety—established by the Bush Administration following a series of recalls
of contaminated and hazardous pet foods and toys imported from China last year. U.S. food
imports are projected to greatly expand in the next decade. About 60 percent of fruits and
vegetables, and 75 percent of seafood currently consumed in the U.S. are imported.<p></p>
Many of the IWG’s 14 recommendations and 50 action steps are designed to reduce import
inspection and testing and instead emphasize safety certification of foreign export facilities,
the report found. The IWG recommendations rely largely on exporters and importers to implement
voluntary prevention controls against food and feed contamination. This approach
extrapolates internationally the highly criticized U.S. food safety management system whose
breakdowns resulted in large meat product recalls in 2007, culminating in the February 2008
recall of 143 million pounds of ground beef.<p></p>
“The IWG report prioritizes the trade objectives of the food industry, rather than ensuring a
safer food supply for consumers,” said Suppan. “Many of the regulatory tools proposed by the
IWG have exposed U.S. consumers to unsafe or potentially unsafe food when implemented
domestically. The Administration’s proposal was developed with the help of industry to avoid
greater rates of physical inspection and testing. This off-shoring and outsourcing of product
safety provides another layer of plausible deniability for corporate liability prevention.”
The Bush Administration approach shifts some legal responsibility for U.S. import safety from
U.S. agencies and importers to foreign exporters. A new Administration should instead more
tightly regulate the importing companies over which the U.S. government has jurisdiction,
the report recommends.<p></p>
“Fortunately, there are steps that the next Administration could take to prioritize public
health and greatly improve the safety of our food,” said Suppan. The report’s recommendations
for the next Administration include:<p></p>
• Increasing the number of inspectors at our ports with better inspection technology;<br>

• Allowing regulators to limit the number of ports of entry for high risk products;<br>

• Allowing regulators to suspend import licenses for repeated failure to comply with food
safety and other import rules;<br>

• Incentivizing importer compliance with import requirements by establishing an importer
performance bond that would be reimbursable according to the importer’s compliance rate.<p></p>
