<p>NEW YORK - May 8 - American Civil Liberties Union members from Alaska to New York and every state in between will converge on the nation’s capital from June 8 through 10 to meet with and hear from some of the nation's top political leaders and policymakers at the 2008 ACLU Membership Conference, “Stand Up For Freedom.” Members of the media are invited to attend and take advantage of opportunities including one-on-one interviews with some of our speakers, performers and top ACLU staff.
<p></p>
Confirmed speakers include Arthur Chaskalson, former Chief Justice of South Africa; Ariel Dorfman, the Chilean-American author who Time called a “literary grandmaster”; Alex Gibney, Oscar-winning director of Taxi to the Dark Side; Kal Penn, actor and producer who starred in the Harold & Kumar movies and The Namesake; Arianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post; John Hutson, former Judge Advocate General of the Navy; and ACLU leaders, experts, bloggers, celebrities and others. The band Ozomatli, famous for fusing hip hop with Latin rhythms and funk, will perform at the evening gala.
<p></p>
Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter will attend the closing session of the conference, a celebratory luncheon for ACLU President Nadine Strossen. Music legend John Hiatt is scheduled to perform, and several special guests will be on hand to honor Strossen’s remarkable work and tireless devotion to the defense of civil liberties.
<p></p>
During the intensive three-day conference, ACLU members will attend workshops on the ACLU's agenda with Washington legislative and legal staffs; lobby members of Congress to support ACLU efforts; and question top federal officials and other Washington insiders about where they stand on civil liberties issues.
