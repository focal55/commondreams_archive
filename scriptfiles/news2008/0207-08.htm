<p>Cordova, Alaska - February 7 -Victims of the Exxon
Valdez oil spill have launched "The Whole Truth" campaign,
http://www.wholetruth.net, in support of the over 32,000 fishermen, women
and Alaska Natives suing Exxon to recover damages for economic harm caused
by the spill. Nearly two decades after the spill caused irreparable damage
to the environment and the economy of Prince William Sound, Exxon has taken
its fight to avoid responsibility all the way to the Supreme Court, where
oral arguments are scheduled for February 27. While there is no dispute
that the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill is one of our nation's worst environmental
disasters, Exxon has waged a shameless fight to escape responsibility. "The
Whole Truth" campaign is meant to insure that the truth about the
irreparable economic damage done to the communities of Prince William Sound
be known, and that Exxon finally be held accountable.
<P></P>


    "After the spill, Exxon promised to make the people and communities of
Prince William Sound whole again," said Steve Reidel of Cordova District
Fishermen United (CDFU). "That never happened. Nineteen years later after
nearly two decades of broken promises it is finally time for Exxon to take
responsibility and make amends for this catastrophe. Justice demands it."

<P></P>

    This year marks the nineteenth anniversary of the worst oil spill in
American history. Exxon placed Captain Joseph Hazelwood, a known alcoholic,
in command of its 1000 foot supertanker, the Exxon Valdez, despite nearly
three years of reports that the captain was a heavy drinker. Predictably,
Hazelwood was drunk as the tanker left port carrying 53 million gallons of
crude oil on board. His estimated blood alcohol level at the time of
departure was .241, more than 3 times the current legal limit in most
states to operate a vehicle. After setting out he steered the tanker away
from the shipping lane, set it on autopilot, and left the bridge. He left a
fatigued third mate who was not qualified to navigate through the complex
waters of Prince William Sound in charge to execute a tricky maneuver and
avoid Bligh Reef. On March 24, 1989 the Exxon Valdez ran aground and
ruptured 8 of its 11 tanks, leading to untold billions of dollars in damage
to the economy and untold damage to the Sound's environment, which has
never fully recovered.

<P></P>

    "The fishermen, Native people and citizens of Prince William Sound are
speaking with one voice, and the message to Exxon is clear. Take
responsibility for what you've done. After nearly 20 years of spin,
evasion, and litigation the time has come to hold Exxon accountable and let
polluters know that they are not above the law. This is the only way we can
protect our nation's waters," said Jennifer Gibbins, Executive Director of
Prince William Soundkeeper and one of the principles of The Whole Truth
Campaign.
<P></P>


    After three days of almost no response, Exxon finally began a clean-up
effort but the oil had already spread too far and was beyond containment.
The recovery effort was a charade. In a taped conversation, Exxon's
representative explained: "....[there] needs to be something out there that
looks like an effort is being made." A Congressional report determined that
Exxon's response was "wholly inadequate." Ultimately, only 14 percent of
the oil was reclaimed. With the fear of oil contamination the State of
Alaska was forced to close the fishery for the 1989 season. The following
years were met by reduced harvests and depressed fish prices. 1300 miles of
private shoreline was damaged some of which remains oiled today. The spill
destroyed many subsistence activities of Natives in the area. The economy
of the region was crippled, the effects of which are still felt today.

<P></P>

    "It is very difficult to articulate the full impact, and more
specifically, the losses associated with the Exxon Valdez oil spill," said
Travis Vlasoff, a local fisherman in the Native Village of Tatitlek and
Project Analyst, Tatitlek Corporation. "The effects to the Native Village
of Tatitlek were no less than a complete and utter destruction of countless
traditional practices."
<P></P>


    "We lost everything," said Mike Webber, a highly respected native
commercial fisherman from a Cordova fishing family, who carved a Shame
Pole, a traditional totem pole carved to ridicule wealthy people who have a
debt to society, to mark the 18th anniversary of the spill. "Our economy
has never been the same since. Now, while Exxon racks up multi-billion
dollar profits, sometimes in a single quarter, we've been left to fight
them for what they owe us for nearly 20 years."
<P></P>


    On February 27, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in what has
amounted to a near 20-year effort by Exxon to shirk financial
responsibility for its actions. The Fishermen and Native Subsistence
lawsuit for private economic damages arose after Exxon refused to pay for
most of the harm caused. This suit is a class action composed of 32,677
commercial fishermen, related individuals and businesses, private
landowners, Native Alaskans, municipalities, and other claimants from
across the country. The 83 day jury trial began in 1994 after years of
discovery. It proceeded in three phases:

<P></P>

    In phase I the jury found that Exxon and Hazelwood had been reckless.

<P></P>

    In phase II the jury awarded fishermen in the major commercial
fisheries $287 million in compensatory damages for economic harm. Under
maritime law, some economic and other types of injury were barred. Outside
of phase II other victims recovered economic damages that exceeded $500
million.
<P></P>


    In phase III the jury was asked to determine whether Exxon and
Hazelwood were liable for punitive damages and if so whether punitive
damages should be awarded. The jury returned a verdict against Hazelwood
for $5000 and against Exxon for $5 billion dollars.

<P></P>

    Exxon appealed, and in 2001 the Ninth Circuit court of appeals affirmed
the compensatory verdict and the jury's decision to award punitive damages.
On remand the District Court found the $5 billion dollar award was
justified but given the Court's evolving law with regard to punitive
damages it reduced the award to $4.5 billion. Once again Exxon appealed. On
December 22, 2006 a divided Ninth Circuit reduced the award to $2.5
billion. Exxon again challenged that ruling but the court refused to hear
the case. On August 20, 2007 Exxon filed a writ of certiorari with the
United States Supreme Court. On October 29, 2007 the Court agreed to hear
the case. Oral arguments are set for February 27, 2008. The nineteenth
anniversary of the spill is one month later, March 24.

<P></P>

    On January 29, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin announced that the State of
Alaska filed an amicus, or "friend of the court," brief supporting the
award of punitive damages against Exxon. In a statement, Attorney General
Talis Colberg said, "Exxon's arguments, if they prevail, would not only
deny Alaskans compensation to which they are due, but would reduce the
incentive for those who use our coastal waters to operate in a careful and
safe manner."

<P></P>

    At issue in this case is the $2.5 billion dollar punitive damage
verdict, awarded by a jury to punish Exxon for its irresponsible corporate
conduct and recklessness that caused the spill. Although this award breaks
down to merely $76,500 per individual plaintiff, Exxon argues that it
should not be punished at all. The Whole Truth campaign seeks to provide
the complete truth about the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, generate public
awareness and support to end Exxon's quest to escape responsibility.

    ABOUT THE WHOLE TRUTH

<P></P>

    The Whole Truth campaign is supported by leading Alaska advocacy
organizations Prince William Soundkeeper and Cordova District Fishermen
United. Native and commercial fishermen are available to speak to their
direct personal experiences as victims of the fall-out of the Exxon Valdez
Oil Spill. Audio clips of statements from local fishermen, women and
natives impacted by the spill are also available for b-roll purposes. To
speak to them, their attorneys or for the latest statistical findings on
the economic damage suffered by the people of Prince William Sound, contact
Aric Caplan at 301-770-0550 or go to http://www.wholetruth.net.
