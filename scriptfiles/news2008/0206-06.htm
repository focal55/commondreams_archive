<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 6 - <em>The 
following is a statement by Jamie Rappaport Clark, executive vice president of 
Defenders of Wildlife, and former director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
in the Clinton administration, responding to the sale of 30 million acres of oil 
and gas leases in polar bear habitat in the Chukchi Sea.</em> 
</p><p>“The Bush administration’s delay in listing the 
polar bear as a threatened species, while going forward with the sale of 30 
million acres of oil and gas leases in polar bear habitat in the Chukchi Sea, 
makes clear that this administration is more interested in catering to its 
friends in the oil and gas industry than saving endangered species or stopping 
global warming.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Geological Survey reported last year 
that if we continue with business as usual, there will be no more polar bears in 
Alaska by 2050.&nbsp; 
More oil and gas development in the Arctic means more greenhouse gas pollution, further 
melting the sea-ice pack on which polar bears depend.&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoting more oil and gas 
development while failing to protect polar bears and address global warming is a 
bankrupt policy from an administration that shows no concern for what kind of 
world we will leave our children.”&nbsp; </p><p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/programs_and_policy/wildlife_conservation/imperiled_species/polar_bear/index.php" target="_new">Read more</a> about the polar bear.
