WASHINGTON, DC - May 15 -Boots-on-the-ground veterans are testifying before Congress on Thursday about the effects of the Iraq occupation. This testimony, presented by veterans who have witnessed firsthand the devastation of Iraq and its people, comes on the same day that Congress is expected to debate a bill extending funding for the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan through 2009.<br>
<br>
<br>
On Thursday, May 15, members of Iraq Veterans Against the War will testify before members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Before members of Congress vote to provide more funding they need to hear about the true costs of the occupation of Iraq from those who have experienced it first-hand. Congress has heard from the Generals and the politicians -- now it's time they heard from the troops," said Kelly Dougherty, Executive Director of IVAW and former Military Police Sergeant.<br>
<br>
<br>
Winter Soldier on the Hill is taking place two months after Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan, a four-day summit where hundreds of members of IVAW gathered to present testimony about their military experiences to the public. It is being held Thursday, May 15, 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at 2261 Rayburn House Office Building.<br>

<br>
<br>
Further information including a list of those testifying is at <a href="http://ivaw.org">ivaw.org</a>. The proceedings are expected to be carried live by <a href="http://inside.c-spanarchives.org:8080/cspan/schedule.csp">C-Span3</a>.<br>
