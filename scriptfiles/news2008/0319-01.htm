<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 19 - In recognition of World Water Day (March 22), Water Advocates calls for the implementation of more safe drinking water and sanitation projects in developing countries. While recognizing the important work that has been done, to meet the global challenge there remains an acute need to ratchet-up actions by governments, corporations, foundations, the media, as well as the civic and faith-based community.

 
 <P></P>

"Each day 4,500 children die around the world due to mostly preventable water and sanitation- related diseases," said David Douglas, President of Water Advocates. "That's about 135,000 lives per month—a small city's worth of children— an ongoing disaster by anyone's standards."

 
 <P></P>

The good news is something can be done. Organizations exist that have experience implementing sustainable water and sanitation projects. They have been quietly working for years on this issue—under the radar—saving and improving the lives of the world's poorest citizens.

 

 <P></P>
"We don't have to wait for a cure, what is needed is more financial support, public awareness, and political will, continued David Douglas. "We encourage U.S. citizens to support sustainable drinking water and sanitation projects through their own religious or civic organizations, or through nonprofit organizations working to implement effective projects in this field."

 <P></P>

This World Water Day, Water Advocates is circulating a list (also available on their <a href="http://www.wateradvocates.org" target="_new">website</a>) of 42 U.S. organizations helping to implement safe drinking water and sanitation projects in developing countries. We encourage the media to publish this list—in the same way it publishes similar lists during a natural disaster—to allow the U.S. public to involve itself in addressing this silent, ongoing disaster.<!-- #EndEditable -->
