<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 11 - Today, January 11, marks the 6th anniversary of Guantanamo Bay Prison.  Activists from all over the world are coming together to call for the facility to be immediately closed, the detained to be granted their right of Habeas Corpus, and the war crimes committed in the illegal prison to be tried in an international court.
<p></p>
The keystone event is happening in Washington, DC where protesters from the <a href="http://www.studentpeaceaction.org/" target="_new">Student Peace Action Network</a>, donning orange jumpsuits, will demonstrate water-boarding torture techniques and Peace Action protesters will symbolically bury the right to Habeas Corpus. 
<p></p>
Other events, from London to North Carolina, are also underway.  Peace Action Affiliates will focus their efforts on community education as well as protest.  On the North Shore they organized a screening of the critically acclaimed film:  Meeting Resistance by Steve Connors and Molly Bingham.  Dallas Peace Action is focusing their events on freedom and justice in the Presidents former backyard. 
<p></p>
Since Guantanamo first opened Peace Action has been a vocal opponent to both it and the people who conceived it.  As the largest grassroots peace & disarmament organization, representing the diverse views of our nation, we called for the resignation of Alberto Gonzales and an investigation into U.S. secret prisons, like Guantanamo, worldwide.  Since then Gonzales and others have resigned but the illegal prisons remain.  Peace Action continues to stand in opposition to this oppressive Administration.
<p></p>
"Guantanamo symbolizes the worst hypocrisy of our nation" Says Peace Action Executive Director Kevin Martin. "While claiming to push for democracy and freedom abroad the administration is violating international laws and American values."
<p></p>
Peace Action & Peace Action Education Fund, with 180,000 supporters and over 100 chapters in 34 states, works to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons and promote government spending priorities that support human needs. We believe that war is not a suitable reaction to conflict and we are driven by our devotion to humanity to promote peace and justice above the status quo.
