<p>NEW YORK, NY - May 6 -  On Thursday May 8, 2007, an organization of domestic violence survivors, their supporters and advocates will hold a press conference on the steps of City Hall in Manhattan to release a new report that reveals the ways in which Family Court in New York City is a broken system that is often stacked against domestic violence survivors to the point that it can endanger survivors and their children.  Timed to coincide with Mother’s Day, the survivors will call for more transparency and accountability in the Family Court system.

  <P></P>

The report, Justice Denied: How Family Courts in NYC Endanger Battered Women and Children was prepared by the Voices of Women Organizing Project, a grassroots organization of survivors of domestic violence who work to improve services for battered women. It illustrates a pattern of bias against women, particularly domestic violence survivors and shows how systemic disregard for the law and the courts own procedures for law guardians and judges often results in custody decisions that compromise the safety of children.
