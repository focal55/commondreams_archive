NEW YORK - August 7 - Former President Jimmy Carter issued a statement in support of the American Civil Liberties Union’s John Adams Project, a partnership with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) that provides civilian legal teams to assist under-resourced military counsel of Guantánamo detainees who have been charged in the military commissions.
<p></p>
“I applaud efforts of the ACLU and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to ensure that the principles of our country are not compromised and the Guantánamo detainees are afforded a fair trial with basic rights of due process,” said President Carter in his statement.
<p></p>
President Carter joins a pantheon of respected military and civilian leaders who have endorsed the project, including former Attorney General Janet Reno, former CIA and FBI Director William Webster, Retired Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, Lt. Colonel Stuart Couch and families of 9/11 victims.
<p></p>
“It is a tremendous honor to have the support of President Carter and it is a testament to the importance of this project,” said Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU. “We will continue to fight for justice and raise awareness of the fundamental flaws of this unlawful system. Guantánamo and its military commissions represent a stain on this country's reputation. It is time to put an end to this debacle and make a fresh start in a system that reflects America’s core values.”
