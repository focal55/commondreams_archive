WASHINGTON - July 11 -“I am pleased that the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is working hard to bring those most responsible for the genocide in Darfur to justice.  Accountability for the horrific human rights abuses in Darfur is an essential step toward peace and reconciliation.  I am hopeful that these indictments, along with a comprehensive strategy, can help expedite a political resolution ending the genocide.  At the same time, we must recognize that the conflict is Darfur is ongoing and the potential for backlash by the Sudanese government against peacekeepers, humanitarian workers and civilians is very real.  Such retaliation could have devastating consequences not only in Darfur and neighboring Chad, but also in southern Sudan where peace remains fragile.  I urge the Bush Administration and the rest of the international community to call for calm in the wake of these indictments.”
