<p>NATIONWIDE - March 24 -The 5th Anniversary of the war in Iraq passed last week and another tragic anniversary is already here- the 4,000th US Military death. CODEPINK Women for Peace, a national, women-lead peace organization will be holding vigils across the country Monday and Tuesday. Cofounders Medea Benjamin and Jodie Evans are available for comment and interview. At noon on Monday in Berkeley, CA- the site of the ongoing vigil outside of the infamous Berkeley Marine Recruiting Station- CODEPINK will begin their vigil to honor the 4,000 dead.
<P></P>
Last week CODEPINK participated in mass mobilizations and non-violent acts of civil disobedience in the heart of Washington, D.C. to protest the war and those who profit from it. CODEPINK has also been in the halls of Congress everyday since last March pressuring Members of Congress to defund the occupation in Iraq and establish a timeline for withdrawal.
<P></P>
CODEPINK co-founder Medea Benjamin states, "As our Congress continues to play party politics 4,000 US service men and women have died in Iraq. As long as the injustices committed by our government continue, peace activists will honor the dead by protesting in the streets, in the offices of our elected representatives and in hundreds of cities across the nation. The precious time we spend away from our families and our homes is small in comparison to the sacrifice of our men and women serving in the military and innocent civilians that have lost their own lives or have lost family members."
<P></P>
CODEPINK is a women-initiated grassroots peace and social justice movement working to end the war in Iraq, stop new wars, and redirect our resources into healthcare, education and other life-affirming activities.
