DENVER - August 12 - Progressive Democrats of America and The Nation magazine are teaming up to host "Progressive Central," a five-day gathering for activists, journalists and DNC delegates during DNC week in downtown Denver.
<P></P>
The event, running from Sunday night, August 24 through Thursday, August 28, will be held at Central Presbyterian Church, 1660 Sherman St.
<P></P>
The five-day lineup of more than 20 panel discussions, with topics ranging from health care and election reform to the future of progressive politics, will feature such prominent speakers as Democratic Congressional Representatives Barbara Lee, Calif., John Conyers, Mich., Lynn Woolsey, Calif., and Robert Wexler, Fl., plus such other well-known activists as Katrina vanden Heuvel, Tom Hayden, Jim Zogby, Medea Benjamin and Jim Hightower.
<P></P>
"Progressive Central will be a progressive oasis, where like-minded people will meet to network, share ideas, learn from the country's foremost progressives, and help build the progressive movement," said Tim Carpenter, national director of Progressive Democrats of America, a Political Action Committee that is not formally affiliated with the Democratic Party.
<P></P>
After the Sunday night 8 p.m.-10 p.m. opening panel, the Monday-Thursday daytime schedule will include visiting time with fellow progressives, 10-11 a.m.; admission-free panels hosted by The Nation, 11 a.m.-12:30; lunch, 12:30 p.m.-1 p.m.; and two PDA-hosted panels, 1 p.m.-4 p.m.
<P></P>
A complete schedule of events and speakers is available at the PDA website, http://pdamerica.org. A week-long pass (suggested donation $125) and tickets for individual PDA events (suggested donation $10 per day), as well as $12.50 box-lunch reservations, may be purchased in advance on the website or on-site before the various events, space permitting. During Convention week, PDA volunteers and staffers will be visiting hotels hosting DNC delegates to personally invite them to visit Progressive Central.
<P></P>
Progressive Central is accessible by public transit, including the 16th Street shuttle, whose final stop at Broadway brings attendees to within easy walking distance of the site. Paid parking is also available near the site.
<P></P>
Laura Bonham, PDA's Communications Coordinator, noted: "Progressive Central will be a hive of activity. With The Nation, we have brought together some of the country’s foremost progressive minds--members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, independent media, and national and local activists--to discuss some of today’s hottest issues. We’ll offer space to learn, relax, and meet people It’s going to be a wonderful happening."
<P></P>
"When Progressive Democrats of America launched in Roxbury during the 2004 DNC Convention, our hope was to help build the progressive movement, both inside and outside the Democratic Party," Carpenter noted. "It’s four years later, and we are better organized, better focused, and well on our way to achieving our goal. We’ve planned a great event and hope the visitors to Progressive Central will experience progressive community building at its best."

About Progressive Democrats of America. Progressive Democrats of America was founded in 2004 to transform the Democratic Party and the country. It seeks to build a party and government controlled by citizens, not corporate elites -- with policies that serve the broad public interest, not just private interests. As a grassroots Political Action Committee (PAC) operating inside the Democratic Party, and outside in movements for peace and justice, PDA played a key role in the electoral victory of November 2006. Its inside/outside strategy is guided by the belief that a lasting majority will require a revitalized Democratic Party built on firm progressive principles.
<P></P>
Among its many lobbying activities, PDA led a campaign to have a "guaranteed health care for all" plank included in the Democratic Party Platform. That effort, which was begun in late July, has gained the formal support of more than 450 DNC delegates.
<P></P>
About The Nation. Founded in 1865 and America's longest-running weekly publication, The Nation, based in New York City, is a leading voice in the progressive political movement. It is based in New York City.
