WASHINGTON - July 25 -  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it will not
establish safety standards for 11 contaminants in drinking water.
Environmental Working Group¹s Vice President for Research, Jane Houlihan,
issued the following statement.
<P></P>

³It¹s outrageous that EPA continues to allow public exposure to potentially
harmful chemicals. Our analysis of nationwide tap water found almost 100
percent compliance with enforceable health standards on the part of the
nation's water utilities. The problem, however, is EPA's failure to
establish enforceable health standards and monitoring requirements for
scores of widespread tap water contaminants.
<P></P>
Our analysis clearly demonstrates the need for greater protection of the
nation's tap water supplies, and for increased health protections from a
number of pollutants that are commonly found but currently unregulated.
Utilities routinely go beyond what is required to protect consumers from
these contaminants, but they need more money for testing, and for protection
of vital source waters."
<P></P>
Environmental Working Group¹s analysis of tap water in 42 states is
available online at <a href="http://www.ewg.org/sites/tapwater/findings.php" target="_new">http://www.ewg.org/sites/tapwater/findings.php<br>
