<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 17 - Today the International Fund for Animal Welfare (<a href="http://www.ifaw.org" target="_new">www.ifaw.org</a>) released On Thin Ice: The Precarious State of Arctic Marine Mammals in the United States Due to Global Warming, a comprehensive report commissioned to gauge the effects of unprecedented climate change on polar bears and other ice-dependent marine mammals within the United States.
<p></p>
“Signs of climate change are all around us,” said IFAW D.C. Office Director Jeff Flocken. “This is especially significant in the Artic, where ice habitat is integral to polar bears and melting sea-ice sets the stage for drastic population reductions. Ultimately, this will lead to the extinction of the species.”
 <p></p>
In September 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) released a series of reports concluding that by 2050, we will have lost two-thirds of the world’s polar bears, and that many of the rest will be gone by 2100. On Thin Ice provides information to decision-makers, the general public, and other interested parties about the threats currently facing ice-dependent marine mammals and how their habitat is being negatively impacted by global climate change.
 <p></p>
“Immediate actions are needed by individuals, by the Bush Administration, and by Congress to reverse the current trends that contribute to global warming,” said Flocken.  “The very existence of polar bears, walruses, and Arctic seals and whales are at stake.”
