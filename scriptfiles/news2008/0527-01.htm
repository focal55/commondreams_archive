May 27 - US Sergeant Corey Glass is now the first Iraq war deserter facing deportation from Canada. Last week his application to stay in the country was rejected. "I appeal to the Canadian people and the Canadian government, to honor their tradition of respect for human rights and support my decision not to participate in this unjust war," he later told the media. 
<p></p>
Lee Zaslofsky, National Coordinator of The War Resisters Campaign in Canada, says Sergeant Glass's case is not unique. In December 2007, The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration passed a motion calling on the Canadian government to implement a program allowing conscientious objectors to apply for permanent residence in Canada, and to cease any removal or deportation actions applied to such individuals. The motion has not yet been passed by Parliament.
<p></p>
Toronto lawyer, Jeffrey House, says the court system does not allow soldiers to question the legality of the war, and as such the "main argument" and the "main reason" that US soldiers put forward in refusing to continue fighting in Iraq is being kept out of the court system, which "tears the heart out of the argument". According to Courage to Resist, at least thirty soldiers have been imprisoned for refusing to fight in the Iraq war.
