<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 21 -  Today the Bush 
administration finalized its controversial decision to remove the northern 
Rockies gray wolf from the 
list of species protected under the Endangered Species Act. The delisting will 
take effect 30 days after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) publishes the 
final rule in the Federal Register next week.
</p><p>The removal of 
federal protections for the gray wolf puts its continued survival in the 
northern Rockies at the mercy of the woefully insufficient state management 
plans developed by Wyoming, Idaho and—to a lesser extent—Montana.&nbsp; These plans call for dramatic reductions 
in wolf populations in the region.</p>
<p>“We will support delisting of 
the northern Rockies wolf when the states establish 
sustainable management plans that ensure viable, interconnected wolf populations 
throughout the region,” said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of 
Wildlife. “Unfortunately, the current state plans seem designed to lead only to 
the dramatic decline and need for quick relisting of the wolf. That’s not in 
anyone’s best interest.” </p>
<p>Before a species can be 
delisted, FWS must determine that it does not face continued threats that could 
undermine the species’ survival. This criterion is not met under the state 
management plans which ignore scientific estimates that, for&nbsp;species to 
remain viable, there should be several thousand individuals, and 
wolf&nbsp;populations&nbsp;in the northern&nbsp;Rockies 
must&nbsp;be interconnected with larger wolf populations in 
Canada. With no 
federal protections in place, existing state management plans would permit wolf 
populations in the northern Rockies to be drastically 
reduced by as much as&nbsp;70 percent, and eliminate any likelihood of 
establishing connections with Canadian wolf populations or promoting the 
establishment of wolf populations in other states such as 
Oregon, 
Washington, 
Utah, and 
Colorado.</p>

<p>“Given the tremendous public 
support and resources spent to reintroduce the wolf to the northern Rockies, it 
makes no sense to allow wholesale killing of wolves in the region and polarize 
the issue even more deeply with this one-sided plan,” said Suzanne Stone, 
northern Rockies wolf conservation specialist for Defenders of Wildlife. 
“Instead we need a balanced solution based on science that also addresses the 
needs of ranchers, wildlife supporters, and hunters.”</p>
<p>Defenders of Wildlife recently 
joined with the Natural Resources Defense Council in <a href="http://www.defenders.org/resources/publications/programs_and_policy/wildlife_conservation/imperiled_species/wolf/petition_to_prepare_a_recovery_plan_for_the_gray_wolf.pdf" target="_new">petitioning FWS to develop 
a national recovery plan for wolves in the United States</a>, with regional recovery 
goals aimed at supporting sustainable populations of wolves in the northern 
Rockies, the northeast and the southwest. </p>
Background:<p>More than 200,000 gray wolves (Canis lupus) once lived throughout the 
United 
States. Aggressive wildlife killing campaigns led to 
wolf eradication from most of the country by the mid-1930s. Gray wolves have 
been listed as endangered since 1974, and were reintroduced to 
Yellowstone National 
Park and 
Central 
Idaho in 1995 and 1996. 
</p>
<p>Wolves are native to the northern 
Rockies and have begun once again to restore natural 
balance to the areas they are reoccupying, by culling weak and diseased elk, 
deer, and other prey, and dispersing elk more widely across their habitat and 
away from sensitive wetlands and meadows that suffer from overbrowsing. Elk 
populations still remain high, (more than 400,000 elk are present today in the 
region) and hunter harvest success remains as high as it was prior to the return 
of wolves. Ranchers are also successfully learning to reduce the limited wolf 
predation on livestock to manageable levels and are compensated for most known 
losses that do occur by Defenders or state compensation programs. Wolf-related 
tourism in the Yellowstone region has generated more than $35 million 
annually for local communities.<br></p>
