<p>NATIONWIDE - April 24 - As Congressional leaders meet behind closed doors to iron out the details of yet another supplemental war funding bill,  members of Military Families Speak Out are expressing anger and dismay at published reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. John Murtha, and other leaders who have previously spoken out against the war are preparing to put forward a bill funding the Iraq war for an entire year in an apparent effort to avoid a contentious debate in Congress in the run up to the November election.
<p></p>
 

Keri Wheelwright, a member of Military Families Speak Out from Fountain Hills, AZ and the wife of an Army officer currently serving in Iraq, said "My husband's deployment to Iraq has been the hardest sacrifice we've had to make as a military family, and it's especially hard to endure knowing that we were duped into this war in the first place.  It is the worst betrayal to watch Congressional leaders, who have spoken out against this war in the past, put their political calculations ahead of the well-being of our troops.

 <p></p>

"Senators and Representatives who say you’re opposed to this war -- you have the chance to right one of the biggest political blunders in the history of our country. Do not fall into the trap of believing this Administration when it says ‘funding this war is funding the troops.’ What I and other military families know only too well is that funding this war is killing our troops.  Take real leadership now by refusing to put forward a bill that continues to fund the war in Iraq and introduce a bill that funds the swift and safe return of our troops."

 <p></p>

Megan Brooker, a member of Military Families Speak Out from Portland, Oregon whose brother is a Specialist in the Army now serving his second tour of duty in Iraq, said "My brother was supposed to leave the Army this year, but will soon be stop-lossed and forced to remain in Iraq until his fifteen month tour is over.  It is infuriating to think that he could be forced to risk his life for another year because Congressional leaders who claim to oppose this war want to avoid controversial votes in the fall of an election year.

 <p></p>

"Stop taking the lives of our men and women of the armed forces for an unjust and illegal war. Stop causing irreparable physical and psychological injuries to our loved ones and the people of Iraq. Bring our troops home and do it NOW.  Why not truly support our troops for once, by bringing them safely home and taking care of them when they get here?"

 <p></p>

Members of Military Families Speak Out are available for interview -- including families with loved ones currently serving in Iraq, families whose loved ones have died as a result of this war, families of troops who have suffered physical and psychological injuries, and families of those awaiting deployment or re-deployment.
