WASHINGTON, DC - May 27 - The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7420573.stm">BBC</a> is reporting: "Ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter has said Israel has at least 150 atomic weapons in its arsenal.<br>
<br>
<br>
"The Israelis have never confirmed they have nuclear weapons, but this has been widely assumed since a scientist leaked details in the 1980s. ...<br>
<br>
<br>
"Mr. Carter gave the figure for the Israeli nuclear arsenal in response to a question on U.S. policy on a possible nuclear-armed Iran, arguing that any country newly armed with atomic weapons faced overwhelming odds." <br>

<br>
<b><a href="pbennis@ips-dc.org">PHYLLIS BENNIS</a></b><br>
A fellow at the <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org">Institute for Policy Studies</a>, Bennis said today: "Once again, Carter has shown that ex-presidents -- at least some -- have more courage than sitting officials at almost any level. Acknowledging what the whole world knows -- that Israel controls a powerful nuclear arsenal -- is an important contribution given the U.S.-driven lopsided discourse on Iran, which of course does not have a nuclear arsenal. Like our own, Israel's nuclear weapons remain a major provocation and major contributor to the nuclear and weapons of mass destruction arms race across the region."<br>
<br>
Bennis has written extensively on the Mideast as well as the United Nations. She just wrote the primer "<a href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/5025">Iran in the Crosshairs: How to Prevent Washington's Next War</a>."<!-- #EndEditable -->
