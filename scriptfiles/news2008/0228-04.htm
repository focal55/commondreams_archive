<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 28 - The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology today
announced its participation in the newly formed Internet Safety
Technical Task Force, created to examine technologies that might be
used to protect children from inappropriate material or contacts on
the Internet.

</p><p>
The task force, an outgrowth of an agreement between MySpace.com and
49 state Attorneys General, will focus on whether age verification and
other technologies can be used to keep children out of social
networking sites and sites aimed at adults, and keep adults out of
sites intended for minors only.
</p><p>
The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School will
coordinate the task force. CDT believes that the Berkman staff is well
qualified to lead the task force, and we look forward to working with
them to ensure that critical policy and legal questions are addressed.
</p><p>
"The task force is comprised of members with a mix of technical,
policy, civil liberties, and industry perspectives.  That is the right
approach," said CDT President Leslie Harris.  "CDT is pleased to take
its place at this important table.  However, while we look forward to
a thorough and rigorous study of the issues, our participation comes
with a healthy dose of skepticism."
</p><p>
CDT believes that technology tools in the hands of parents are a key
part of the online safety landscape; however, technologies, such as
age verification, that put Internet companies in the role of
gatekeeper, raise a host of legal and policy questions. These
questions have sweeping implications for the future of the Internet
and its millions of users worldwide.
</p><p>
Harris said that for the task force to be legitimate, it must ask not
only, "Can we build age verification technology that works," but also,
"should we?"
</p><p>
The implications of age verification technology go well beyond merely
acting as a digital bouncer; requiring all Internet users to prove
their age could cast a shadow over the core principles of an open and
innovative Internet.  "The potential negative impact of age
verification on privacy and free expression cannot be overlooked,"
said CDT General Counsel John Morris.  "The task force must consider
any technology’s effectiveness, what unintended consequences there
might be, and whether there are alternative solutions that could
address the same problems in less intrusive ways."
</p><p>
The complex issues the task force will have to confront include:
</p><ul><li>

How does a U.S.-based solution apply when minors try accessing
foreign-based web sites? 

</li><li>Who decides whether users or providers should bear the cost of 
implementing new age verification technologies? 

</li><li>Is it possible to have robust age verification but still protect privacy? 
</li><li>Would Internet users, regardless of age, be required to register and log 
in wherever they go? 

</li><li>Would the important, constitutionally protected, ability of anonymous 
access to information be undermined? 

</li><li>Would a minor’s personal information be stored on large databases 
belonging to private companies contracted for such work?  And what, if 
any, access would consumers have to that information?
 
</li><li>Would excluding minors from social networking sites violate their 
constitutional right to free speech? 

</li><li>Would age verification aimed at minors, but necessarily required 
of all users, pass constitutional scrutiny if it burdens the free 
expression of adults?</li></ul>
<p>
CDT believes that the new task force must acknowledge that the scope
of its investigation does not begin and end with a workable age
verification technology, but must also encompass legal and policy
issues.  "The most critical question is: What effect would age
verification have on the dynamic and innovative ways that both adults
and minors use the Internet?" said Harris.
