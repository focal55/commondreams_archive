<p>NEW YORK - May 5 - <span>Two weeks after a </span><span>New York Times</span><span>
story (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/washington/20generals.html" title="" target="_blank">4/20/08</a>) revealed a Pentagon propaganda campaign
that had been feeding talking points to TV military analysts, many of whom also
had ties to military contractors, the cable and broadcast networks that
employed these analysts have almost entirely failed to report this crucial news
story. </span><span>Fox</span><span> has even continued to feature commentary by two
Pentagon-affiliated ex-generals without disclosing their conflicts of interest.</span><br>

<br>
<span>In the wake of the </span><span>New York Times</span><span>
story and resulting calls for a congressional inquiry into the Pentagon pundits
scandal, the Pentagon has announced that it has temporarily halted the program
(</span><span>New York Times</span><span>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/26/washington/26analyst.html" title="" target="_blank">4/26/08</a>). Citing his concern that the article had
raised "allegations that the Defense Department's relationship with the
retired military analysts was improper," Defense Department spokesperson
Robert Hastings told Stars &amp; Stripes (<a href="http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=61696&amp;archive=true" title="" target="_blank">4/26/08</a>) that he had directed his staff "to
suspend the activities that may be ongoing with retired military analysts to
give me time to review the situation."</span><br>
<br>
<span>The media organizations most implicated in
facilitating the Pentagon's propaganda program have been far less responsive.
The networks and cable outlets refused a request to address the issue on </span><span>PBS</span><span>; as the </span><span><span>NewsHour</span><span>'s</span></span><span> Judy Woodruff stated (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june08/tvgenerals_04-24.html" title="" target="_blank">4/24/08</a>), "We invited </span><span>Fox News</span><span>, </span><span>CNN</span><span>, </span><span>MSNBC</span><span>, </span><span>CBS</span><span>, </span><span>ABC</span><span> and </span><span>NBC</span><span> to participate,
but they declined our offer or did not respond." The cable and broadcast
networks have yet to respond to <span>FAIR's</span> request that
they change their practices to ensure that their audience will never again get
official talking points passed off as independent analysis.</span><br>

<br>
<span>Only </span><span>NPR</span><span> (</span><span>NPR.org</span><span>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/ombudsman/2008/04/npr_new_york_times_and_sourcin_1.html#more" title="" target="_blank">4/28/08</a>) has publicly stated that they have new
policies in place to ensure more careful vetting of analysts.</span><br>
<br>
<span>Fox</span><span> has
continued to feature the commentary of retired Gen. Robert H. Scales (</span><span>Special Report With Brit Hume</span><span>, 4/21/08, 4/23/08), whom the </span><span>New York Times</span><span> documented
to be a participant in the Pentagon program, without noting either his
affiliation with the Pentagon or the fact that he is a consultant for several
military contractors. </span><span>Fox</span><span> has also continued to air commentary from retired
Gen. Thomas <span>McInerney</span> (</span><span>4/28/08</span><span>), whom the </span><span>Times</span><span> had quoted responding after the Pentagon sent him
fresh talking points in late 2006: "Good work.... We will use it." </span><span>Fox</span><span> did not
disclose <span>McInerney's</span> participation in the Pentagon
program, nor the fact that he sits on the boards of several military
contractors, including Nortel Government Solutions. </span><br>

<br>
<span>While there have been segments on </span><span>CNN</span><span> (</span><span>Newsroom</span><span> 4/20/08, </span><span>Situation Room</span><span> With
Wolf Blitzer, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/21/sitroom.02.html" title="" target="_blank">4/21/08</a>, </span><span>Reliable
Sources</span><span>, <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/27/rs.01.html" title="" target="_blank">4/27/08</a>), </span><span>PBS</span><span> (</span><span><span>NewsHour</span></span><span>,
4/24/08) and </span><span>NPR</span><span> (</span><span>Bryant Park
Project</span><span>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89904780" title="" target="_blank">4/24/08</a>; </span><span>On the
Media</span><span>, <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2008/04/25/01" title="" target="_blank">4/25/08</a>; </span><span>All Things Considered</span><span>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90111757" title="" target="_blank">5/1/08</a>), the commercial broadcast networks that
aired the Pentagon-affiliated pundits’ commentary on the war seem to have
entirely ignored the story. </span><br>

<br>
<span>When comments on </span><span>NBC</span><span>'s blackout on
the Pentagon pundits scandal (</span><span>Salon</span><span>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/04/30/williams/" title="" target="_blank">4/30/08</a>) prompted </span><span>NBC
Nightly News</span><span> anchor Brian Williams to
respond on his <span>blog</span> (</span><span>Daily
Nightly</span><span>, <a href="http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/29/958477.aspx" title="" target="_blank">4/29/08</a>), he defended his news
organization’s reliance on these pundits. Williams stated that he had
“quickly entered into a close friendship with both" Gen. Wayne
Downing and Gen. Barry McCaffrey, and “these two guys never gave what I
considered to be the party line.” Declaring that "retired officers
of that rank ... are passionate patriots," he added that “in my
dealings with them, they were also honest brokers.”</span><br>

<br>
<span>Yet as the </span><span>Nation</span><span> magazine had documented three years prior (<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030421/interns" title="" target="_blank">4/21/03</a>),
both McCaffrey and Downing were founding members of the Committee for the
Liberation of Iraq, an organization founded to "engage in educational
advocacy efforts to mobilize U.S. and international support for policies aimed
at ending the aggression of Saddam Hussein," including through targeting
the U.S. media. </span><br>
<br>
<span>Moreover, as the </span><span>Nation</span><span> documented,
both retired generals had direct financial stakes in the war. McCaffrey, the
magazine reported, was "on the board of <span>Mitretek</span>,
<span>Veritas</span> Capital and two <span>Veritas</span>

companies, Raytheon Aerospace and Integrated Defense Technologies--all of which
have multimillion-dollar government defense contracts. Despite that, IDT is
floundering -- its stock price has fallen by half since March 2002 -- a
situation that one stock analyst says war could remedy. Since IDT is a
specialist in tank upgrades, the company stands to benefit significantly from a
massive ground war." McCaffrey was quoted in the </span><span>Nation</span><span> telling </span><span>MSNBC</span><span> viewers early
in the war, "Thank God for the Abrams tank and... the Bradley fighting
vehicle." Both pieces of military hardware relied on parts sold by IDT.</span><br>
<br>
<span>Downing was a member of the "board of
directors at Metal Storm Ltd., a ballistics-technology company that has
contracts with </span><span>U.S.</span><span> and Australian defense departments." </span><br>
<br>
<span>Media outlets’ failure to disclose
their military analysts’ ties to the Pentagon and to military contractors
highlights the need for more stringent vetting practices to detect conflicts of
interest and more independent sources in war coverage. The public deserves an
explanation of what steps media organizations are taking to ensure this kind of
breach never happens again. But instead of getting an explanation, the public
is getting almost complete silence.</span><br>
