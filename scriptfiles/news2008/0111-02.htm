<p>NEW YORK - January 11 - The American Civil Liberties Union announced celebrity support for its Close Guantánamo campaign on today’s six-year anniversary of the arrival of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. The ACLU is calling on Americans to wear orange today as an expression of opposition to indefinite detention at the U.S.-run prison and torture. Orange is the color of the jumpsuits worn by the first Gitmo detainees in photographs released by the Department of Defense in 2002.
<p></p>
The ACLU, along with other human rights organizations, launched the Close Guantánamo campaign in December. This week, the ACLU is hosting more than 20 events across the country including demonstrations in Washington, DC, Boston, Philadelphia and Boise, ID; protests in San Francisco and Tampa; a discussion in Pittsburgh; a vigil in Raleigh, NC; and a rally in St. Louis.
<p></p>
Here is what ACLU’s celebrity supporters are saying about the Close Guantánamo campaign:
<p></p>
Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon said, “I’ll be wearing orange because I believe in human rights.”
<p></p>
Alex Gibney, director of the new Guantánamo documentary “Taxi to the Dark Side” said, “I wear orange to remind myself of the reckless, ignorant and arrogant individuals who violated fundamental American values by setting up Guantánamo: a cynical monument to what a world without law would be like." 
<p></p>
Actress Gloria Reuben from “ER” will “definitely wear” orange because “respecting human rights is the only way to preserve humanity.”
<p></p>
Musician and television personality Henry Rollins said, “I’ll be wearing orange because this prolonged torture is obscene, nakedly sadistic and patently un-American.”
<p></p>
Singer-songwriter Meshell Ndegeocello, who will wear orange onstage at her performance tonight at the Music Hall of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, NY, said “I am wearing orange to help bring back the dignity our country has lost as a result of Guantánamo. We must join together in solidarity to demand the immediate closure of this shameful prison. It has tarnished America’s image in the world and continues to be a symbol of torture and injustice.”
<p></p>
In just three weeks, over 1,300 Facebook users subscribed to the ACLU’s Close Guantánamo page and over 230 people joined the ACLU’s MySpace page, including campaigns of both parties’ presidential candidates.
<p></p>
ACLU National Security Project Director Jameel Jaffer said, “People are turning out in force to express their opposition to the symbol and reality of Guantánamo. For six years, the Bush administration has flouted the Constitution and run roughshod over the international human rights system that the U.S. itself helped build. On January 11, we will send a clear message to the world that the administration must abandon its torture policies and shut down Guantánamo once and for all.”
