June 4 - Just as the Democratic Party was securing its nominee during their South Dakota and Montana primaries last night, Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was giving a speech to more than 7,000 people at the AIPAC dinner in Washington with possibly just as much consequence on the future of America's foreign policy. 
<p></p>
In the midst of a conference that has been immersed in the question of how to deal with the conceived threat Iran presents, Olmert encouraged sanctions on Iran and nations that refine gasoline for Iran, and called for nations to make it clear that Iranian businesses are not welcome within their borders. He based this on the grounds that Iran is the world's "largest exporter of terrorism" and that the country's "defiance of international resolutions and its continued tactics of deception and denial leave no doubt as to the urgent need for more drastic and robust measures."
<p></p>
This the same day Israeli newspaper Ha'arertz reported that Olmert will "try to convince Bush to set aside the national intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program in favor of data presented by Israel, and determine the administration's policy on Iran accordingly." 
<p></p>
With <a href="http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=33&Itemid=74&jumival=144" target="_new">John McCain</a> and Condoleezza Rice in the sidelines taking equally hostile positions on Iran at the conference, Olmert has managed to take the stage in an effort to convince Bush something must be done with Iran immediately despite the <a href="http://therealnews.com/t/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=1580" target="_new">accusations of corruption</a>, and even threat of losing his job, he faces at home.
