WASHINGTON - August 19 - ­ Last night, more than a dozen members of the state assembly
took a dive for the chemical industry and missed two critical votes on
measures to remove toxic chemicals from food packaging and some infant
products. As a result of those missed votes both bills went down in defeat,
handing a last-minute victory to an army of well-heeled chemical company
lobbyists.
<p></p>
The measures would have banned two notoriously toxic chemicals PFOA, a key
ingredient of Teflon, and BPA, from food containers and packaging, including
infant sippie cups and baby bottles.
<p></p>
"We will do our best to make sure that every parent in California, including
tens of thousands of our supporters, knows that a small group of California
assembly members took a dive yesterday for the chemical industry," said Ken
Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), which sponsored
both bills.
<p></p>
"These assembly members skipped votes that would have protected infants and
children from toxic industrial chemicals that are so pervasive they
contaminate babies in the womb," Cook observed.
<p></p>
"Wal-Mart and Burger King do a better job protecting Californians from these
chemicals that the California legislature," noted Cook, referring to the
companies respective decisions to eliminate BPA from baby bottles and PFOA
from food wraps.
<p></p>
Senate bill 1713 by Sen. Carol Migden of San Francisco, would ban bisphenol
A from baby bottles and other products. Laboratory studies show the chemical
harms brain development. Migden's measure failed on a 27-31 vote when 22
legislators abstained from voting.
<p></p>
Senate Bill 1313, by Sen. Ellen Corbett of San Leandro, would have banned
the chemical PFOA from food packaging, which has been identified as a likely
human carcinogen.  It fell five votes short of the 41 needed with 11 members
of the Assembly not voting.
