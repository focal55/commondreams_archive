TORONTO - May 13 - INTERVIEW - John McCain recently recruited several members of "The Committee on the Present Danger" as foreign policy advisers, including former CIA head James Woolsey. In the third installment of a three part interview, Paul Jay, Senior Editor of The REAL News Network conducts a video interview with Eric Margolis, contributing editor for The American Conservative and Sun Media and Founding Committee member of The Real News Network on how John McCain's vision for America and the world is influenced by Woolsey and his group of foreign policy advisors.

 <P></P>

Margolis informs that former CIA head James Woolsey is "… one of the point men for the extreme right wing of the Republican Party… [The Committee on Present Danger]… want[s] a very militaristic foreign policy….They want to use American power to destroy all of Israel's perceived enemies."  The interview includes Paul Jay and Eric Margolis examining a video of Woosley speaking during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. They pose and explore the revealing question of: "What does [this] tell us about John McCain and his and Woolsey's vision for the world?"
