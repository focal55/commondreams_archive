<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 15 -       The U.S. Senate passed a resolution authored 
          by U.S. Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI), Chairman of the Senate Foreign 
          Relations Subcommittee on African Affairs, calling on governments, multinational 
          bodies, and non-state actors in Chad, the Central African Republic (CAR), 
          and Sudan to implement a comprehensive peace process to end the violence. 
          The bipartisan resolution recognizes that the conflicts in Chad, CAR, 
          and Sudan are intricately related and require increased cooperation 
          and commitment from the national governments, backed by the wider international 
          community. Despite agreements to cease support to rebel groups, these 
          countries continue to suffer cross-border attacks by armed militants, 
          which have already displaced thousands and left millions of people in 
          need of humanitarian assistance. Feingold’s resolution is co-sponsored 
          by Senators Richard Lugar (R-IN), Carl Levin (D-MI), and Chuck Hagel 
          (R-NE) and 19 other senators.</p>
        <p>“The conflicts in Chad, the Central African Republic, and Sudan 
          cannot be resolved in a vacuum because they have both domestic and regional 
          implications. A sustainable peace requires good-faith negotiations both 
          within and between the countries with strong monitoring by the international 
          community,” Feingold said. “I am pleased the Senate has 
          sent such an important and timely message. The international community 
          cannot ignore the complex cross-border problems that have resulted in 
          great suffering."</p>

        <p>Feingold’s Resolution:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expresses concern for the citizens who have been gravely affected 
            by the violence in this region </li>
          <li>Calls upon all parties to cease hostilities immediately and uphold 
            human rights </li>
          <li>Urges the governments of Chad and Sudan to abide by promises not 
            to support insurgent groups and to recommit to inclusive negotiations 
            towards regional peace </li>
          <li>Urges the government of Chad to restore its political legitimacy 
            by improving accountability, provision of basic services, and respect 
            for basic human and political rights </li>

          <li>Encourages the United States and international community to support 
            multilateral peacekeeping missions in Darfur, Chad, and Central African 
            Republic and to play an active, constructive role in a comprehensive 
            peace process to stabilize the region </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feingold has served on the Subcommittee on African Affairs since 1993 
          and has served as both its Chairman and Ranking Member. As the current 
          Chairman, Feingold has continued to make sure the United States addresses 
          the region’s conflicts, humanitarian and health crises, and governance 
          challenges. </p>
