WASHINGTON, DC - May 13 -On the heels of an April 20 <em>New York Times</em> investigative <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2008%2F04%2F20%2Fwashington%2F20generals.html%3F_r%3D2%26st%3Dcse%26sq%3Dbarstow%26scp%3D2%26oref%3Dslogin%26oref%3Dslogin" title="blocked::http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/washington/20generals.html?_r=2&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=barstow&amp;scp=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/washington/20generals.html?_r=2&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=barstow&amp;scp=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">report</a> exposing the hidden
relationship between media military analysts and the Pentagon and defense
industries, <em>Media Matters for America</em>

today exclusively released an accounting of the analysts identified in the
Times exposé and their more than 4,500 appearances and quotations on ABC, ABC
News Now, CBS, CBS Radio Network, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, CNN Headline News, Fox
News, and NPR. The release documents just how far and wide the Pentagon program
reached.</p>

<p>In the three weeks since
the story by <em>Times </em>investigative
reporter David Barstow first appeared on the front page of that paper's
Sunday edition, members of the media have remained largely silent on the
subject while members of Congress have taken prompt action by calling for
congressional hearings and investigations by the Department of Defense, the
Government Accountability Office, and the Federal Communications
Commission.</p>

<p>"<strong>In the face of such damning evidence, the silence of those in the media who hosted or quoted
these military analysts more than 4,500 times reeks of irresponsible journalism</strong>,"
said Karl Frisch, a spokesman for <em>Media Matters</em>. "<strong>Because the media have failed to follow up on this
story with the tough questions one would expect, members of Congress have been
forced to act. It's time for the media to step up and do their
job."</strong></p>

<p><strong>"Had
this been a front-page story in the Sunday New York Times about a political sex
scandal, you can bet that we'd have seen wall-to-wall coverage on the TV
and radio,"</strong> Frisch continued. <strong>"These news outlets have set aside their
journalistic integrity to provide cover for themselves and once again
undermined their own credibility in the process. Their lack of a meaningful
response is an embarrassment."</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Media Matters</em> analysis released today
found that since January 1, 2002, the analysts named in Barstow's article --
many identified as having ties to the defense industry -- collectively appeared
or were quoted as experts more than 4,500 times on ABC, ABC News Now, CBS, CBS
Radio Network, NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, CNN Headline News, Fox News, and NPR in
segments covering the Iraq war both before and after the invasion, as well as
numerous other national security or government policy issues.</p>

on the hidden ties between media military analysts and the Pentagon. As of
11:59 p.m. ET May 7, ABC, CBS, Fox News, and NBC still had not reported on the
revelations in the <em><em>Times </em></em>story
on any of their news programs whose transcripts appear in the Nexis database.
ABC, CBS, and NBC, along with the three major cable news networks -- CNN, Fox
News, and MSNBC -- reportedly declined to participate in a segment on the April

military analysts on TV and in the Pentagon." Similarly, during a report
on this issue that aired during the May 1 broadcast of <em>All Things Considered,</em> NPR media
correspondent David Folkenflik stated that "[n]ews executives and
consultants wouldn't comment for this story, but privately say their on-air
comments were honestly held beliefs."</p>

<p>Fox News and CNN have
continued to host analysts named in the <em>Times
</em>article, even after the article's publication. David L. Grange

"Marty Ryan, a Fox News
executive producer, said yesterday that the analysts are hired not just for
their expertise but also as people 'who have access to and know what the
thinking of the Pentagon is. That makes them valuable to us.' " The
article continued: "With so many military commentators retained in
wartime, 'it's a little unrealistic to think you're going to do a big
background check on everybody,' Ryan
said. 'Some of the business ties aren't necessarily relevant when you're
asking them about a specific helicopter operation.' "</p>

<p><strong><u>Congress
Takes Action</u>: </strong>Congress has moved swiftly to examine the
hidden ties between media military analysts and the Pentagon. On April 22, Sen.
Carl Levin (D-MI), chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, wrote a <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Flevin.senate.gov%2Fnewsroom%2Frelease.cfm%3Fid%3D296687" title="blocked::http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=296687
http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=296687">letter</a>
to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates calling for an investigation into the
Department of Defense's program. Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Hillary
Clinton (D-NY) also called upon Gates to disclose the "extent" of
what the <em>Times </em>article suggested
was "an extensive, coordinated effort by the DOD and the Administration
... to try to influence the commentary of independent television military
analysts," as well as a full report from the Inspector General, in an
April 28 <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Flautenberg.senate.gov%2Fnewsroom%2Frecord.cfm%3Fid%3D296863" title="blocked::http://lautenberg.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=296863

That same day, Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) sent a <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fkerry.senate.gov%2Fcfm%2Frecord.cfm%3Fid%3D296846" title="blocked::http://kerry.senate.gov/cfm/record.cfm?id=296846
http://kerry.senate.gov/cfm/record.cfm?id=296846">letter</a>
to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) requesting an investigation into, among other things, the
"extent of the contact between Pentagon officials and the military
analysts in question regarding what was said by the analysts over the public
airwaves." Additionally, Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI) <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Ffeingold.senate.gov%2Fpdf%2Fltr_gao_050108.pdf" title="blocked::http://feingold.senate.gov/pdf/ltr_gao_050108.pdf

upon the GAO to determine whether the program "violated appropriations
prohibitions on publicity or propaganda activities" in a May 1 letter to
acting Comptroller General Gene Dodaro.</p>

<p>In the U.S. House of
Representatives, several members have led the charge calling for a
comprehensive review of the ethical ramifications of the military analyst
issue. On April 24, Rep. Paul Hodes (D-NH) requested in a <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fhodes.house.gov%2FPRArticle.aspx%3FNewsID%3D1522" title="blocked::http://hodes.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1522

to Rep. John Tierney (D-MA) that he, as Chairman of the Oversight and
Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, hold
hearings to address the issue. That same day, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) sent <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.house.gov%2Fdelauro%2Fpress%2F2008%2FApril%2FMajor_News_Networks_4_24_08.html" title="blocked::http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2008/April/Major_News_Networks_4_24_08.html

executives at ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and Fox News asking them to disclose their
"policies surrounding the hiring and vetting of military analysts
reporting on the Iraq War," and Rep.
Ike Skelton (D-MO) made a <a href="http://www.mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speaker.gov%2Fblog%2F%3Fp%3D1308" title="blocked::http://www.speaker.gov/blog/?p=1308

on the House floor, emphasizing the risk of losing the public "trust in
the Pentagon, in our retired officer corps, and in the press, each of which has
a critical role to play in preserving our nation's freedoms." The
following week, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) issued a "Dear Colleague"
