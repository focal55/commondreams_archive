BURMA - May 16 - The suffering inflicted by Cyclone Nargis almost two weeks ago is set to be compounded by the onset of Myanmar's "hungry season."
<P></P>
"Hungry season" is the period between May, when families have eaten much of their rice stocks from the previous harvest, through to October or November when the next yield is due.
<P></P>
The ability of poor farmers in the Irrawaddy Delta to plant for the upcoming wet season rice production has been badly affected by the cyclone.
<P></P>
Recent estimates suggest that 130,000 farming households in the Irrawaddy Division and 117,000 in Yangon Division have been affected by the cyclone. Total crop damage is estimated around 718,000 metric tons which includes 585,000 tons under storage.
<P></P>
"The agricultural cycle here is critical. There is very little time for us to help farmers prepare and plant their crops to avoid a hunger gap," said CARE's Country Director in Myanmar, Brian Agland.
<P></P>
The upcoming wet season rice production will be seriously and significantly affected due to the urgent need for seeds, fertilizers, farm animals and now the inadequate labor force due to heavy casualties.
<P></P>
CARE staff have delivered emergency relief in the form of food, water and non-food items to more than 80,000 people in Myanmar to date but heavy rains have made access even more difficult.
<P></P>
"In Yangon, our assessment team reached all the way down to the coast, going mainly by motorbikes. Roads are deteriorating because of the rain, so we are hiring small boats to reach these areas," said Brian Agland. "We have to go up estuaries and we have to look at how we get food to these areas."
<P></P>
The impact from the cyclone in these communities has been devastating. "We're finding villages where 200 people used to live, and now there's only five or ten."
<P></P>More funds will be needed to help with Myanmar's long-term recovery and CARE is appealing for $10 million to help implement its three-year recovery plan.<!-- #EndEditable -->
