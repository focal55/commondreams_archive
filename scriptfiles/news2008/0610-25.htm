 WASHINGTON, DC - June 10 - The Politico reports: "Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) introduced 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush on Monday night, reading the resolution into the Congressional Record. ... Kucinich has introduced a similar impeachment resolution against Vice President Cheney. That resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, which has taken no action on the measure. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other top House Democratic leaders have stated that there will be no consideration of impeachment proceedings against Bush, calling the idea 'off the table.'"<br>

<b><a href="mailto:skent@kentcom.com" target="_new">ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN</a></b><br>
Former Congresswoman Holtzman served on the House Judiciary Committee during Nixon's impeachment hearings and co-authored the 1973 special prosecutor statute. She co-wrote (with Cynthia L. Cooper) the book <i>The Impeachment of George W. Bush: A Practical Guide for Concerned Citizens</i>. Reacting to Rep. Kucinich's introducing articles of impeachment, she said: "Finally! The House should commence an impeachment inquiry forthwith; it is long overdue. Kudos to Congressman Kucinich for taking this step. The recent Senate Intelligence Report goes a long way to providing a framework for impeachment on the grounds of taking us to war on false pretenses, though it did not seek to determine what the President actually knew and when he knew it. It is incumbent on Congress to pursue that question now, not only regarding deception about the war, but other apparent grounds for impeachment as well."<br>
<br>
Earlier this year, Holtzman wrote the piece "<a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/currents/20080127_Judiciary_Committee_should_move_to_impeach_Bush_and_Cheney.html" target="_new">Judiciary Committee should move to impeach Bush and Cheney</a>" for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>.<br>

Elizabeth de la Vega is a former federal prosecutor and author of the book <i>U.S. v. George W. Bush et al.</i> She said today: "More than two centuries ago, the Founders of this country set forth a procedure for Congress to follow in the event of grave abuses of power by the Chief Executive. That process is impeachment. In the face of the monumental deceit and criminal abuse of power in virtually every executive function ... that we have witnessed on the part of the President over the past seven years, Rep. Kucinich's initiation of this process is neither fanciful nor futile, neither vengeful nor vindictive; it is the sober fulfillment of his sworn duty to uphold the law without regard to personal consequence and misguided political stratagem."<br>
