<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 16 - The Interfaith Alliance criticized presidential candidate Mike Huckabee (R-AR) for a statement he made yesterday about a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Governor Huckabee, speaking to a crowd in South Carolina, said: “I believe it's a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living God, and that's what we need to do is to amend the Constitution so it's in God's standards rather than try to change God's standards.” The Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, President of The Interfaith Alliance issued the following statement:
<p></p>
"Governor Huckabee needs to understand that the United States is a democracy, not a theocracy. The United States operates on the rule of law as determined by the will of the people, not a narrow interpretation of Christian Scripture. The campaign season is designed to elect the next commander-in-chief, not a pastor in chief. In a country that values the separation of religion from the institutions of government, it is dangerous for a politician to be so eager to impose his religious values on a religiously diverse people.
<p></p>
"Governor Huckabee has continuously abused religion as a partisan tool in his quest for the presidency. Just a few weeks ago, he attributed his rise in the polls to divine intervention by invoking the New Testament story about Jesus feeding a crowd of 5,000 with five loaves and two fish. And the last three Sundays, Governor Huckabee has preached sermons at churches strategically located on the campaign trail. As a consequence of using religion as a political strategy, both the sanctity of religion and the integrity of government become undermined."
<p></p>
The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a nonpartisan, grassroots organization dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, divisive agenda. With more than 185,000 members drawn from more than 75 faith traditions and 47 local activist groups throughout America, TIA promotes compassion, civility and mutual respect for human dignity in our increasingly diverse society.
