<p>WASHINGTON DC - February 20  - The February 18, 2008 announcement that more than 140 million pounds of frozen ground beef produced by a plant in California was being recalled has sparked lots of media coverage, not only because of the sheer size of the recall (the largest in U.S. history) but because of the dramatic video footage of the humane handling violations at the plant that sparked the recall.&nbsp; To top it off, the company that produced the recalled meat, Hallmark/Westland, is the second largest supplier of ground beef to the National School Lunch Program.&nbsp; So it’s no surprise that this has become a pretty big story, just the latest in a string of examples of our broken food safety system.<br>&nbsp;<br>But, as always, there is more to the story that what you see on the news.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What are downer cows exactly?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The recall was instituted because the plant violated a rule that downer cattle (those that cannot walk into the slaughter plant under their own power) are not allowed into the human food supply.&nbsp; This is because these animals could be suffering from neurological problems and are considered to be high risk for mad cow disease.&nbsp; When plants try to use downers, workers end up pushing, dragging, or otherwise forcing them into the plant.&nbsp; That is what the video footage obtained by the Humane Society of the United States shows.&nbsp; In addition to being cruel and inhumane, it is illegal, and that is why the USDA shut down the plant earlier this month after the video was released.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How did the plant get away with this?</h4>
<p>We think this is one of the most important questions.&nbsp; USDA has a longstanding problem with vacancies in the ranks of its meat inspectors, so there are questions about whether there were enough USDA inspectors in this plant to do all of the things they need to, including looking at live animals before they go to slaughter.&nbsp; Additionally, some inspectors have raised concerns that USDA management in the plant instructed them not to go outside to check animals.&nbsp; <a href="resolveuid/4fae96f736a3e426af588564f6097982" title="USDA Letter Regarding Downer Cows" target="_new" class="internal-link">Click here to read more about these concerns.</a><br>
  &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why was the recall so big?&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The amount of meat covered by this recall is so large because the USDA included all products that came from the plant for a long period of time – two years.&nbsp; This means that USDA is concerned that these violations may have been happening for that long, a sad commentary on their willingness to enforce their own rules.&nbsp; Because the recalled product is from such a long time period, most of it has probably been eaten, which makes the recall too little, too late.&nbsp; The other issue with this recall is that not all of the meat went to schools – some went to retail stores.&nbsp; For years, we have been urging USDA to include the names of stores where recalled product was sold in their public announcements.&nbsp; This massive recall just shows once again that this information is vital for consumers and the agency is irresponsible not to release it.<br><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How do I find out if I bought meat involved in this recall?&nbsp; <br></h4>
<p>The ground beef from Hallmark/Westland will have a stamp on it that says "Est. 336" on the package.&nbsp; This is the indentification number for this plant.&nbsp; <span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fsis_Recalls/index.asp" target="_new" class="external-link">Click here for a list of types of product types that were recalled.</a></span><br>
