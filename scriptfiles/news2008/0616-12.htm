June 16 - While US presidential candidate John McCain places the importance of  US troops in Iraq, two senior Iraqi MPs call for withdrawal.
<p></p>
John McCain claims "If our troops are ordered to make a forced retreat, we risk all-out civil war, genocide, and a failed state in the heart of the Middle East." He also believes that withdrawal of US troops would cause intervention from Iran.
<p></p>
Nadim Al-Jaberi, MP of the Iraqi Fadhila party disagrees and says "Iran's influence grew due to the presence of the American forces on the Iraqi land". He also points out that the "the political elite that are loyal to Iran are the same people who are supported by the United States."
<p></p>
Iraqi MP Khalaf Al-Ilyan says that despite the majority of Iraqis who believe that US troops should completely withdraw within a year, the government cannot request this because "it's primarily controlled by minority parties that are not liked in Iraq," and that these parties "prefer that the US troops remain, because they will be weakened if the occupation ends."
<p></p>
According to Al-Ilyan, Iraq would be able to protect its borders if given the opportunity to rebuild its army. US occupation and control of the army, however, makes it impossible. He also adds that Iraq can only regain balance and rebuild its own security forces if US withdraws gradually.
