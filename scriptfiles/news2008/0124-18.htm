<p>BOISE, IDAHO - January 24 - The 
U.S. Fish &amp; 
Wildlife Service released an updated rule Thursday governing the management of 
gray wolves in the northern Rockies. The rule 
dramatically broadens the circumstances under which these wolves may be killed, 
significantly reducing protections for this endangered species. The rule is 
separate from a current proposal to delist wolves from the Endangered Species 
Act, and instead governs how wolves will be managed while they remain on the 
federal list of threatened and endangered species.</p>
<p>The following is a statement from Suzanne Stone, northern 
Rockies wolf conservation specialist for Defenders of 
Wildlife regarding Thursday’s announcement.</p>
<p>“This is a giant step backward. Under the rule finalized 
today, more than 750 wolves – over half of the region’s wolf population – could 
be killed, even though this wolf population is still protected by the Endangered 
Species Act.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“Stripping away protection for our wolves is entirely 
unjustified. Elk and deer populations in all three northern 
Rockies states are at or near record highs, and 
nonlethal, proactive methods are helping to reduce conflicts between wolves and 
livestock. There is absolutely no reason to begin a wholesale slaughter of the 
region’s wolves. Yet that is exactly what the federal government is willing to 
allow the states to do: wipe out hundreds of the wolves our nation has worked so 
hard to recover. </p>
<p>“This is a scheme based on backdoor politics, not science, 
and it goes too far. Wolves in the northern Rockies have 
only recently neared a point where the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service could 
consider removing federal protections from them. In finalizing this rule, the 
Service is ignoring its responsibility to ensure the long-term survival of the 
region’s wolf population.</p>

<p>“We need to work together to reach recovery. We can only do 
that by creating balanced wolf management plans that ensure a stable population 
of wolves in the future. Unfortunately, the threat to wolves posed by this new 
rule leaves us no choice but to involve the courts and file a legal challenge to 
put a stop to this plan.”</p>
