<p> April 21 - In light of the <b>New York Times' </b>expose of the Pentagon's program of using cable and broadcast news network military analysts to promote government talking points, FAIR media analyst Peter Hart is available for interviews about the media's role as a conduit for Pentagon propaganda.
<p></p>
-The Pentagon's strategies were made possible because media outlets actively recruited individuals with close ties to the Pentagon and the defense industries--going so far, in the case of <b>CNN</b>, as to ensure that their newly hired generals had a "thumbs up" from the Pentagon (as <b>CNN</b>'s Eason Jordan
put it).
<p></p>
-FAIR's studies reveal that the media relied disproportionately on establishment sources such as these retired generals in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq and during the war, contributing to an overwhelming pro-war
slant.
<p></p>
-The TV networks and cable outlets' practice of hiring analysts who had a financial stake in the war is particularly disturbing in light of the fact that these financial conflicts of interest had previously been documented in <b>The Nation</b> magazine in April 2003.
<p></p>
-FAIR is calling on the TV and cable networks to take action to ensure that the news will no longer serve as a conduit for Pentagon talking points passed off as independent analysis. FAIR is also calling for the media to
expand their range of independent sources.
<p></p>
Peter Hart, FAIR's Activism Director, has been interviewed by a number of media outlets, including <b>NBC Nightly News</b>, <b>Fox News Channel</b>'s <b>O'Reilly Factor</b>, the <b>Los Angeles Times</b>, <b>Newsday</b> and the <b>Associated Press</b>. He is the author of "The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly" (Seven Stories Press, 2003).
