<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 30 - Over a year ago, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) included Lurita Doan in its report, Criminals and Scoundrels: The 25 Most Corrupt Officials of the Bush Administration. Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW released the following statement on Doan’s reported firing Tuesday:
<p></p>
“Lurita Doan should have been fired from her position over a year ago. The fact that she was kept in a powerful office after blatantly violating the Hatch Act is just another example of this administration’s stunning tolerance of those who break the law. Hopefully, she is the first of many that will be held accountable for their conduct. But, having watched the Bush administration over the past seven years, we know better than to hold our breath.”
