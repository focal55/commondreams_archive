<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - May 5 - The Bush administration today released its revised salmon management plan for the Columbia and Snake rivers. This latest salmon plan calls for less protective operation of federal dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers than have been ordered in recent years by a federal court. 
<p>The plan also gives only superficial treatment to the impact global warming will have on endangered salmon runs both in rivers and in the ocean, and it fails to analyze the salmon survival gains that would come from removing the four high cost, low value dams on the lower Snake River.</p>
<p>Michael Garrity, Associate Director of Columbia Basin Programs for American Rivers, made the following statement:</p>
“It is time for new leadership and new solutions. At a time when the west coast’s salmon fishery is being declared a failure, and our rivers and salmon are increasingly stressed by the impacts of global warming, we need creative and bold ideas that will move us beyond the unacceptable status quo embodied by the Bush administration’s salmon plan.”
<p>“For years, removing the four lower Snake dams has been framed as a painful measure, but it is time for Northwest leaders to acknowledge the facts. These dams provide very limited benefits in a basin with over 200 dams. We can remove the four lower Snake dams, restore a healthy river, bring back salmon and steelhead, protect farmers, invest in clean energy, and ensure a strong economic future. Dam removal is a necessary part of an effective salmon recovery package and can be done in a way that works for local communities.”</p>
<p>“The people of the Northwest want to be able to fish for abundant salmon and steelhead. They want healthy rivers, strong family farms and clean energy. The Bush administration’s plan clearly won’t get us there, but we can achieve these things if we have the right leadership, if we work together, and if we make the right investments.”<br>
