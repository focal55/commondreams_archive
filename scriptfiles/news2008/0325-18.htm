<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 25 - Throughout March, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has celebrated Women’s History Month by profiling inspirational lesbian, bisexual and transgender women who are working toward full equality. While the commemorative month is winding down, the Task Force’s commitment to honoring such women continues in the form of a new, ongoing online roll call spotlighting these many leaders and their contributions to the social justice movement. The Task Force is encouraging the public to submit names by e-mailing <a href="mailto:outspoken@thetaskforce.org">OutSpoken@theTaskForce.org</a>.</p>
                                <p>“When we began this project, we wanted to mark Women’s History Month by lifting up our lesbian, bisexual and transgender women leaders. Women's leadership is everywhere within our movement — on the frontlines, at the podium, at the helm of public actions and behind the scenes. We thought ‘let’s raise up this reality as well as honor the women who are making a difference,’” explains Task Force Communications Director Roberta Sklar. “We began with a limited set of names and categories but soon found the list to be unending — so now we’ve swung the doors wide open for all to participate. We’re asking the community to help name the names of inspirational lesbian, bisexual and transgender women who are leading the way to full equality.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>During Women’s History Month, the Task Force posted profiles of more than 30 lesbian, bisexual and transgender leaders on its Web site and compiled a list of more than 60 others&nbsp;in an online project titled <em>Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Women Lead the Way</em>. <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/activist_center/womens_hist_month_08" target="_new">Read the diverse profiles here</a>. These leaders stand among many more who share an energy, passion and vision of a fair and just society. </p>
                                <p align="center"><strong>Want to submit a name to the roll call? Here’s how:</strong></p>
                                <p>Include the woman’s name, organizational affiliation, a sentence describing her leadership (feel free to include a link to a bio), the organization’s Web site or an article that might describe your selection’s work. </p>
                                <p align="center"><strong>Then e-mail your submission to </strong><a href="mailto:outspoken@thetaskforce.org">OutSpoken@theTaskForce.org</a>.</p>


<p><font size="1"><i><em>The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge.</em><!-- #EndEditable -->
