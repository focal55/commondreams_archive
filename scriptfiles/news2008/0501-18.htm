<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 1 - Are you a campus leader who wants to take your organization to the next level? Are you looking to play a vital role in a growing environmental and social justice movement? Want to help stop water from becoming the oil of the 21st century?<br><br>Food &amp; Water Watch is a national advocacy organization, working to ensure access to safe, clean, and affordable water for everyone. Working with allies from Maine to California, from Tanzania to Bolivia, we challenge corporate abuses of our most essential resources through grassroots organizing, media, and legislative campaigning.<br><br>This summer, we are placing qualified organizing fellows in cities around the country to coordinate our Take Back the Tap campaign. We’re looking for dedicated, self-motivated individuals, with a passion for environmental and social justice. Political experience is not required; however, we do require- a desire to learn, a sense of humor, and a strong set of time management skills.<br><br>This rigorous Summer Fellowship Program includes a four-day training in Washington D.C. with national campaign staff and movement leaders. Gain hands-on experience in media and messaging; volunteer recruitment and management; organizational coalition-building; campaign strategy; and more. Weekly planning sessions and site visits with national organizers throughout your fellowship. College credit available!<br><br><strong>Time: </strong>20/hrs a week, June 6- August 15th.<br><strong>Stipend:&nbsp;</strong> $1000<br><strong>Deadline for applications: </strong>May 15th. <br><strong>Locations: </strong>Northampton, MA; Grand Rapids, MI, Ann Arbor, MI; Portland, OR; Portland, ME; New York City, NY; Gainesville, FL; Asheville, NC.<br>Preference will be given to people who are already in these locations. <br>To apply, send your resume and cover letter to : <span class="link-mailto"><a href="mailto:aweinberg@fwwatch.org" target="_new" class="external-link">aweinberg@fwwatch.org</a></span>; or fax to: 202-683-2501.
