WASHINGTON - July 8 -  With momentum building for fundamental change in the nation’s health care system, SEIU – the largest union of health care workers – today helped launch a new, national coalition that will bring together millions of Americans to demand quality, affordable health care for all.
<p></p>
“In America, war is a given, and health care is a maybe.  In America, fast food is affordable and health care is not.  That’s today’s America.  Tomorrow’s will be much, much different,” said SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger at the launch of ‘Health Care for America NOW.’ “That’s the power this unprecedented coalition signifies.”
<p></p>
Forming Health Care for America NOW – an unprecedented coalition that unites labor, community organizations, doctors, nurses, women, small businesses, faith-based organizations, people of color, netroots activists, and think tanks – is just the latest in a groundswell of activities pushing for comprehensive health care reform.
<p></p>
From the bargaining table to the ballot box, SEIU has been at the forefront of this movement -- forming groundbreaking alliances with the business community, building a grassroots army of health care voters, organizing the “Road to American Health Care” nationwide bus tour, and holding the politicians accountable to the millions of people demanding a solution to the health care crisis.
<p></p>
“Health Care for America NOW” was launched today with the Washington, DC press conference and events in 52 other cities across the country.  Along with SEIU, the coalition is being led by ACORN, AFSCME, Americans United for Change, Campaign for America's Future, Center for American Progress Action Fund, Center for Community Change, MoveOn.org, National Education Association, National Women's Law Center, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, United Food and Commercial Workers, and USAction.
<p></p>
<i>With 2 million members in Canada, the United States and Puerto Rico, SEIU is the fastest-growing union in the Americas. Focused on uniting workers in healthcare, public services and property services, SEIU members are winning better wages, healthcare, and more secure jobs for our communities, while uniting their strength with their counterparts around the world to help ensure that workers, not just corporations and CEOs, benefit from today's global economy.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
