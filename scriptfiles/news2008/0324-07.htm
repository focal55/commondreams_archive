<p>CALIFORNIA - March 24 - 
The Mojave Desert provides more than 1 billion 
dollars annually in economic benefits to the counties of Inyo, Kern, 
Riverside and San Bernardino, and the Lancaster-Palmdale area of 
Los 
Angeles 
County, according to Defenders of Wildlife’s new 
economic analysis Economic Oasis: 
Revealing the Value of the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>“The Mojave Desert is worth the most to 
California both economically and ecologically as an intact 
and vibrant landscape,” said Mike Skuja, California representative for Defenders of Wildlife. “We 
want Economic Oasis to illustrate to 
Californians in the areas around the Mojave exactly what this amazing desert has 
to offer as a protected sanctuary for some of the most unique animals and plants 
on the planet. As it turns out, it is worth more than even we were expecting!” 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report, based on an analysis by Defenders, has 
identified six ways that the Mojave contributes to the overall economy of the 
region: </p>

<ul class="bulleted"><li><strong>$230 
million</strong> in outdoor recreation 
spending in 2003, resulting in <strong>$338 
million</strong> in total regional sales; 

</li><li>An estimated <strong>$363 million</strong> pumped into the local 
economy by the Twentynine Palms Marine base, generating over <strong>$690 million</strong> in total regional sales, 
and almost <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> per year in 
total regional sales in the entire state from Edwards Air Force 
Base;
</li><li><strong>$100 
million</strong> in Antelope Valley alone 
from filming movies, commercials, music videos, television shows as well as 
shoots for print ads and still photography of the landscape, <strong>$3.3 million</strong> of which was pumped 
directly into the local economy from 2002 to 2003;
</li><li>More than <strong>$450 million</strong> in real estate value in 
Inyo and San 
Bernardino 
counties alone according to a 2004 study;

</li><li>More than <strong>$520 million</strong> from the sale of renewable 
energy generated from solar, geothermal and wind sources. The renewable energy 
industry also directly or indirectly employs over 1,100 area 
residents;
</li><li>Other irreplaceable benefits such as clean air 
(saving Inyo, Riverside and San Bernardino counties an estimated <strong>$20 million</strong> in healthcare costs per 
year), clean water (estimated to be worth between <strong>$90 and $110 million</strong> per year), 
research and education.</li></ul>
<p>Many locals, including Brian Brown, owner of 
Death 
Valley’s China Ranch Date 
Farm, recognize the relationship between a healthy Mojave and strong 
communities. Brown says, “People come to our region now specifically to see 
untrammeled desert, trackless expanses and, per chance, wildlife. We are a 
tourism economy, and a healthy wild desert is what we have to offer. Without 
that, we would literally dry up and blow away.”</p>
<p>“The Mojave brings so much to this region in terms 
of money for local communities, recreation, unique wildlife and protected open 
spaces,” said Skuja. “It is our sincere hope that civic leaders, policy-makers 
and citizens will take this new information and make a long-term commitment to 
protecting this valuable land for the benefit of current and future residents 
and visitors.”</p>
