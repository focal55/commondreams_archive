<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 30 - The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded a 
Senate subcommittee for holding a hearing on the Bush administration’s use of 
secrecy to institute government policy. During the hearing, entitled "Secret Law 
and the Threat to Democratic and Accountable Government," the Senate Judiciary 
Subcommittee on the Constitution and its chairman, Senator Russell Feingold 
(D-WI), heard testimony from legal experts and open government advocates. The 
hearing focused on the administration’s broad interpretation of the law as it 
relates to government secrecy and counterterrorism policies – including a legal 
opinion written by former Justice Department Official John Yoo on the use of 
torture in interrogations. That memo was made public through a Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) request made by the ACLU. </p>
<p>"Government transparency is the cornerstone of democracy," said Caroline 
Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "This 
administration has been rewriting the Constitution memo by memo. From what we’ve 
seen of the self-serving opinions issued by the Office of Legal Counsel, we can 
only believe that those that remain secret must equally distort the law in favor 
of President Bush’s agenda. An agenda built on secrecy and overclassification is 
antithetical to our country’s ideals." </p>

<p>The ACLU noted that the Bush administration’s track record on government 
secrecy has been dismal at best. Memos from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) 
outlining legal opinions on torture and wiretapping remain classified despite 
several congressional calls for disclosure. The administration has also 
frequently issued executive orders only to amend those policies without publicly 
acknowledging the changes, removed public documents from the National Archives 
and created an unusual system of retroactive secrecy by reclassifying previously 
public information. One of the most public debates on executive power and 
secrecy has been rooted in the executive’s ability to conduct surveillance. 
Since the revelation of the president’s warrantless wiretapping program by the 
New York Times in December of 2005, that debate has been held publicly in 
Congress. However a missing piece of that debate is a still-secret OLC memo. 
</p>
<p>Last year, the ACLU filed a request with the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court for orders and legal papers discussing the scope of the 
government's authority to engage in the secret wiretapping of Americans. In 
December, a FISC judge ruled that the court would not conduct an independent 
review to determine whether or not the orders and legal papers were properly 
determined to be classified.</p>
<p>In recent years, the ACLU has engaged in a broad effort to uncover 
information about the Bush administration's torture and surveillance policies. 
In October 2003, the ACLU filed a FOIA request for records concerning the 
treatment of prisoners in U.S. custody abroad. To date, more than 100,000 pages 
of government documents have been released in response to the ACLU's FOIA 
lawsuit enforcing the request – including the&nbsp;2003 Yoo memo which stated 
that&nbsp;the president could authorize the torture of prisoners.&nbsp; Many 
critical documents, however, remain secret.&nbsp; Among the documents that still 
have not been released are an OLC memo&nbsp;listing interrogation 
methods&nbsp;for use by the CIA, and a Presidential Directive authorizing the 
CIA to set up secret detention facilities overseas.</p>
<p>"This administration’s view of executive power is hostile not only to the 
Constitution but to our entire system of checks and balances," continued 
Fredrickson. "The president is bound by the same laws that govern every American 
citizen and to claim otherwise is outrageous. If nothing else, warping the role 
of the executive will be this administration’s legacy. We applaud Senator 
Feingold for holding this hearing."</p>
