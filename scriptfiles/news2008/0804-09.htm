BERKELEY, California - August 4 - The Peace Education Fund and the Campaign for a Nuclear Weapons Free World today began an ad campaign called "The Elephant in the Room," which calls on the presidential candidates to "turn words into action" on nuclear security. The ads are also intended for Senators Reid and Dorgan, whose leadership is considered crucial on arms control.
<p></p>
The ad compares nuclear weapons to a radioactive "elephant in the room." It declares, "Ignoring nuclear weapons won't make them go away. Tell our presidential candidates to lead us away from the biggest threat facing the U.S. and the world."
<p></p>
From Jon Rainwater, Executive Director of the Peace Education Fund:
<p></p>
"During the last eight years, the Bush administration has used nuclear weapons as an excuse for its bellicose foreign policy, but has had no real strategy for making the world safer from this threat. We are glad that Senators Obama and McCain have spoken in favor of eliminating the nuclear threat, but it's critical that they articulate a plan for concrete action."
<p></p>
From Martin Fleck, Coordinator for the Campaign for a Nuclear Weapons Free World:
<p></p>
"Americans are looking to the incoming President to lead the world in concrete steps toward a nuclear weapons free world: deep reductions in nuclear arsenals, preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons, and ending the development and testing of new weapons. As Senate Majority Leader and Democratic party leader, Senator Harry Reid can play an important role in furthering the debate on nuclear weapons policy in the Senate, the media, and the public."
<p></p>
"Sen. Byron Dorgan has spoken out strongly in favor of reviewing US nuclear weapons policy and the role nuclear weapons play in our security strategy. As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommitee, Senator Dorgan is a respected and influential voice in Congress on nuclear weapons issues."
