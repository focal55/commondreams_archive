WASHINGTON - July 10 - The Appignani Humanist Legal Center
(AHLC), legal arm of the American Humanist Association, expressed its
satisfaction today with a settlement resulting from its academic freedom
advocacy on behalf of humanist educator Steven C. Bitterman in his dispute
with Southwestern Community College in Red Oak, Iowa.
<p></p>
Bitterman had been an adjunct faculty member in the history department of
the college since 2001, teaching Western Civilization at least three times.
No complaints had been made against him by students or faculty until
September 2007. When some students, taking his class via closed-circuit
television, objected to Bitterman saying that the biblical story of Adam and
Eve shouldn’t be taken literally, they alleged that this and other
statements belittled their religion. He later responded in an interview in
“Community College Week,” published October 8, 2007, saying, “I put the
Hebrew religion on the same plane as any other religion. Their god wasn’t
given any more credibility than any other god.”
<p></p>
On September 20, 2007, Bitterman was fired. In an October 11 letter he
called upon the college to publicly commit to the principle of academic
freedom by acknowledging “that all ideas and beliefs are open to critical
assessment in the classroom by both instructors and students.” The attorney
for the college responded on October 19, declaring, in part:
<p></p>
“First and foremost, the College understands and adheres to the principles
of academic freedom in the governance of its instructors. All instructors at
Southwestern Community College, both full-time and adjunct, are given the
freedom to present the material for which they are responsible in the manner
of their choosing. Consistent with sound principles of academic instruction,
all instructors are expected to select methods of presentation which are
educationally effective and which respect the rights and interests of
students.”   
<p></p>
This was followed by negotiations that resulted in the settlement that has
now become final. By agreement of the parties, the terms of the settlement
have not been disclosed.
<p></p>
“I’m satisfied with this settlement and pleased that this dispute didn’t
have to go further or take longer,” Bitterman said. “As I’d indicated in the
beginning, handling matters in this way is preferable.”    
<p></p>
Bitterman’s attorney, Brad Schroeder of Des Moines, Iowa, who was recruited
and assisted by the AHLC, stated he was appreciative of the widespread
support his client has received from members of the academic
community. “That support certainly helped facilitate this resolution,” he
said. “We feel our concerns have been addressed.”
<p></p>
“Part of the mission of the American Humanist Association is to take action
upholding the civil liberties of humanists,” added AHA Executive Director
Roy Speckardt. “Today we are pleased that Southwestern Community College has
done the right thing.”
<p></p>
