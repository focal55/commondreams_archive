<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 24 - Council for a Livable World today called on Congress to use the Bush administration's pending supplemental war funding request to bring U.S. troops home.
<p></p>
Approving this massive amount of funds, without either a deadline for withdrawal or a stipulation that funds can only be spent for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, would be a mistake.
<p></p>
John Isaacs, Council for a Livable World's Executive Director, argued that the time for symbolic votes is long past.
<p></p>
"The disastrous war in Iraq has entered its sixth year. There is no end in sight with this President in office," said Isaacs.
<p></p>
"Simply calling for a change in policy or changing reconstruction grants to loans would be symbolic and unacceptable. Putting in a hard withdrawal deadline, or demanding that funding only be used for the withdrawal of troops, would have a real impact," continued Isaacs.
<p></p>
"Congress should also include a ban on the use of torture by any American government agency and a requirement that any long-term agreement with Iraq be approved by Congress," Isaacs added
<p></p>
The House and Senate are currently deciding how to consider the supplemental appropriations bill, which could come up in the House as early as next week. At stake is the administration's remaining fiscal year 2008 war funding request of $108 billion, as well as $70 billion in "bridge" funding for fiscal year 2009 that may be added. This "super supplemental" might therefore reach $170 billion.
<p></p>
Council for a Livable World has consistently urged congressional leaders to hold firm on important provisions while avoiding handing the Bush administration a blank check for Iraq.<!-- #EndEditable -->
