<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 18 - Fourteen members of the House of 
Representatives, including seven committee chairs, have filed a 
friend-of-the-court brief with the U.S. Supreme Court supporting Defenders of 
Wildlife and The Sierra Club’s arguments that the waiver authority granted to 
the Bush administration under the REAL ID Act is unconstitutional, and that this case 
should be heard by the Supreme Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>“The reality of the scope of power that the last 
Congress handed to the Bush administration under the 
REAL ID Act is starting to sink in with a lot of 
people, especially since the administration announced those unprecedented 
sweeping waivers on April 1,” said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders 
of Wildlife. “There was a huge ‘oops’ moment among some members of Congress. 
Offering their support for our constitutional challenge is one way that they can 
start reestablishing balance among the branches of government.” 
</p>
<p>Members of the House included on the 
friend-of-the-court brief are: Homeland 
Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), Energy &amp; Commerce 
Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), Transportation &amp; 
Infrastructure Committee Chairman James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), Education and 
Labor Committee Chairman George Miller (D-Calif.), Rules Committee Chairwoman 
Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), Veteran Affairs Chairman Bob Filner (D-Calif.), 
Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes (D-Texas), Congressman Solomon 
Ortiz (D-Texas), Congressman Sam Farr (D-Calif.), Congresswoman Sheila 
Jackson-Lee (D-Texas), Congresswoman Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.), Congresswoman 
Hilda Solis (D-Calif.), Congressman Raul M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), and 
Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.).</p>
<p>Two other amicus briefs were filed yesterday: One 
by a diverse coalition including the Tohono O’odham Nation, religious leaders, 
and historic preservation and conservation organizations, and a second by a 
group of 28 distinguished law professors and constitutional scholars. 

</p>

<p>“Groups that have been looking at this issue from 
many different perspectives are now coming together to focus on this 
unconstitutional waiver authority, which makes a travesty of basic 
constitutional principles,” added Schlickeisen. “People around the nation are 
joining together and acting to put a stop to the Bush administration’s 
relentless maneuvering to build a senseless wall.”</p><p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/programs_and_policy/habitat_conservation/federal_lands/border_policy/index.php" target="_new">Learn more about what Defenders is doing to protect wildlife along the border.</a></p>
