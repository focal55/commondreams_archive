June 2 - Three years after Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans community is still struggling to rebuild. Actor and humanitarian Danny Glover visited New Orleans to support the Algebra Project, which aims at helping low-income students and students of color to achieve mathematical skills.
<p></p>
Community developers have been actively trying to provide role models like Danny Glover for young people in the community, making parents an integral part of the school support system, and supporting students in their own initiatives to keep their community strong.
<p></p>
The rebuilding efforts have not been enough so far: "If we're the richest country in the world, why are we still in as bad shape as we are right now?" says one student of John McDonough school and member of the school's drama program which not only is aimed to bring young women of the community together, but addresses issues that they face such as pregnancy and abuse through the arts.
<p></p>
Glover comments, "And the question becomes where do we go from here?" With American workers working 250 hours a year, and filling income gaps by also using credit and equity in their homes, and decent jobs being outsourced, communities, especially communities of color, face the choice of "community or chaos", now more than ever. "As much courage as it has taken for every single person here who has come back to this city to help rebuild this city, we will have to go overstep and overleap that current to build the community that we need to build."
