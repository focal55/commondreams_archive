WASHINGTON, DC - May 23 - The American Civil Liberties Union applauds the introduction of a Senate bill reauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Championed by Senators Joe Biden (D-DE) and Sam Brownback (R-KS), this bill takes great strides towards preventing the abuse, exploitation and trafficking of domestic workers employed by foreign diplomats. 
<P></P>
Although the problem has been well documented, until recently policymakers ignored the State Department’s unwitting facilitation of the trafficking, exploitation and enslavement of poor women of color from around the world. It does so by issuing special nonimmigrant employment visas – over 3,000 every year – so that ambassadors, foreign diplomats, consular officers and employees of international organizations such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can bring their nannies and other household workers into the United States. Too often, these domestic workers become slaves in the household, unaware of their rights and unable to escape, while their tormentors are shielded by the domestic worker's anonymity and by diplomatic immunity.
<P></P>
“This is long overdue,” said Vania Leveille, ACLU Legislative Counsel, “and we thank Senators Biden and Brownback for their leadership. Many of these women came to this country from places like Zimbabwe, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Paraguay in order to provide for themselves and their families and were told, by the State Department, that they would be protected by the laws of the United States. Instead, they found themselves exploited and enslaved. The Senate bill makes clear that the trafficking and enslavement of domestic workers by diplomats within the U.S. will no longer be tolerated.”
<P></P>
The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 is an important first step in changing this intolerable situation. Acknowledging the particular vulnerability of these workers, the Senate bill contains specific provisions to enhance the protections for this vulnerable population and creates greater accountability within foreign missions and international organizations that receive the visas. It ensures that domestic workers are made aware of their rights in this country and are contacted by a State Department employee for a personal interview. It also requires a contract be executed between the employer and domestic worker containing key terms and conditions of employment, and mandatory recordkeeping on diplomats and domestic workers by the State Department, including allegations of trafficking or abuse.<!-- #EndEditable -->
