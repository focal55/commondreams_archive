<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA - February 15 -  A new policy brief from the
Minneapolis based <a href="http://www.ilsr.org" target="_new">Institute for Local Self-Reliance</a> (ILSR) criticizes
the authors of two recent studies published in Science for advancing a
conclusion not supported by their own studies.
<p></p>
“The studies usefully estimate how much carbon will be released when new
land is brought into crop production,” says David Morris, ILSR’s Vice
President and author of Ethanol and Land Use Changes. “But the authors’
declarations that ethanol increases greenhouse gas emissions, a
conclusion that has made headlines around the world, is not supported,
and may be contradicted, by their own data.”
<p></p>
The report notes that the vast majority of today’s ethanol production
comes from corn cultivated on land that has been in corn production for
generations. “Since little new land has come into production, either
directly or indirectly, the current use of ethanol clearly reduces
greenhouse gas emissions,” says Morris, who served six years on an
Advisory Committee on biomass to the U.S. Departments of Energy and
Agriculture.
<p></p>
The studies fail to recognize the very low greenhouse gas emissions from
advanced ethanol plants, plants that can reduce emissions by over 50
percent as compared to gasoline. Nor do the studies factor in the higher
greenhouse gases that will be emitted when crude oil is extracted from
unconventional sources like tar sands.
<p></p>
A controversial part of these studies examines the indirect impacts of
growing energy crops. For example, if corn acreage displaces soybeans in
the U.S., the authors assume that an equal amount of soybeans will have
to be grown in the rest of the world to make up for that loss in animal
feed. But a byproduct of corn ethanol production is a high protein
animal feed called distiller’s grains. Indeed, distiller’s grains
produce more protein per acre of corn harvested than is produced from an
acre of soybeans.
<p></p>
The most contentious part of the studies may be the conclusion that when
countries import less food and feed from the U.S., growing more
themselves, that greenhouse gases increase. “The conclusion is not only
counterintuitive, but will undoubtedly stir up considerable opposition
by farmers and advocates of local food around the world,” says Morris,
who also has served as an advisor to the energy administrations of
Presidents Ford, Carter, Clinton and George W. Bush.
