NATIONWIDE - July 23 - Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), a leader for health care reform on Capitol Hill, is the first Democratic National Convention delegate to sign a new statement urging that the convention adopt a plank in the 2008 party platform to "guarantee accessible health care for all."
<P></P>
Launched by Progressive Democrats of America on Wednesday (July 23), the statement aims to gather hundreds of signers among delegates to the party's national convention before it opens in Denver in late August.
<P></P>
The brief document, titled "Statement in support of Universal Health Care as a plank in the Democratic Party Platform of 2008," was drafted by two co-chairs of PDA's Healthcare NOT Warfare campaign, Congressman Conyers and writer Norman Solomon. Both are Obama delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
<P></P>
Also signing the statement prior to its national launch on July 23 was Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), a Clinton delegate and PDA board member.
<P></P>
A nationwide effort got underway Wednesday among activists nationwide to contact and encourage convention delegates to add their names as signers.
<P></P>
The statement calls for the 2008 Democratic Party Platform to include "a plank calling for our nation to enact universal health care that will":
<P></P><ul>
<li></li>"guarantee accessible health care for all";
<P></P>
<li></li>"create a single standard of high quality, comprehensive, and preventive health care for all";
<P></P>
<li></li>"allow freedom of choice of physician, hospital, and other health care providers";
<P></P>
<li></li>"eliminate financial barriers that prevent families and individuals from obtaining the medically necessary care they need";
<P></P>
<li></li>"allow physicians, nurses and other licenced health care providers to make health care decisions based on what is best for the health of the patient."
</ul><P></P>
PDA is encouraging activists -- wherever they live -- to contact delegates from their area and urge them to become signers. The statement is posted at:
