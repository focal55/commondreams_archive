WASHINGTON - July 29 - Today, SEIU sent a fifth “Dear John” letter to Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. SEIU members are offering assistance in the absence of any economic blueprint from McCain that puts working families first. The letters will continue until McCain personally meets with members.
<p></p>
Henry Belada, a retiree from Morganton, N.C. and a member of Local 2008, asks McCain to offer realistic steps to lower energy prices.

<p></p>
“Dear John,
<p></p>
“Your energy plan has a number of giveaways for businesses but nothing that is going to lower the price of gas. First, you said to drill more, further deepening our dependence on oil. Next, you offered up a few pie-in-the-sky words on alternative energies that might make a good press conference but are little more than unrealistic gimmicks.
<p></p>
“Unfortunately for the millions of working families struggling with record energy prices, your proposals won’t help us today or anytime soon. You won’t solve our energy crisis by drilling more today and putting off the tough decisions. Americans need help, not an IOU.
<p></p>
“Your alternative plan relies on technologies that won’t even exist for decades. $5,000 tax credits for zero-emissions cars not available for purchase doesn’t help a father afford the cost gas to get to work today. A $300 million prize for extended-life vehicle batteries won’t help a mother trying to decide if she should buy a $4 gallon of gas or a $4 gallon of milk.
<p></p>
“Instead, close the so-called Enron loophole and hold an investigation of market manipulation by speculators so prices come down today. It will help businesses and consumers - today. You current plan is just a continuation of the policies of George W. Bush — drill, drill, drill, and pretend the future will take care of itself.”
