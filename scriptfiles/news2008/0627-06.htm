WASHINGTON - June 27 - Yesterday, the Federal Communications Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to address the use of product integration in television. </p><p></p><p><strong>Ben Scott</strong>, policy director of Free Press, issued the following statement: </p><p></p><p>"We are pleased to see the Federal Communications Commission begin to address the growing prevalence of product integration. As the line between programming and advertising becomes blurred, consumers are increasingly saturated with ads before, after and during programs. We applaud the FCC for taking up the question of how programmers should disclose to consumers who is paying for what is embedded in creative content. </p><p></p><p>"We firmly believe the FCC should seriously consider 'real time' disclosure in their deliberations. Disclosing integrated ads on the screen at the time of their presentation gives viewers a clear understanding of what they are watching. In the age of TiVo, placing a disclosure during opening or closing credits simply does not properly inform consumers about how their favorite shows have been blended with commercials. We look forward to working with the FCC to ensure that viewers are aware of product integration at the moment it occurs." </p><p></p>
