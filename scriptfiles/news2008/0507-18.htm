<b>What:</b>  Nancy Pelosi and George Bush in Bed Together 
<p></p>

<b>When :</b> Thursday, May 8, 2008
<p></p>

<b>Times:</b> 7am Washington Harbour Condominiums 3030 K St NW, Washington, DC <br>

            12noon Capitol Building sidewalk @  Independence and New Jersey   <br>

            4pm Speaker Pelosi's office, Cannon 235  (possible arrests)  <p></p>
                   
 
 CODEPINK condemns Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for her backroom maneuvering, guaranteeing George Bush $162.6 billion more for war. Admitting abdication to the Executive Branch, the Speaker recently stated,  ''We would rather just save time and get it over with right from the start.'' CODEPINK's response, "So where is the democratic leadership? In bed with George Bush!"  
<p></p>
CODEPINK will take a bed with masks of Bush and Pelosi to her DC home and the Capitol on Thursday. "We've seen this charade too many times: Pelosi allows the Democratic legislators to posture as war opponents, while assuring that the necessary votes to pass more war funding," says  Medea Benjamin, co-founder of CODEPINK. "This time she's even adding money for 2009 to avoid another funding vote on the eve of the November election. It's immoral and unconscionable! That's why we'll show her in bed with George Bush."
 <p></p>
 CODEPINK has been camping out in front of Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco house to demand that the speaker be a true leader and stop buying Bush's war. They will take the camp to her DC condo in Georgetown every morning and evening during this vote. "Instead of political posturing and backroom deals, Pelosi should stand up to Bush to stop the war," states CODEPINK member Desiree Fairooz. "We're outraged."
