<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 4 -  For only the 12th time in its entire history, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has begun the veto process to kill an environmentally devastating project. </p>
<p>For the past 67 years, the Army Corps of Engineers has been trying to convince America to waste more than 200 million dollars, to drain more than 300 square miles of wetlands in Northwestern Mississippi. Such an area is equal to the size of New York City, including all 5 boroughs.</p>

<p>Below is a statement from Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers:</p>

<p>“One of the most environmentally disastrous ideas of the last half century is now one step closer to being thrown into the trash where it belongs. The Environmental Protection Agency has lived up to its name by showing the courage to stand up against this wasteful project. </p>
<p>However, the Yazoo Pumps aren’t dead just yet. This project has often been called the monster that just won’t die. For almost 70 years, right thinking people have been beating the monster down. Today is the beginning of the end of this long journey, but we have many more steps to take together. It’s up to all of us to thank the EPA, and encourage it to continue its journey down this road. When we finally reach the finish line, these monumentally important wetlands will be protected, as will the communities that depend on them.”
