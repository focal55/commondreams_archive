PHOENIX - August 7 - The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion yesterday to hold 
Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio in contempt for disobeying a court order 
that would allow women prisoners in Maricopa County to obtain timely, safe, and 
legal abortions. In addition, today's motion asks the court to provide 
additional safeguards for women prisoners seeking abortion care.</p>
<p>"Arizona courts have clearly ruled that prison officials cannot stand in the 
way of the medical needs of women prisoners," said Brigitte Amiri, a staff 
attorney for the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project. "It's regrettable that we 
need to take extra steps to ensure that Sheriff Arpaio follows the law."</p>

<p>At issue in the original case was an unwritten Maricopa County Jail policy 
prohibiting jail officials from transporting a prisoner to obtain an abortion 
unless she first got a court order. In August 2005, the Superior Court of 
Arizona, Maricopa County, struck down the unwritten policy, holding that it 
violated women's reproductive rights and served "no legitimate penological 
purpose." The Arizona Court of Appeals upheld that decision; both the Arizona 
and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case.</p>
<p>In May of 2008, prison officials defied the courts by continuing to enforce 
the unwritten policy when a woman prisoner, "Mary Roe," requested transportation 
for an abortion. When Roe's lawyer spoke with Sheriff Arpaio's Deputy Chief, 
John McIntyre, who had been involved in the original case and knew the court's 
decision, he failed to tell her that inmates must be transported for abortion 
care without a court order. It took the ACLU's intervention to ensure that 
prison officials followed the law; still, their initial non-compliance delayed 
Roe's abortion by four weeks. </p>
<p>"The courts have already confirmed our position that Arizona prison officials 
cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree 
with the decision to end a pregnancy," said Alessandra Soler Meetze, Executive 
Director of the ACLU of Arizona. "Now, given the disregard of the court ruling 
by Sheriff Arpaio and his staff, it appears that we need to spell out the law 
more clearly to protect future women detainees."</p>
<p>The motion asks the court to require the jail to post signs in both English 
and Spanish informing prisoners of their right to be transported. In addition, 
all employees would be required to sign a statement acknowledging that they have 
been informed of the law.</p>
<p>Today's case is <em>Doe v. Arpaio</em>, CV2004-009286.&nbsp; Lawyers on the case 
include Amiri and Talcott Camp with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, and 
Dan Pochoda of the ACLU of Arizona. </p>
