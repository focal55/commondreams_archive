SACRAMENTO - June 30 - A new regulation goes into effect 
tomorrow requiring hunters to use only non-lead ammunition when in the 
endangered California condor’s habitat. The California Legislature passed the 
historic measure last year to keep condors from becoming poisoned after 
swallowing lead bullets or bullet fragments when they feed on animal carcasses 
that have been shot with this highly toxic ammunition. </p>
<p>“Efforts to bring the critically endangered California condor 
back from the brink of extinction have been severely hampered by the use of lead 
in ammunition,” said Pamela Flick, 
California program coordinator for 
Defenders of Wildlife. “We’ve known about the dangers of lead for decades. 
That’s why we keep it out of our homes and schools. Finally, we have taken steps 
to protect imperiled wildlife and the environment from this toxic 
substance.”</p>
<p>More than 276 cases of lead poisoning have been documented in 
California condors in the past 
eight years. And at least seven cases have appeared this spring, with one 
resulting in a death during treatment at the Los Angeles Zoo. While lead 
poisoning ranks as the leading cause of death among 
California condors, dozens more 
deaths not directly caused by poisoning are likely related to lead exposure. 
</p>
<p>In recent years, studies have shown increased levels of lead 
in many species of animals in condor habitat. The lead has even made a full 
circle – elevated levels of lead exposure have also been observed in humans who 
ate game killed with lead bullets or shot. </p>
<p>The new regulation covers the California condor’s current and 
historic range, encompassing the horseshoe-shaped region from Big 
Sur, south to Ventura 
and east through the southern Sierra Nevada. All hunting 
of big game, non-game mammals and non-game birds in the condor’s territory now 
requires the use of non-lead centerfire ammunition certified by the California 
Fish and Game Commission. More information about the area covered by the ban and 
certified ammunition can be found at the <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/wildlife/hunting/condor/" target="_new">Department of Fish and 
Game’s Web site.</a>
</p><p>“We are grateful that the Legislature and commission have 
taken this important action to protect one of 
California’s most important 
animals, the iconic condor, from lead poisoning and related deaths,” Flick said. 
“California’s dedication to 
educating hunters and keeping lead out of the environment will benefit wildlife 
and humans for generations to come.” &nbsp;</p>
