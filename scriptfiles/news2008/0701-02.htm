WASHINGTON - July 1 - By July 1st, water customers around the country will have received water quality reports from their local utility.&nbsp; Faced with fine print and scary chemical names, many consumers might be tempted to just buy bottled water, even though their tap water may be every bit as clean, pure and healthy as the brands marketed as such by bottled water companies. To help consumers make informed choices about the water they drink, Food &amp; Water Watch is releasing a guide to understanding water quality reports.</p>

<p>Amendments made in 1996 to the Safe Drinking Water Act require utility companies to tell the public what is in their water. Yet sometimes this information is confusing and full of jargon.&nbsp; Food &amp; Water Watch’s <em>How to Read Your Water Quality Report</em> teaches consumers how to learn, among other things:</p>
<ul><li>The source of their drinking water, be it a river, lake, groundwater aquifer or some other body of water</li><li>The susceptibility of their water to contamination </li><li>EPA regulations for drinking water contaminants </li><li>What contaminants may exist in their water</li><li>Potential health effects of any contaminant detected at a level that violates EPA’s health standard. </li></ul>
<p><br>“Drinking water is a basic human right and every consumer should know what is in theirs,” said Wenonah Hauter, Executive Director of Food &amp; Water Watch. “Learning about the quality of their drinking water will empower consumers to make informed decisions about what they drink and serve their families. With faith in the quality of their tap water, consumers can feel confident in choosing it over expensive, wasteful bottled water.”</p>

<p>The EPA requires extensive testing of public water for both organic and inorganic contaminants. When, in some communities, public water systems fall short of consistently meeting EPA standards it is likely due to pollution of the water source, inadequate water treatment, or deteriorating infrastructure.<br><br>While Federal, state and local governments are required by the Clean Water Act to protect the quality and integrity of water sources, funding for such activities is at risk.</p>
<p>“If current spending for water infrastructure stays the same, over the next 20 years our communities will fall nearly $23 billion short annually of what they need to maintain and improve public drinking water and sewage systems,” says Hauter. “A federal clean water trust fund could provide billions of dollars, year after year, for investment in clean and safe drinking water for every community and every person in the United States.”</p>
