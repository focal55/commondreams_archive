<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 29 -The Sierra Club issued the following statement in response to President Bush’s remarks about gas prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><b>

<p align="center">Statement of Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director</p></b>

<p>"<b>Two years ago President Bush said America was addicted to oil but today he complained that we just need a bigger fix.&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>"When American families are struggling with record prices at the pump, how can we justify continuing to subsidize Big Oil&nbsp;as it rack up tens of billions in record profits?</p>

<p>"The disastrous policies of his administration have allowed the addiction to grow and energy prices to skyrocket.&nbsp; As hardworking Americans suffer and spiraling energy costs wreck the economy, the President merely trotted out more of the same policies that do nothing to help consumers, do nothing to end our dangerous dependence on oil, do nothing to bring rising energy costs back under control, and do nothing to fight global warming—something even the President recently&nbsp;admitted must be dealt with. </p>

<p>"It's no coincidence that as gas prices have surged to record highs with no end in sight that today two of the largest oil companies in the world today reported nearly $17 billion in profits.&nbsp; Yet, the president refuses to end the billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies that are helping to fuel Big Oil’s record profits.&nbsp; </p>

<p>"Instead of the failed policies of the past, it's time to break our addiction to fossil fuels by shifting our priorities—and our policies—toward creating the clean energy economy.&nbsp; It's time to take back the giveaways to Big Oil and invest that money in clean, renewable energy and efficiency.&nbsp; A serious national commitment to renewable energy will put our economy back on the path to prosperity by bringing energy costs under control, creating over 820,000 new jobs, and making us more energy independent.&nbsp; Unfortunately, President Bush has threatened to veto legislation that would do just—legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House over two months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>"Ideas like drilling in the Arctic Refuge will do nothing to lower current energy prices.&nbsp; In fact, the Bush administration itself has even admitted that drilling in the Arctic would only lower gas prices ONE CENT in some twenty years time.&nbsp; Permanently destroying one of our last remaining special places is hardly worth it for a penny in twenty years. Drilling these places won’t do anything to ease pain at the pump or create energy independence. America simply doesn’t have enough oil to impact prices on the world market since we sit on <i>less than three percent</i> of the world's reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The honest answer to our addition to fossil fuels is to use less of them, and that means better fuel economy, a serious commitment to renewable energy, and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency."</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
