<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 12 - On June 6-8, several thousand activists, journalists, scholars, policymakers and concerned citizens from across the country will gather at the Minneapolis Convention Center for the 2008 National Conference for Media Reform, hosted by Free Press. Now in its fourth installment, this unique event is the largest gathering of media reform advocates in the country. <br><br>“This is a critical year for our country — and the future of our media,” said <b>Josh Silver</b>, executive director of Free Press, the national, nonpartisan media reform group that organizes the conference. “There’s a growing movement for better media in America that wants more quality journalism, a diversity of voices on the public airwaves, and a free and open Internet. After years of fighting to prevent a bad system from getting worse, the National Conference for Media Reform will focus on advancing bold visions for the future of the media and finding concrete solutions to get us there.” <br><br>Among the speakers already confirmed are legendary journalists <b>Bill Moyers</b> of PBS and <b>Dan Rather</b>, former anchor of CBS News; North Dakota <b>Sen. Byron Dorgan</b>; FCC Commissioners <b>Michael Copps</b> and <b>Jonathan Adelstein</b>; <b>Arianna Huffington</b> of HuffingtonPost.com; <b>Amy Goodman</b> and <b>Juan Gonzalez</b>, co-hosts of Democracy Now!; <b>Naomi Klein</b>, author of <i>No Logo</i> and <i>The Shock Doctrine</i>; law professors <b>Lawrence Lessig</b> of Stanford and <b>Tim Wu</b> of Columbia; <b>Van Jones</b> of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights; <b>Katrina vanden Heuvel</b>, editor of <i>The Nation</i>; <b>Malkia Cyril</b> of the Center for Media Justice; <b>Rev. Lennox Yearwood</b>, CEO of the Hip Hop Caucus; and media scholar <b>Robert W. McChesney</b>, co-founder of Free Press. <br><br>Over three days, the National Conference for Media Reform will feature more than 60 panels focused on media policy, grassroots activism, journalism, civil rights and new technology. The Minneapolis event will build on the success of last year’s conference in Memphis, which was attended by nearly 3,500 people. <br><br>Press credentials for the National Conference for Media Reform are available to members of the media who will be covering the event. <br><br>Request press credentials by filling out the online application: <a href="http://free.convio.net/site/PageNavigator/NCMR08/NCMRPressApplication" target="_new">http://free.convio.net/site/PageNavigator/NCMR08/NCMRPressApplication</a> <br>
