<p>NEW YORK - April 29 - In honor of National Volunteer Week, Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) is celebrating its history as a volunteer-driven organization. More than 90 years ago, Planned Parenthood began as an all-volunteer organization. Today more than 20,000 volunteers donate their time to ensure that family planning and other vital reproductive health care and information are available in communities across the country.
<p>“Our volunteers are incredibly dedicated to the mission of keeping women, men, and teens healthy and safe,” said PPFA President Cecile Richards (<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/national-leadership/cecile-richards.htm">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/national-leadership/cecile-richards.htm</a>). “Five million people worldwide rely on Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care, education, and information each year, and every day our volunteers play a role in providing and protecting those services.”</p>

<p>Planned Parenthood volunteers serve in a wide range of capacities, including support for health care clients, administrative work, educational programs for women, men, and teens, and outreach to underserved populations. They also engage in a variety of advocacy activities to voice their support for increased access to reproductive health care and medically accurate sex education. </p>
<p>This year, Planned Parenthood volunteers are explaining why they volunteer through essays and videos. You can read and hear about their passion for ensuring access to reproductive health care here.

<p>In addition, this year PPFA honored two outstanding volunteers at the Planned Parenthood National Conference in the Washington, DC, area:</p>
<p>Karen Campbell, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin <br>2008 Volunteer of the Year Award Recipient</p>
<p>Karen Campbell has been a frontline volunteer as a health center educator and escort and has led the Wisconsin organization as board chair.&nbsp; Her commitment and involvement in reproductive health and rights span 10 years, and her leadership, energy, and sheer dedication set an excellent example to other Planned Parenthood volunteers and staff.</p>
<p>Harrison Pride, Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette<br>2008 Young Volunteer of the Year Award Recipient</p>

<p>Harrison Pride is a key member of the Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette Teen Council Peer Education Program. Because of his work as a peer educator, he is well-known in his school as a safe and confidential resource for his peers who need reassurance, information, and services. His passion is contagious, and he inspires others to become informed, make wise decisions, and support reproductive rights.</p>

Planned Parenthood affiliates operate more than 860 health centers nationwide, providing medical services and sexuality education for millions of women, men, and teenagers each year. We also work with allies worldwide to ensure that all women and men have the right and the means to meet their sexual and reproductive health care needs.
