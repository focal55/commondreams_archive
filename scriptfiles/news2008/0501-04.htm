<p>NATIONWIDE - May 1 - On the fifth anniversary of President Bush's announcement of the end of "major combat operations" in Iraq, Military Families Speak Out issued the following statement calling on Congress to reject any appropriation continuing funding for the war in Iraq, and instead fully fund the safe and swift return of all U.S. troops.

 
<P></P>
Five years ago today, President Bush stood on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln under a banner reading "Mission Accomplished" and proclaimed that "Major combat operations in Iraq have ended."

 <P></P>

And yet today our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, sisters and brothers are still fighting in the streets of Basra and Baghdad in a war that should never have started.  51 of our troops died in Iraq last month – the highest death toll since September, 2007 when reports began hailing that the so-called “surge” – the escalation of the war – was “working”.  And in Sadr City alone over 400 Iraqi children, women, and men have been killed and over 2,400 have been wounded in the past month's fighting.

 <P></P>

In November, 2006, the American people elected a Congress that they believed would end the war in Iraq.  A year and half later, this mission remains unaccomplished. Instead, Congressional leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. John Murtha are reported to be planning to give President Bush the funds to continue this nightmare well into 2009 so they can avoid a controversy-laden vote on war funding in the weeks leading up to this November's election. And we are being told to once again wait for an election, to wait for a new President to get us out of Iraq.

 <P></P>

We can't afford the human cost of waiting to end this unjust and unjustifiable war.  We know that another year of war will mean the deaths of hundreds of U.S. troops, and tens of thousands of Iraqi children, women, and men. We know that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is affecting more and more service members, and that suicide rates among those who have served in combat are skyrocketing. We know that our loved ones and their families are suffering each and every day that this war is allowed to continue.

 
<P></P>
On this fifth anniversary of the lie on May 1, 2003 that purported that major combat operations in Iraq had ended, we are calling on Congress to complete the mission they were elected to accomplish.  Congress must not continue the betrayal of our loved ones, all of our troops, their families, this nation and the people of Iraq. They must now use their ‘power of the purse’ to ensure that no more funds are appropriated to continue the war in Iraq; and that the swift and safe return of our troops, and the care they need when they get home, are fully funded.

 
<P></P>
Members of Military Families Speak Out are available for interview -- including families with loved ones currently serving in Iraq, families whose loved ones have died as a result of this war, families of troops who have suffered physical and psychological injuries, and families of those awaiting deployment or re-deployment.
<br>
<br>
Military Families Speak Out (MFSO) is a national organization of almost 4,000 families who are opposed to the war in Iraq and have loved ones who serve or have served in the military since the fall of 2002.<!-- #EndEditable -->
