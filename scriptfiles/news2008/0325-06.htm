<p>PHOENIX - March 25 - A local Arizona anti-solicitation ordinance targeting day laborers 
violates the free speech rights of individuals who express their availability to 
work by standing in public areas, charged the American Civil Liberties Union, 
the ACLU of Arizona and the <a href="http://www.maldefu.org/" target="_new">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>(MALDEF) in a lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court in Phoenix.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The coalition filed the lawsuit 
against the town of Cave Creek and the town’s mayor and deputy mayor on behalf 
of Hector Lopez, Leopoldo Ibarra and Ismael Ibarra, three longtime day laborers 
and Arizona residents who in the past successfully solicited employment in Cave 
Creek by standing in public areas, peaceably indicating to occupants of passing 
vehicles their availability for temporary employment. Lopez, Ibarra and Ibarra 
currently wish to make their availability for day labor known but fear that they 
will be cited or arrested for violating the ordinance.</p>

<p>“This ordinance unfairly and 
unlawfully singles out and punishes day laborers by taking away their right to 
free speech,” said Mónica Ramírez, a staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants’ 
Rights Project.&nbsp; “That’s just not 
the way America works.&nbsp; The Constitution protects all 
people in this country, and all persons have the right to communicate freely - 
particularly in public areas - regardless of their background.” 
</p>
<p>In September 2007, the Cave Creek 
Town Council passed an anti-solicitation ordinance that restricts free speech by 
prohibiting solicitation of employment, business or contributions from the 
occupants of vehicles when standing on or next to a street or highway - 
including the sidewalk. The ordinance goes so far as to bar solicitation from 
occupants in vehicles that are lawfully parked in public areas. 
</p>
<p>Before the town passed the 
ordinance, day laborers - who are usually hired by homeowners to perform 
services like gardening, moving, light construction, housework and painting - 
solicited work in public areas. </p>
<p>While the town was apparently 
motivated by a desire to target illegal immigration, the ordinance applies to 
everyone in Cave Creek, regardless of their nationality or immigration 
status.&nbsp; The ordinance is so 
overbroad that it also applies to Salvation Army bell ringers asking for holiday 
contributions and high school cheerleaders advertising a car wash on a sidewalk 
or street.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The ACLU argues that individuals, 
regardless of their immigration status, have the right to free speech which 
includes soliciting employment. </p>

<p>“By attempting to take away the 
First Amendment rights of day laborers, Cave Creek has endangered the free 
speech rights of every group in town,” said Dan Pochoda, Legal Director of the 
ACLU of Arizona. “The very people who fought to have this law passed have, in 
effect, forfeited their own First Amendment rights to peaceably solicit for 
their interest or cause.”</p>
<p>Kristina Campbell, a staff attorney 
with MALDEF, said, “The Cave Creek anti-solicitation ordinance is a clear 
violation of the First Amendment right to engage in free speech. Day laborers 
are the most visible and vulnerable segment of the immigrant population, and 
they and others who wish to exercise their First Amendment right to solicit 
employment in public places have the right to do so without fear that they will 
be targeted in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner and suffer fines and 
arrest as a result.” </p>
<p>Lawyers on the case include Ramírez 
and Cecillia D. Wang of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project; Pochoda of the ACLU 
of Arizona; and Campbell and Cynthia Valenzuela of 
MALDEF.</p>
