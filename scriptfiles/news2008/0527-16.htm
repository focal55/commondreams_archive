WASHINGTON, DC - May 27 - When President Bush and Senator McCain share a stage tonight at a high-dollar fundraiser in Phoenix, voters will be hard pressed to identify any substantial differences between the two, especially when it comes to their ideas for health care.  Bush and McCain both fail to offer real solutions to the problems of working families across the country who struggle to keep up with skyrocketing health care costs.
 <p></p>
This includes more than 800,000 residents of McCain’s own Arizona, a whopping 24 percent, that do not have any coverage.
  <p></p>
Lori Loher, a lifelong Republican persuaded her family to join her in switching their party registration to Democrat this year to vote for Senator Obama.
  <p></p>
“John McCain has been part of the broken system in DC for years.  He can’t run from his poor record on health care or hide from his support for Bush’s health care policies,” said Loher.  “With families struggling to get by, people without access to health care, and an endless war in Iraq, we need a president who is committed to real change. I’m supporting Barack Obama because he’s the only one who can turn things around and give all families a piece of the American Dream.”
  <p></p>
Last week, SEIU released a review of McCain’s disastrous health care proposals. The full report can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.seiu.org" target="_new">www.seiu.org</a>.

SEIU members have been a dominant force in making health care a central issue in this election through strong grassroots activism and an aggressive political effort to hold elected officials accountable in their pledges to provide affordable health care and rebuild the middle class.
