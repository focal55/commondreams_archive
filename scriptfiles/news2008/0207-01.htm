<p>NEW YORK - February 7 - As the political response to the violence in Kenya moves into a new phase of negotiations, MADRE supports Kenyan women’s groups demanding a voice at the negotiating table.
<P></P>
This week, the Kenya Red Cross reported that the death toll in Kenya now exceeds 1,000 people, with another 300,000 uprooted from their homes. Negotiations between the rival political parties, mediated by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, have progressed fitfully. Meanwhile, reports of sexual violence against women have more than doubled, particularly in the displacement camps.
<P></P>
A coalition of Kenyan women’s groups recently facilitated a consultation in Nairobi, presenting their findings to the mediation team. This document details the key role that women must play in resolving this conflict and lays out concrete solutions. The full text of analysis and recommendations contained in the women’s memorandum is available here: <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200801310664.html" target="_new">http://allafrica.com/stories/200801310664.html</a>.
<P></P>
Vivian Stromberg, MADRE’s Executive Director, said today, “In Kenya and in similar situations around the world, violence impacts women disproportionately. Women are targeted with rape as a political weapon, designed to traumatize communities. Women have less access to already-limited health and humanitarian aid services, and women’s voices are shut out from negotiations. Kenyan women’s groups are standing up to this unjust dynamic and proposing solutions grounded in their expertise. Any further negotiations must thoroughly incorporate their perspectives.”
<P></P>
MADRE also released an analysis of US and international media coverage of the violence in Kenya, titled “Inequality, Not Identity, Fuels Violence in Kenya.” This paper is available here: <a href="http://www.madre.org/articles/afr/kenyainequality020608.html" target="_new">http://www.madre.org/articles/afr/kenyainequality020608.html</a>.
