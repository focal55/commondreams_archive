WASHINGTON, DC - May 8 -The American Civil Liberties Union was encouraged by today’s 
Senate Finance Committee hearing on service delivery problems with the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) field offices. The SSA has struggled in processing 
disability claims in reasonable timeframes and the ACLU has concerns that a 
mandatory employment verification system would capsize the already overburdened 
agency.</p>

<p>"Disabled Americans are waiting upwards of two years to receive Social 
Security benefits. Now is not the time for Congress to impose a radical new duty 
on SSA – the verification of every worker in the U.S.," said Caroline 
Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Over half of 
all calls made to SSA field offices across the country go unanswered. Congress 
should focus on giving SSA the resources necessary to execute its critical 
functions of processing disability, retirement, and survivor benefits, and 
reject mandatory electronic employment verification."</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress are currently considering legislation that would 
implement mandatory electronic employment verification systems. These systems 
would place the verification responsibility on the SSA, requiring that job 
applicants’ documentation is accurate and in good standing before any new job 
could be accepted. In addition to disability backlogs, the SSA databases are 
fraught with errors in individual Social Security records that would prevent 
innocent Americans from working until their records are corrected.</p>
<p>"The Secure America through Verification Enforcement ("SAVE" Act) [S. 2368, 
H.R. 4088] would crush the SSA field offices," added Joanne Lin, ACLU 
Legislative Counsel. "Approximately 3.6 million workers would need to visit an 
SSA field office each year in order to correct their Social Security records, or 
lose their jobs. The SAVE Act would also require every worker with earnings 
reported by two or more employers to visit a field office annually to prove 
their identity and earnings. This translates into an additional 45 million field 
office visits per year."</p>
