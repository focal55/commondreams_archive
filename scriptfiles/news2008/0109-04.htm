<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 9 - The Center for Public Integrity has assembled an award-winning team of journalists and researchers to build one of the most comprehensive, illuminating, and frequently updated websites on presidential politics and fundraising, <a href="http://www.buyingofthepresident.org/" target="_new">The Buying of the President 2008</a> . The site provides current and historical facts and figures, along with stories that explore a variety of issues related to money in presidential politics.
 <p></p>
"The Buying of the President 2008 site is a quintessential must-read for journalists, policy makers, and political enthusiasts alike who want to broaden their curiosity and pursuit of the purse strings behind presidential campaigns," said Center Executive Director Bill Buzenberg.
  <p></p>
The site, <a href="http://www.buyingofthepresident.org/" target="_new">www.buyingofthepresident.org</a> , is a one-stop source of information about the 2008 election, featuring profiles of the candidates, their donors, and advisers, as well as the latest fundraising news. In addition, the site offers a history of U.S. presidential fundraising, complete with more than 75 in-depth interviews of current and former presidential candidates, political strategists, campaign donors, major fundraisers, and other experts. Longtime Washington journalist Sara Fritz, nationally syndicated columnist Jules Witcover, former White House correspondent John W. Mashek, and others conducted the interviews.
