WASHINGTON - July 23 - The Secular Coalition wrote to Democratic National Convention (DNC) CEO Leah Daughtry on July 2nd to convey questions and concerns about a worship event she's organizing for the DNC. Now, a July 19 Associated Press article describes Daughtry, a Pentecostal minister, as "befuddled" by "an angry letter from a secularist group." We wouldn't have characterized our letter as "angry," but we wonder: are we the befuddlers? You decide.

Dear Rev. Daughtry:
<p></p>
I am very concerned about the Interfaith Gathering at the upcoming Democratic National Convention.
<p></p>
This event is described as a "unity" event to stress the "big tent" nature of the Democratic Party; however, I have received complaints by people who identify as atheist and humanist who feel that this event excludes them as full participants in the convention.
<p></p>
Is this event open to Democrats who do not hold a god-belief? I assume your answer is yes, but I would be very interested to know how you plan to make the nontheist community feel welcomed. Without an inclusive plan you will make nontheistic Americans feel like second-class citizens at the convention.
<p></p>
If you have not considered this issue, I would be very interested in talking with you or the coordinator of this event to offer suggestions on how our community could be included. I can be reached at 202-299-1091 or by e-mail.
<p></p>
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
<p></p>
Sincerely,<p></p>
Ron Millar<br>

Associate Director <!-- #EndEditable -->
