SACRAMENTO - August 7 - The full Legislature on Thursday approved the Civil Rights Act of 2008, continuing an historic multi-year effort by Assemblymember John Laird and Equality California to modernize California's anti-discrimination laws. Assembly Bill 2654 passed the Senate with a 23-15 vote and now goes to the governor’s desk for consideration.
<p></p>
The Civil Rights Act of 2008 was designed to help ensure that Californians have the most comprehensive civil rights protections in the nation. It strengthens existing law to ensure protections based on gender, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, marital status and sexual orientation. The bill clarifies sections of law that prohibit discrimination in insurance and government services and activities. AB 2654 is co-sponsored by the California State Conference of the NAACP.

“We are pleased the Legislature has passed The Civil Rights Act of 2008, ensuring that no one is singled out to be treated differently under state law,” said EQCA Executive Director Geoff Kors. “With the leadership of Assemblymember Laird, we have created anti-bias laws in California that set the standard for the entire nation, protecting all Californians in every aspect of their lives.
<p></p>
"The Civil Rights Act of 2008, along with my four previous similar bills, corrects currently deficient anti-discrimination laws and ensures clear, consistent and comprehensive protections for all Californians," said Assemblymember Laird, D-Santa Cruz, chair of the LGBT Legislative Caucus.
