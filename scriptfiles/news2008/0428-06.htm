<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 28 -Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) will launch its national tour of a life-size Guantanamo prison cell replica in Miami, FL. AIUSA members and other activists will gather at Bayfront Park at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, May 8, 2008 in Miami to experience the cell and continue to push the Bush administration to shut down the U.S.-controlled detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
<P></P>
Larry Cox, AIUSA's executive director, will kick off the event where many participants will be dressed in Guantanamo-style orange boiler-suits. Activists will also hold signs urging the U.S. government to stop torture, halt indefinite detention practices, and end the use of secret prisons. Visitors will be encouraged to experience the interactive cell on display at the event.
<P></P>
This cell replica will visit cities and towns across the United States. The cell is designed to provide all visitors with a tangible glimpse into the life of a Guantanamo detainee. The replica includes a steel toilet, florescent lights, frosted windows and a sliding metal door. Many detainees are held in isolation in similar conditions for as long as 23 hours a day.
<P></P>
The cell replica will be on exhibit at Bayfront Park on Thursday, May 8 (1-8 p.m.), Friday and Saturday, May 9-10 (10 a.m.-8 p.m.) and Sunday, May 11 (10 a.m.-6 p.m.). Visitors may tour the cell and record a 30-second reaction video that will be posted on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_new">youtube.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tearitdown.org" target="_new">tearitdown.org</a> to sign the global petition to shut Guantanamo down.
<P></P>
In addition to the launch event, the public is invited to Jamnesty, a concert to be held at Bayfront Park on Saturday, May 10th, from 1-8 p.m.
