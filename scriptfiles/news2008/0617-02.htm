WASHINGTON, DC - June 17 - Congressman Lloyd Doggett (D - Texas), a long-time environmental champion, has introduced a new bill to reduce the pollution that causes global warming, the Climate Market Auction, Trust and Trade Emissions Reduction System (MATTERS) Act. A group of environmental, conservation and science organizations issued the following statement:
<p></p>
"More and more House members are recognizing the urgent need to take strong action on global warming policy. Congressman Doggett's new bill and the soon-to-be-held hearing on it in the House Ways and Means Committee demonstrate growing momentum in Congress to address global warming. Leaders such as Congressman Doggett understand we need long-term solutions to our energy problems and that we must start building a clean energy economy now in order to effectively reduce the pollution that causes global warming, while also addressing global warming's harmful impacts on vulnerable communities, infrastructure, and natural resources.
<p></p>
"The bill has strong, science-based targets for cutting global warming pollution to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 economy-wide. In addition to setting targets for covered sectors, the bill also recognizes the importance of reducing pollution from other sectors to ensure that we can prevent the worst consequences of global warming.
<p></p>
"Additionally, Doggett's bill contains strong provisions for implementing a cap-and-trade program, especially when it comes to auctioning pollution allowances. Under cap-and-trade systems, auctioning pollution allowances increases transparency, avoids windfall profits for polluters, and helps ensure that the market sets an accurate price on polluting. Auctioning allowances can give polluters strong financial incentive to innovate, deploy clean technology and achieve deep pollution reductions. Doggett's bill builds on the best practices of cap-and-trade policy by calling for 85 percent auctioning of allowances initially and moves quickly to 100 percent auctions by 2020.
<p></p>
"We look forward to working with Congressman Doggett and all the environmental champions in the House who want to pass strong, science-based global warming legislation."<!-- #EndEditable -->
