	WASHINGTON, DC - May 21 - On May 19th, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) sent an ethics complaint against Rep. Vito Fossella (R-NY) to the House Ethics Committee, asking for an investigation into whether he violated any House rules. Today, the Ethics Committee voted to establish an investigative subcommittee to conduct an investigation on the DWI charge, but immediately recommended that the subcommittee defer action on its investigation until Fossella’s criminal proceedings are concluded.</p>
<p>Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said today, “The Ethics Committee deferred an investigation of Vito Fossella?  We are shocked, shocked, shocked.  The only thing more shocking would be if the committee decided to investigate anything…ever.”</p>

<p><em>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is a non-profit legal watchdog group dedicated to holding public officials accountable for their actions.</em></p>
