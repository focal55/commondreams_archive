<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 8 - The Hate Hurts America Community and Interfaith Coalition (HHA) today announced that five more radio advertisers have joined a growing list of companies that have stopped advertising or refuse to place their ads on Michael Savage's "Savage Nation" radio program.
<P></P>
HHA said the advertisers - ITT Technical Institute, Chattem, Inc. (owners of Gold Bond, Icy Hot, and Selsun Blue), Union Bank of California, Intuit (parent company of TurboTax and QuickBooks), and GEICO Insurance - dropped their commercials after being contacted by visitors to the newly-created "No Savage" website.
<P></P>
That site, a project of Brave New Films, also contains examples of bigoted on-air comments by Savage targeting Muslims, immigrants and women, as well as contact information for remaining advertisers.
<P></P>

<P></P>
An ITT Tech official stated: "It was brought to our attention this week that ITT Tech spots had been heard in the Michael Savage Show. As a result, we have contacted all stations participating in the ITT Tech program and strongly reiterated that they are NOT to run ITT Tech spots in the Michael Savage Show."
<P></P>
A letter from GEICO's media buyer said: "We have contacted all our affiliate(s) to ensure that GEICO advertisements, including any inadvertent errors, will not appear on the Savage Nation."
<P></P>
HHA, a group of religious and civic organizations seeking to challenge hate speech on talk radio, was formed as a result of Savage's rhetorical attacks on religious and ethnic minorities. Coalition members are calling on advertisers nationwide to stop airing commercials on Savage's nationally-syndicated program.

<P></P>
Late last year, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners of all faiths to contact Savage's advertisers to express their concerns about the host's anti-Muslim bigotry. CAIR is a member of the Hate Hurts America Community and Interfaith Coalition.

<P></P>
Savage has a long history of rhetorical attacks on a variety of minority groups. He says he has lost at least $1 million in revenue because of the advertiser campaign.

Advertisers that have already stopped airing or refuse to air commercials on "Savage Nation" include US Cellular, Sprint Nextel, Sears, Universal Orlando Resorts, AutoZone, Citrix, TrustedID, JCPenney, OfficeMax, Wal-Mart, and AT&T.
<P></P>
The Hate Hurts America Community and Interfaith Coalition includes public officials and civil rights advocates, as well as representatives of the Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Latino, and Asian communities.<!-- #EndEditable -->
