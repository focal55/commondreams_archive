<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 12 - Peace Action capitalizes on a tight Democratic race to highlight the nuances of each candidate's stance on Peace Issues.
<P></P>
The race for the Democratic nomination for President continues today as people from the District, Maryland, and Virginia go to the polls.  The top contenders in the Democratic race are still running the race in a virtual tie allowing primary voters in the Mid-Atlantic to have an unprecedented role in the election process.
<P></P>
Focusing efforts at Democratic rally events and at polling places Peace Action engaged thousands of voters; providing informational guides, and gauging public perception on peace issues.  "Our Peace Voter 2008 campaign is not about electing any particular candidate, but about using the elections to build support for a change in our country's foreign policy, and about building power," observed Kevin Martin, Peace Action's Executive Director. "As a society, we have become far too consumerist and detached from our democracy, ceding enormous power to politicians and narrow special interests and corporations. Peace Voter is ultimately about ordinary people reclaiming our power and our democracy."
<P></P>
One first time voter, speaking from the Obama rally at University of Maryland yesterday, said, "Obama is different for all the other candidates because he is willing to work with people who disagree with him.  He's the only candidate who is willing to meet with Iran and bring Republicans into a productive conversation about healthcare."
<P></P>
At a polling place in Washington's Northwest neighborhood one Clinton supporter claimed, "I'm voting for Hillary because the stakes are too high for a green candidate.  Hillary knows about Washington – she knows how to work the political system."
<P></P>
Peace Action kicked off its Peace Voter website (<a href="http://www.peacevoter.org" target="_new">www.peacevoter.org</a>) just before Super Tuesday but local affiliates, nationwide, have been actively engaging voters since last summer.  
<P></P>
Peace Voter provides resources for the voting public on becoming involved in democracy.  The website provides helpful platform information on each of the candidates, resources for organizing voters in your community, and helpful links for registration.<!-- #EndEditable -->
