<b>SPECS:</b>                       Detailed findings to be released informing the public about potentially harmful shower curtains routinely sold at multiple retail outlets. These curtains can release as many as 108 volatile chemicals into the air. 
 
<br>

                                    CHEJ's report mirrors and expands upon 2002 EPA testing, which found that PVC shower curtains released chemicals classified as hazardous air pollutants by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.      
 <br>


                                    Some of the chemicals found in both reports can cause damage to the liver, central nervous, respiratory and reproductive systems. 
 <br>


In addition to report findings, recommendations will be made to protect consumers and safer, available, alternatives will be presented for consumer benefit.

 <i>CHEJ mentors a movement building healthier communities by empowering people to prevent harm caused by chemical and toxic threats. We accomplish our work through programs focusing on different types of environmental health threats. CHEJ also works with communities to empower groups by providing the tools, direction, and encouragement they need to advocate for human health, to prevent harm and to work towards environmental integrity. Following her successful effort to prevent further harm for families living in contaminated Love Canal, Lois Gibbs founded CHEJ to continue the journey. To date, CHEJ has assisted over 10,000 groups nationwide. <a href="http://www.chej.org" target="_new">http://www.chej.org</a>.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
