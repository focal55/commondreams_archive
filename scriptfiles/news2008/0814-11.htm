NEW DELHI - August 14 - The India Resource Center can confirm that the Coca-Cola company has shut down another bottling plant in India - in Sinhachawar in Ballia district in Uttar Pradesh.
<p></p>
A community-led campaign had demanded the closure of the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Sinhachawar because of indiscriminate pollution by the bottling plant as well as illegal occupation of land. 
<p></p>
The India Resource Center had led a fact finding team to the plant 
            in June 2007 and <a href="http://www.indiaresource.org/news/2007/1046.html">found shocking incidences of pollution</a> that were 
            in complete violation of environmental laws and regulations in India. 
            <p></p>
            While the community knew that the plant had been un-operational since 
            the fact finding visit, this is the first official confirmation of 
            the closure. 
            <p></p>
            The bottling plant in Sinhachawar was a Coca-Cola franchisee owned 
            unit operated by the Brindavan Bottlers Limited, which is owned by 
            India's largest bottler of Coca-Cola, the Ladhani Group of Companies. 
            <p></p>

            In a <a href="http://www.indiaresource.org/campaigns/coke/images/cokeletterbalia.jpg" target="_NEW">letter</a> to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board dated October 
            27, 2007, Brindavan Bottlers informed the Board about the closure 
            of the plant due to "huge" and "unbearable" financial losses. 
            <p></p>
			The letter was dated three days after a <a href="http://www.indiaresource.org/news/2007/1054.html" target="_new">major protest</a> at the plant.
			<p></p>
            "We welcome the official closure of the bottling plant which we had 
            demanded. We will now hold Coca-Cola accountable for the damages they 
            have caused in the area because of their negligence," said Mrs. Chinta 
            Dewi, sarpanch (head of the village council) and member of the locally 
            based Coca-Cola Bhagao, Krishi Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (Get Rid of 
            Coke, Save Farming Struggle Committee). 
            <p></p>
            Another Coca-Cola bottling plant - in Plachimada in Kerala - has been 
            shut down since March 2004 due to community opposition. 
            <p></p>

            "Community campaigns in India have shut down Coca-Cola bottling plants 
            in Plachimada and in Balia, and now we will ensure that Coca-Cola 
            bottling plants in Mehdiganj and Kala Dera also meet the same fate," 
            said Nandlal Master of Lok Samiti, a community group challenging Coca-Cola's 
            operations in Mehdiganj, near Varanasi. Lok Samiti worked very closely 
            with the community in Sinhachawar towards the plant's closure. 
            
			            The Coca-Cola company is also the target of intense community campaigns 
            in Mehdiganj and Kala Dera in India for creating water shortages and 
            pollution. The company was forced to agree to an assessment of its 
            bottling operations in India as a result of a sustained international 
            campaign. The assessment, released in January 2008, was a <a href="http://www.indiaresource.org/news/2008/1001.html" target="_new">damning 
            indictment of Coca-Cola's water management practices</a> in India. The 
            assessment recommends that Coca-Cola shut down its bottling plant 
            in Kala Dera because the plant contributes significantly to water 
            shortages in the area. 
            <p></p>
            "The Coca-Cola company has chosen to embark on an ambitious public 
            relations drive to paint a green image of itself globally. But Coca-Cola's 
            track record on the ground in India is one of dismal environmental 
            and human rights problems, and no amount of public relations can solve 
            the problems it continues to create in India," said Amit Srivastava 
            of the India Resource Center, an international campaigning organization 
            that works directly with communities in India to challenge Coca-Cola. 
            <p></p>
            The fact finding team in June 2007 found several cases of pollution, 
            including: <br>
            
            <ul>
              <li>The bottling plant has indiscriminately dumping its sludge, 
                considered to be industrial hazardous waste, across the plant 
                premises, in complete violation of the laws regarding handling 
                and disposal of industrial hazardous waste in India. </li>

              <li>The Effluent Treatment Plant was non-operational, and the bottling 
                plant was discharging its wastewater into surrounding agricultural 
                fields and a canal that feeds into the river Ganges. </li>
              <li>The plant did not disclose the amount of hazardous waste being 
                used and generated, as required by the Supreme Court of India 
                for all industrial units in India that deal with hazardous waste.</li>
            </ul>
