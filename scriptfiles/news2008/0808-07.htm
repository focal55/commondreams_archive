SALT LAKE CITY - August 8 -Have you had a memorable encounter with wildlife in 
America’s national forests or on Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) lands? Your story could win you prizes worth up to $1000 while helping to 
ensure the future of the landscapes and wildlife that make 
America a great place for outdoor adventures! </p>
<p>“We want to hear why 
America’s wildlife and public lands are important to the people 
who use them most,” says Marcia Lesky, the director of national outreach at 
Defenders of Wildlife. “Whether you’re a hiker, climber, kayaker, hunter, 
angler, birder or outdoor photographer, whatever motivates you to explore our 
nation’s wild places, we want to hear about it.”</p>
<p>The “Your Lands, Your Wildlife, 
Your Story” contest from Defenders of Wildlife is an opportunity for fans of 
America’s public lands to share their stories. Six great prizes 
are up for grabs, including $1,000 in gift cards to REI for the best overall 
story. </p>
<p>The contest kicks off at the 
Outdoor Retailer Summer Market, an annual outdoor retailer expo, as part of a 
Defenders campaign to raise awareness for the importance of wildlife management 
planning on public lands and to give a voice to the people who use these lands 
most. </p>
<p>Defenders will accept 
submissions through Nov. 30, 2008 at <a href="http://www.YourLandsYourWildlife.org" target="_new">www.YourLandsYourWildlife.org</a> 
or by direct mail. Submissions will be accepted in five categories: hunting, 
fishing, birding, wildlife watching and photography, and backcountry adventure. 
The contest winners will be announced in January, 2009.</p>

Your Lands, Your Wildlife, Your Story contest, or for electronic copies of the
