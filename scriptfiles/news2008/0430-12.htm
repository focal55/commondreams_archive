<p>NEW YORK - April 30 - On Sat., May 3, in Birmingham, AL, $93,000 of unpaid “war taxes” -- federal income taxes -- will be publicly redirected away from the Internal Revenue Service to a New Orleans health clinic and to a group in the Middle East aiding Iraqi refugees. This redirection ceremony will take place during a meeting of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee.

 
<P></P>
For reasons of conscience, over 520 people from 44 states have “boycotted” $325,000 of their 2007 federal taxes. Of that total, $50,000 has been designated for the Common Ground Health Clinic in New Orleans and the Direct Aid Initiative will receive $43,000. The remaining $232,000 has been designated for scores of other humanitarian projects in the United States and around the world. These taxpayers are committing civil disobedience to demonstrate to Congress how to cut off the funds for this war and redirect resources to the pressing needs of people.
<P></P>
 

The money will provide healthcare to survivors of Katrina and refugees from the Iraq war, living in Jordan and Syria. (For details on each project, see <a href="http://www.cghc.org" target="_new">www.cghc.org</a> or <a href="http://www.directaidiraq.org" target="_new">www.directaidiraq.org</a>.).

 <P></P>

The National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee is a 25-year-old coalition of groups who support war tax resisters.
