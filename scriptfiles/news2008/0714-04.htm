WASHINGTON - July 14 - A transition to renewable energy sources promises 
significant global job gains at a time when the coal industry has been 
hemorrhaging jobs for years, according to the latest <i><a href="/node/5821" title="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5821">Vital Signs Update</a> 
</i>released by the Worldwatch Institute. 
</p>
<p>
The coal, oil, 
and natural gas industries require steadily fewer jobs as high-cost production 
equipment takes the place of human capital. Many hundreds of thousands of coal 
mining jobs have been shed in China, the United 
States, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and South Africa during the last two 
decades, sometimes in the face of expanding production. In the United 
States alone, coal industry employment has 
fallen by half in the last 20 years, despite a one-third increase in 
production.
</p>
<p>
"Renewables are 
poised to tackle our energy crisis and create millions of new jobs worldwide," 
according to Worldwatch Senior Researcher Michael Renner. "Meanwhile, fossil fuel jobs are increasingly becoming 
fossils themselves, as coal mining communities and others worry about their 
livelihoods."
</p>
<p>
Strong government 
support has allowed Germany, 
Spain, and Denmark 
to emerge as leaders in renewable energy development-and green jobs. The German 
government reports that the country was home to an estimated 259,000 direct and 
indirect jobs in the renewables sector in 2006. This figure is expected to reach 
400,000-500,000 by 2020, and 710,000 by 2030. In the United 
States, the renewables sector employed close to 
200,000 people directly and 246,000 indirectly in 2006, due mostly to leadership 
at the state level. China is rapidly catching up in 
manufacturing of solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines and is already the 
dominant global force in solar hot water development. 
</p>

<p>
An estimated 2.3 
million people worldwide currently work either directly in renewables or 
indirectly in supplier industries. The solar thermal industry employs at least 
624,000 people, the wind power industry 300,000, and the solar PV industry 
170,000. More than 1 million people work in the biomass and biofuels sector, 
while small-scale hydropower employs 39,000 individuals and geothermal employs 
25,000.
</p>
<p>
These figures are 
expected to swell substantially as private investment and government support for 
alternative energy sources grow. The most optimistic analyses project that 
global wind power employment will increase to as much as 2.1 million in 2030 and 
2.8 million in 2050. Similar projections estimate that worldwide solar PV 
production alone could create as many as 6.3 million jobs by 
2030.
</p>
<p>
"Government 
officials now have yet another reason to put the full weight of their support 
behind renewables," said Renner. "In addition to protecting our planet and 
phasing out an increasingly limited resource, policies that support renewable 
energy also support job creation."
