<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 3 - On Thursday, April 3, the Bush administration’s 
Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, waived 36 laws, including 
those that ensure safe drinking water and clean air, protect wildlife and 
pristine borderlands, and conserve areas of cultural and archeological 
significance, to hasten construction of sections of border wall along the entire 
U.S./Mexico border. <strong>This blanket waiver 
is an extreme abuse of power – the Bush administration has gone too 
far.</strong>
<p><strong>Including this most recent instance, the waiver 
authority, granted by the REAL ID Act 
of 2005, has been exercised on four occasions to clear the way for wall 
construction.</strong> Thus far, two 
environmentally sensitive public lands have been trampled by the waivers. One 
waiver was used to remove vehicle barriers and replace them with a wall in the 
Barry M. Goldwater Range in Arizona; the other was used to build a border wall within 
the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area, also in 
Arizona. While previous waivers were limited to these 
specific locations, the Bush administration is now waiving laws across hundreds 
of miles in four states. <strong>This week’s 
action by Secretary Chertoff marks a new low, sweeping nearly 500 miles of 
proposed border wall construction out of the public eye and under one blanket 
waiver.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is 
time for Congress to step in and put an end to this unprecedented abuse of power 
by rethinking and amending the section of REAL 
ID Act</strong> that grants one unelected official, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, the authority to run 
roughshod over America's laws without question or repercussion.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some 
members of Congress, including Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chair of the 
House Homeland Security Committee, have already expressed their displeasure with 
the Bush administration’s abuse of the waiver 
authority:</strong></p>
<p></p><ul class="bulleted"><li><strong>Rep. 
Thompson</strong> said, “Today's waiver 
represents an extreme abuse of authority…<strong>Waiver authority should only be used as a 
last resort, not simply because the department has failed to get the job done 
through the normal process. It was meant to be an exception, not the 
rule.”</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Rep. 
Raul Grijalva</strong>, (D-Ariz.) said, 
“It is a ridiculous claim that he [Secretary Chertoff] cannot protect the border 
without overturning the National Park Service Organic Act, the Safe Drinking 
Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Antiquities Act, the Native American Graves 
Protection Act and 31 other laws…<strong>A 
waiver this broad and poorly conceived is not leadership; it is 
laziness.”
</strong></li><li><strong>Rep. 
Hilda Solis</strong> (D-Calif.) said, <strong>“This isn't the first 
time the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] has used this authority, and each 
time it has resulted in increased frustration by all 
stakeholders.”</strong></li></ul>
<p></p><p>Defenders of Wildlife and Sierra Club have 
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the Real ID 
Act provision that authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive any 
and all laws to expedite construction of the border wall. Defenders and Sierra 
Club argue that <strong>allowing an executive 
branch official to effectively repeal duly enacted laws violates fundamental 
separation of powers principles that are the foundation for our system of 
democratic governance.&nbsp;
