WASHINGTON, DC - May 15 - Today, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and VoteVets.org released an e-mail obtained from a Veterans Affairs (VA) employee directing VA staff to refrain from diagnosing soldiers and veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>
<p>On March 20, 2008 a VA hospital’s PTSD program coordinator sent an e-mail to a number of VA employees, including psychologists, social workers, and a psychiatrist stating that due to an increased number of “compensation seeking veterans,” the staff should “refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out” and they should “R/O [rule out] PTSD” and consider a diagnosis of “Adjustment Disorder” instead. The e-mail is available at <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org" target="_new">www.citizensforethics.org</a>.</p>

<p>This week, CREW sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the VA asking for all records pertaining to any guidance given regarding the diagnosis of PTSD.                      </p>
<p>Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW, said today, “It is outrageous that the VA is calling on its employees to deliberately misdiagnose returning veterans in an effort to cut costs.  Those who have risked their lives serving our country deserve far better.  First and foremost, they have a right to expect that they receive diagnoses and treatment based on their symptoms and not on the VA’s budget.  The VA should immediately reverse this and any other similar directives.”</p>
<p>Last month, the RAND Corporation released a report that found that approximately 300,000 U.S. troops are suffering from major depression or post traumatic stress from serving in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and only about half have sought treatment.</p>
<p>Jon Soltz, an Iraq War Veteran and Chairman of VoteVets.org, added, “This is an issue I take personally.  I know of many people who received a diagnosis of ‘Adjustment Disorder,’ who strongly felt they had PTSD, many of whom confirmed that suspicion with an independent diagnosis.  Many veterans believe that the government just doesn’t want to pay out the disability that comes along with a PTSD diagnosis, and this revelation will not allay their concerns.  It is crucial that we quickly get to the bottom of this, and ensure that misdiagnosing veterans is not part of some cost-cutting policy.”
