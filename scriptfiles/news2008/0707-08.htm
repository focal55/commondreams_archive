 - July 7 - On Sunday, Senator Joe Lieberman appeared on the ABC program "This Week." Lieberman, a strong supporter of John McCain, claimed that not only Israel but also Arab nations want the US to stop Iran's nuclear program.

"I would say that, obviously, Israel is first in the line of Iranian fire, and it represents an existential threat to Israel. But you know who's next? The Arab countries in the Middle East," Lieberman asserted. "And they're worried about the Iranian program and want us to act strongly to stop it." He did not say which Arab states he was talking about, nor did he quote the National Intelligence Estimate produced by US intelligence agencies that said Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003. In recent months, there have been many high-level visits between Iran and many Gulf states, as well as attempts that are being made to reestablish relations between Iran and Egypt since they were cut off in 1981.

Senator Jack Reed, who has backed Senator Barack Obama for president, said that more was needed to be done diplomatically, as military actions by Israel would have dire consequences for the region: "I think we have to seize the time. As short as it might be, we have to seize the time for a diplomatic approach sincerely."
