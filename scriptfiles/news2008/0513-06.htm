WASHINGTON, DC - May 13 -At the invitation of U.S. Congressman John Conyers, Jr. (D-MI), chairman of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary per the request of U.S. Congressman Paul Hodes (D-NH), author Allen Raymond will appear before the Judicial Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is seeking to “investigate whether a politically motivated plot subverted justice” in the infamous 2002 New Hampshire “phone jamming” case which landed Raymond in a federal prison.
<p></p>
The U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary will be asking whether the White House was involved in New Hampshire’s 2002 phone jamming scandal and whether the Department of Justice purposely mishandled the subsequent criminal investigation.  "Voting is our most sacred right," Congressman Hodes said. "If anyone, let alone the federal government, has obstructed our right to free and fair elections, it is critical that it be known."
<p></p>
Records included in Congressman Hodes’ letter show that:
<p></p><ul>
1. Twenty-two phone calls were exchanged between New Hampshire Republican officials and the White House Office of Political Affairs from 11:20 a.m. on Election Day 2002 to 2:17 a.m. the next morning, the day during which the phone jamming occurred.
<br>

2. The Republican National Committee paid over $2.5 million in legal fees resulting from criminal charges filed against defendant Tobin.
<br>

3. John Durkin (counsel for the Republican criminal defendants) was told by a DOJ prosecutor that all decisions in this case had to be approved by the Attorney General himself, a highly unusual requirement which blocked all progress on the case and delayed the conviction of James Tobin, Regional Political Director for the National Republican Party, until after the 2004 Presidential election.
<p></p></ul>
Others scheduled to appear before the committee include: 
<p></p>
 

New Hampshire Democratic Party attorney Paul Twomey.  Twomey has suggested, in a March 21 letter to Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Paul Hodes, that there “…appears to be disturbing evidence of a pattern of political interference in the Department of Justice’s investigation of the phone jamming in 2002 United States Senate election in the state of New Hampshire.”

 <p></p>

Twomey’s letter asserts that the DOJ was responsible for conflicts of interest with John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzalez; inordinate investigative delays; inappropriately low assignment of DOJ resources; a refusal to prosecute the NH Republican State Committee; and failure to take obvious investigative steps which would have lead to exposure of higher-ups.
<br>

 
<ul>
<li>Professor Mark Crispin Miller, New York University, author of Cruel and Unusual: Bush/Cheney's New World Order
</ul>
 <br>


Mr. Raymond is a seasoned political operative who held the following positions:
<br>

 
<ul></ul>
<li>Regional Political Director for Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour (now governor of Mississippi) for gubernatorial, congressional and state legislative campaigns, and GOP state committees in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
<br>
<li>Field Representative for National Republican Senatorial Committee under Chairman Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and campaign advisor to Republican U.S. Senate candidates.
<br>
<li>Chief of Staff to Republican National Committee Co-Chairman Patricia Harrison.
</ul>
