<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 21 - In response to a congressional inquiry, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) admitted that it based its determination that current
levels of BPA exposure pose no health risks on two studies sponsored by the
American Plastics Council (APC), the trade group that represents BPA
manufacturers.  One of these studies has been found to be deeply flawed by
BPA experts and the other study has not been published nor has its results
been made public.  FDA chose to ignore data from almost 100 independent,
peer-reviewed, and published animal studies that show that this chemical is
toxic at very low levels of exposure.  Many of these studies were funded by
the National Institutes of Health. BPA is chemical component used in a
number of different plastic products, including baby bottles and the lining
in canned food.
<P></P>
"I'm not sure what's worse -- that FDA ignored almost 100 independent
peer-reviewed studies expressing concerns over low-level BPA exposure or
that they relied instead on 2 studies financed by the plastics lobby," said
Dr. Anila Jacob. ²This shows again how the industry works to influence
regulators to water down the health risks posed by BPA.²

findings can be found at <a href="http://www.ewg.org/node/26201" target="_new">http://www.ewg.org/node/26201</a>
