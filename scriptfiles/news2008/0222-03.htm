<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 22 - Today, Rep. Rick Renzi (R-AZ) was indicted on multiple federal charges. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has included Rep. Renzi in Beyond DeLay: The Most Corrupt Members of Congress report for the past three years. His profile can be read <a href="http://www.beyonddelay.org/node/94" target="_new">here</a>
<p></p>
Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of CREW made the following statement today:
<p></p>
“Rep. Renzi’s criminal conduct has been evident for years now. Thankfully, the Department of Justice is holding him accountable given that his House colleagues refused to do so. The House ethics committee – as always – ignored yet another member of Congress’s blatant abuse of his position. Bluster aside, this latest in a string of congressional indictments demonstrates that Congress simply will not police itself.”
