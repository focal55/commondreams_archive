<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 24 - “Today’s report by the National Research Council confirms what advocates for the environment, public health, and consumers have been saying for years: rushing to provide our nation’s water supply through ocean desalination is truly a risky venture.
<p>“Desalination shouldn’t be used as a quick fix to our water-shortage problems.&nbsp; Even the NRC report agrees that conservation is a much less expensive alternative.</p>
<p>“Our nation’s scientists set out to assess the potential of seawater and brackish water desalination to help meet the country’s anticipated water supply needs.&nbsp; The report concludes, however, that such an assessment is impossible given the lack of adequate study over a host of potential environmental, consumer, and public health problems.</p>
<p>“Desalination proponents envision a chain of expensive plants framing our coastlines and providing steady profits for investors.&nbsp; In this possible future, the costs are paid by water customers and the environment.</p>
<p>“Potential environmental impacts include the destruction of sealife, ecological impacts from disposing of salty brine, and increased global warming pollution from increased energy use, among others.&nbsp; In the end, the report provides a lengthy list of research needs before desalination is ever to be a viable option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Decision makers at the local, state, and national levels should remember this before they rush into funding or siting ocean desalination plants.&nbsp; Desalination facilities have the potential to create more problems than they solve.”<br><br>
