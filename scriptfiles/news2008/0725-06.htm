WASHINGTON - July 25 -   The <a href="http://www.freegaza.org">Free Gaza Movement</a> is organizing a boat of activists to enter Gaza by sea via Cyprus. Among the activists: <br>
<br>

<b><a href="mailto:hedy@hedyepstein.com">HEDY EPSTEIN</a></b><br>
Born in Germany, Epstein is a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust. She said today: "I wish Sen. Obama had talked about walls not only in Berlin, but also when he was in Israel, and then had really gone into the West Bank and/or Gaza and seen the devastation that the wall and siege of Gaza has created for Palestinians. I know whereof I speak, because I have been to the Israeli occupied West Bank five times since 2003. On or about Aug. 5, I will be joining approximately 40 peace-loving nonviolent people from all over the world on a boat from Cyprus to Gaza, to 'Break the Siege' of Gaza." She is author of <i>Remembering Is Not Enough: The Autobiography of Hedy Epstein</i>. <br>

Deeb, who was born and raised in Gaza, is a U.S. citizen who is living in Los Angeles. He will be leaving LA on Monday for Cyprus. Deeb said today: "The presidential candidates Obama and McCain have each gone to the Israeli town of Sderot, which has sustained moderate damage and causalities. Yet they both ignored the total devastating disaster -- as a result of the Israeli siege and bombing -- of the Gaza Strip and its 1.4 million Palestinians. With hundreds -- if not thousands -- of killed civilian victims, Israel claims to have left Gaza in 2005. If that is true, then it will not interfere with us going there by sea from international waters."<br>
