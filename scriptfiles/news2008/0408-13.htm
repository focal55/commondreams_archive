<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 8 -The IMF has announced a plan for a new income model for the Fund, which would involve sale of some of its gold holdings. Funds from gold sales will be invested, with proceeds used to support the IMF's operations.<br>
  <br>
  The U.S. Executive Director to the IMF cannot vote in favor of gold sales without prior approval from the U.S. Congress. Eighty U.S. civil society organizations have written to Congress, urging that "Congress insist on meaningful reforms in IMF policy in developing countries and attach conditions to how gold sales will occur."<br><br>Signers of the letter include: Action Aid International USA, the AFL-CIO, Africa Action, the Bank Information Center, Essential Action, 50 Years is Enough, Global AIDS Alliance, Health GAP, Jubilee USA Network, the ONE Campaign, Oxfam America, RESULTS USA, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the Student Global AIDS Campaign.<br><br>The letter identifies ways that IMF policies have prevented low-income countries from building up their public health systems, undermining global efforts to redress the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other critical health problems. In particular, the organizations highlight recent alarming findings by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office that as much as 74% of aid to sub-Saharan African countries between 1999-2005 has been diverted from its intended purposes and allocated to domestic debt payment and international currency reserves, because of IMF macroeconomic and monetary policies.<br><br>The letter explains that the IMF's "overly restrictive deficit-reduction and inflation-reduction targets" prevent "developing countries from growing their economies and expanding public spending, including in the critical areas of health and education." It also notes that IMF-imposed "budget and wage bill ceilings can undermine impoverished countries'<br>ability to provide adequate salaries for health and education workers, hire additional needed health workers and teachers and scale up and improve the quality of the health and education sectors."<br><br>Before approving gold sales, the letter urges, Congress should demand changes in harmful IMF policies. Specifically, the letter calls on Congress to ensure that:<br><br></p><ul><li>The IMF rescinds the use of overly restrictive deficit-reduction and inflation-reduction targets; </li><li>Expanded health and education spending in developing countries is exempt from IMF-imposed budget ceilings; </li><li>Developing countries be permitted to spend foreign aid for its intended purposes (currently, for countries not meeting IMF economic targets, the Fund requires additional aid to be diverted to currency reserves or to pay down debt); </li><li>Debt cancellation must be de-linked from harmful economic policy conditions; and </li><li>Transparency and the right to access information be strengthened at the IMF.</li></ul><p class="bodytext"><br>The letter also urges that "if gold sales are to be approved, a significant portion of the proceeds should therefore be devoted to the public good of alleviating global poverty."

  <br><strong><span class="important">Civil society experts available for interviews:</span></strong><br><strong>Joanne Carter, Associate Executive Director, RESULTS/RESULTS Educational Fund:</strong> "Facing the prospect of budget shortfalls, the IMF wants to sell part of its gold reserves to pay staff and administrative costs into the future. This same IMF imposes policies on impoverished countries that prevent them from hiring and paying the doctors and nurses and teachers they desperately need to deal with epidemics of tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other diseases and educate their children. Ending these policies should come before Congress allows any IMF gold sales." cell: (202) 320-8269<br><br><strong>Asia Russell, Director of International Policy, Health GAP:</strong> "For years the IMF has imposed disastrous conditions on poor countries that have contributed to massive underinvestment in health, HIV/AIDS and education, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Now the IMF wants permission to move forward with gold sales. The U.S. Congress has an obligation to impose conditions on the IMF, before gold sales are authorized, in order to help poor countries scale up spending for life saving health and education programs." cell: (267) 475-2645<br><br><strong>Neil Watkins, National Coordinator, Jubilee USA Network: </strong>"IMF gold is a global public good and should be used to fight global poverty, rather than as a blank check to fund an institution that needs serious reform.<br>IMF gold could help finance broader debt cancellation that impoverished countries need to address deadly poverty." cell: (202) 421-1023<br><br><strong>Robert Weissman, Director, Essential Action: </strong>"IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn properly says that the 'need for public intervention' to address the global financial crisis 'is becoming more evident.' Yet the IMF has for decades worked to prevent developing country governments from intervening in their economies to advance poverty-reduction and pro-health agendas. Instead, the Fund has demanded 'structural adjustment' -- a series of market fundamentalist, corporate-friendly policies, including hyper-restrictive macroeconomic policies. Now, with considerable irony, the IMF seeks to sell some of its gold stock to finance its own financial restructuring. The U.S.<br>Congress should not approve gold sales without attaching specific, measurable conditions of its own." Specifically, Congress should insist that -- before gold sales are approved -- the IMF abandon its structural adjustment program and rigid adherence to restrictive inflation-reduction and deficit reduction targets. It should obtain specific, iron-clad commitments that poor countries will be able to expand health and education spending without being subject to overall budget ceilings and deficit targets. The Congress should not let this opportunity pass without ensuring that the IMF will not interfere with poor countries' and donor efforts to invest in health and poverty reduction." cell: (202) 360-1844<br><br><strong>Sameer Dossani, Director, 50 Years Is Enough: U.S. Network for Global Economic Justice:</strong> "After many years of forcing adjustment on developing countries, the IMF is going through its own budget austerity measures.<br>Sales of IMF assets including gold should be used to cancel the debts of developing countries who have already paid more than their share, and the current restructuring of the IMF should also include an end to IMF policy conditions, including those that limit spending on health care and education." cell: +32 48 805-3064 (In Brussels until April 10)/U.S.:<br>(202) 340-0216</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
