<p>DALLAS, TEXAS - February 6 - Widespread voting problems were discovered at polls in Georgia according to calls into <b>1-866-MYVOTE1</b>, an election protection and voter information hotline promoted by the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show and sponsored by the NAACP National Voter Fund.
<p></p>
So far today, the hotline has received in excess of 5,000 calls. Roughly 1,000 of those callers cited voter infractions concentrated in the 13th congressional district in Georgia that includes parts of Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton and Henry counties.
<p></p>
The majority of callers expressed long lines and delays in voting due to insufficient voting machines and problems associated with the enforcement of Georgia’s new controversial voter ID law.
<p></p>
Similar problems were also found in parts of Georgia’s 4th, 5th and 11th congressional districts.
<p></p>
“The problems faced in Georgia by thousands of voters were tied directly to the larger than expected influx of voters during the primary, and the failure of many county election officials to plan for the large influx of new voters.” according to Greg Moore, Executive Director of the NAACP National Voter Fund.
<p></p>
“This is looking more and more like a carbon copy of what went wrong in Ohio in 2004.” said Moore. “Georgia lacks any statewide standard for machine to voter ratio that can help mitigate long lines and unnecessary delays. Add to it the problems with the initial enforcement of the controversial mandatory voter ID law and you have a prescription for disaster.”
<p></p>
The Tom Joyner Morning Show urged voters throughout the day to stay in line and to report any problems they are encountering to the MYVOTE1 hotline number throughout the day.<!-- #EndEditable -->
