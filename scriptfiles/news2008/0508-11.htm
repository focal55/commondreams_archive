<P></P>
With the prospect of a U.S. military strike on Iran <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3868063.ece" target="_new">looming</a>, America's third largest city will decide next week whether to take a stand on this volatile international situation.
<P></P>
At the Chicago City Council meeting on Wednesday, May 14 at 10:00 AM in the City Council chambers, the body will vote on a <a href="http://www.nowaroniran-chicago.org/resolution.htm" target="_new">resolution</a> introduced by <a href="http://www.ward49.com/" target="_new">Alderman Joe Moore</a> (with the support of Chicago's <a href="http://www.nowaroniran-chicago.org/" target="_new">No War on Iran Coalition</a>) that would declare the city opposed to a U.S. military attack on Iran.
<P></P>
Hearings on the resolution will be held the day before — Tuesday, May 13 at 11:30 AM in Room 201-A of City Hall. Testifying will be:

All of the experts but Professor Cassel will be on hand at a press conference one hour before the hearings, at 10:30 AM in the Council lobby, second floor, City Hall (just outside the elevators).
<P></P>
While a <a href="http://citiesforprogress.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=242" target="_new">handful </a>of American cities have passed similar resolutions, Chicago would be by far the largest to do so. "With the economy in a freefall," said Alderman Moore, the resolution's author, "another unnecessary military adventure would sap even more of the resources critically needed to improve the quality of life in Chicago's neighborhoods."
<P></P>
"No one harbors any illusions that the resolution will stop a U.S. attack on Iran," said Michael Lynn of Chicago's No War on Iran Coalition. The measure is rather "a vehicle to raise the profile of the issue — right in the country's heartland — and demonstrate broad opposition to a wider war."
<P></P>
The goal, said Lynn, is "to influence policy by showing there would be serious political consequences to any attack." The resolution's passage, he said, "could inspire people in other cities to press their local governments to pass similar measures."
<P></P>
The resolution's co-sponsors include 2nd Ward Alderman Robert Fioretti; 4th Ward Alderman Toni Preckwinkle; 6th Ward Alderman Freddrenna Lyle; 7th Ward Alderman Sandi Jackson; 22nd Ward Alderman Ricardo Muñoz; 47th Ward Alderman Eugene Schulter; and 48th Ward Alderman Mary Ann Smith.
<P></P>
As well, a range of political scientists at the major universities in Chicago — from Northwestern and the University of Chicago to DePaul and the University of Illinois at Chicago — and other prominent local commentators have expressed their <a href="http://www.nowaroniran-chicago.org/support.htm" target="_new">support</a> for the resolution.
