MADRID - August 19 - The international humanitarian aid organization Action Against Hunger / Action Contre la Faim (ACF) has been working in Georgia since 1995, and in the coming weeks, both permanent and emergency teams will assist the nearly 13,000 displaced people who have arrived in Kutaisi, the second largest city in the country.
<p></p>
Days after the outbreak of conflict in South Ossetia, thousands of people are still staying in makeshift shelters in several Georgian cities. In Kutaisi, the next largest city after Tbilisi, Action Against Hunger estimates that the 13,000 displaced people are Georgians who have arrived in this city west of their country from South Ossetia, Abkhazia and the neighboring Gori. Housed in 17 collective centers, sports centers, shelters and schools, families are totally dependent on external aid for drinking water and food.
<p></p>
The Action Against Hunger teams in Georgia have visited the reception centers in Tbilisi and Kutaisi and have performed an analysis of the food situation of the population. "There are at least 11 centers that require urgent assistance in Kutaisi and we found that the host sites do not have the capacity to serve the entire population," says Shahnoza Muniova, head of mission for Action Against Hunger in Caucasus. According to a follow-up investigation in the region, in just one month the price of food such as rice has doubled, and bread, flour and other commodities have also seen strong increases.
<p></p>
In the coming weeks, ACF will launch an emergency intervention to provide drinking water and food to approximately 8,000 people in Kutaisi and also carry out a second intervention with a more detailed assessment of the situation in several centers in Tbilisi.
<p></p>
"The main problem lies in identifying the newly displaced. The lengthy conflict between Georgia and the secessionist republics has led to thousands of internally displaced people who are now joined by the nearly 13,000 who have arrived in recent days "explains Vincent Stehli, desk officer for the Caucasus.
<p></p>
Action Against Hunger has worked in the Caucasus since 1995, implementing projects in water and sanitation, nutrition, and food security, benefiting nearly 60,000 people. The organization is the sole NGO in this area, specifically in Zugdidi and Abkhazia, and has launched micro enterprises, projects and initiatives between warring communities to support farmers affected by the conflict.
