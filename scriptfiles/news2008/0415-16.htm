<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 15 -  In a <a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/biochem/articles/fy09_biodefense_funding/" target="_new">new analysis</a> released today, the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation reported that the U.S. government has spent or allocated over $48 billion to address the threat of biological weapons since September 2001. For fiscal year (FY) 2009, the Bush administration is proposing an additional $9 billion in bioweapons-related spending, approximately $2.5 billion (or 4%) more than the amount Congress appropriated in FY2008. The majority of the increase represents the release of the final $2.175 billion approved by Congress in 2004 for advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures to biological weapons agents under Project BioShield. Excluding Project BioShield, the FY2009 budget request still grows by 5.3% over FY2008 appropriated funding. If the FY2009 request is fully funded, total bioweapons-related funding since FY2001 will exceed $57 billion.</p>

<p>Funding continues to focus primarily on research, development, acquisition, and stockpiling of medical countermeasures and protective equipment, with over $23 billion devoted to these functions through FY2009. Improving state, local, and hospital preparedness totals over $10 billion, and medical surveillance and environmental detection of biological weapons agents totals over $4.1 billion, through FY2009. $1.13 billion (or 2%) of all federal bioweapons-related funding through FY2009 is dedicated to prevent the development, acquisition, and use of biological weapons by states and non-state terrorists. Funding for prevention has increased significantly in the last year, accounting for 3.4% of total bioweapons-related funding for FY2009, a level not seen since 2001.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/about/staff/apearson/" target="_new">Dr. Alan Pearson</a>, Director of the Biological and Chemical Weapons Program at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, explained that "<strong><em>Prevention is inherently less expensive than preparedness and response, but it is a critical component of the comprehensive approach needed to protect our nation from biological attacks. The recent increase in attention to prevention activities, in terms of both policy and funding, is a positive development. Further strengthening of cooperative international action against the development and use of biological weapons will be essential for improving our nation's security</em></strong>."</p>

<p>"<strong><em>With nearly $50 billion already appropriated since 2001, it's time to begin asking whether the money is being well spent. In some cases, such as spending for prevention and for strengthening the public health infrastructure, the answer appears to be yes. But in others, the answer may be no. A lot of money is being devoted to research and development, and to environmental detection, but it is not clear that the returns have been as great as promised</em></strong>," Dr. Pearson concluded.</p>
