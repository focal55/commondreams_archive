May 28 - Thousands of people gathered in downtown DC for the annual Memorial Day parade on Monday. American flags lined the street and viewers showed their support for US troops and their patriotism.
<p></p>
Instead of a flag, Michael Marceau held a banner, which called for peace, and stated that his veterans' organization had been "kicked out of the parade." He says all their group wanted to do "was be visible and be acknowledged as someone who has stepped up to serve their country when their country asked them to."
<p></p>
Some parade attendees say the group had the right to be there on grounds of free speech, while others say that while troops are the ones who gave the country the freedom to disagree with the government, the group didn't belong in the Memorial Day commemoration because "it's not a political parade."
