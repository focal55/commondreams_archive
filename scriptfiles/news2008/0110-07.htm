<p>WORLDWIDE - January 10 -       Amnesty International is leading worldwide events, rallies and meetings to mark the sixth anniversary of the first transfers of detainees to Guantánamo Bay. People around the world will be taking action to seek the immediate closure of the detention centre and an end to all illegal detentions. <br>
<br>
Amnesty International events for the anniversary will showcase the recently declassified “Poems from Guantánamo” in countries including Bahrain, Luxembourg, Denmark and Spain. Amnesty International's Bahrain section described its poetry reading as “another step forward in our struggle to let the voices of the detainees reach the world... We hope that this anniversary is the last one and that Guantánamo Bay is closed forever.” <br>
<br>
Over 1,200 parliamentary representatives from many countries around the world have signed a declaration calling to end illegal detention by the US government carried out in the name of counter-terrorism. Hundreds signed from parliaments across continental Europe, the UK, and Israel – countries that are the staunchest US allies in the “war on terror”. <br>
<em><br>
Other key events include: </em><br>
<strong>
UK: </strong>In London, there will be an all-night vigil around a replica
Guantánamo cage, filled every hour with a new ‘captive’. The morning
after will see a mass demonstration in front of the US embassy in
London. Hundreds of protestors in orange jumpsuits will sit in stress
positions under the eyes of faux US guards. Rallies will also be held
at the US Consulate in Edinburgh and through the streets of Belfast.<br>

<strong>USA: </strong>In Washington DC, Amnesty International members and other activists will gather on the National Mall dressed in orange jumpsuits to urge Congress and the Bush administration to shut down Guantánamo.
