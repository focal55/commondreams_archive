<p>WASHINGTON - January 14 -As fears of a flu pandemic have grown, the Bush 
administration has pursued a misguided approach to pandemic preparation that 
relies on a law enforcement/national security approach, rather than a public 
health approach to the problem, and which exposes Americans to unnecessary 
risk.&nbsp; That is the finding of an 
expert report being released today by the American Civil Liberties Union at the 
National Press Club in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Washington</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">DC</st1:state></st1:place>. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: black;">“A law enforcement approach is 
just the wrong tool for the job when it comes to fighting disease,” said Barry 
Steinhardt, director of the ACLU’s Technology and Liberty Program.&nbsp; “History makes clear that a 
heavy-handed, coercive approach to pandemics that treats the sick as potential 
enemies is not only an unnecessary violation of civil liberties but is also 
ineffective from a public health standpoint and will leave more Americans 
stranded, sick and untreated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">The report was </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">prepared for the ACLU by three prominent 
experts on the subject: George Annas and Wendy K. Mariner of Boston University 
School of Public Health, and Wendy E. Parmet of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Northeastern</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">Law</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">School</st1:placetype></st1:place>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">“When people are sick, they want 
<i>help</i> – help getting treated and help 
ensuring they don’t make others sick,” said Parmet.&nbsp; “History shows that treating sick people 
like potential enemies only spurs them to avoid the authorities and exacerbates 
the spread of disease.”&nbsp; 

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">The report was being released 
today in a press conference at the National Press Club in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Washington</st1:city> <st1:state w:st="on">DC</st1:state></st1:place>, followed by a panel discussion with 
several top experts. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;">“It is true that there are always 
a few cases where individuals flout the law and put other people at risk,” said 
Parmet.&nbsp; “But existing government 
authorities provide ample powers for dealing with such cases – and the problem 
is that our pandemic preparations are being centered around such contingencies, 
rather than from the long list of gaping needs that public health experts say we 
face in preparing for and responding to a real pandemic.”&nbsp; </span></p>

<p align="center"><span style="color: black;">Video of an ACLU-hosted panel 
discussion featuring Parmet and other experts discussing pandemic preparedness 
will be made available online at <a href="http://www.aclu.org/future" target="_new">www.aclu.org/future</a>.
