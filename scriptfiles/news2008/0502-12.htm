<p>CALIFORNIA - May 2 - New Report from Institute for Food and Development Policy Warns of
Widespread Genetic Contamination, Corporate Domination of Agriculture
through "<a href="http://www.foodfirst.org/en/node/2111" target="_new">Agro-fuels Trojan Horse</a>"
<P></P>
A new report from the Institute for Food and Development Policy examines a
little looked at side of the biofuels debate: Will agriculturally-derived
fuels (agro-fuels) be genetically engineered? The report answers a
resounding "Yes!" Entitled "The Agro-fuels Trojan Horse: Biotechnology and
the Corporate Domination of Agriculture," the new report finds that by
accepting an energy future based on agro-fuels, the world is bringing
genetic engineering into our food system through the back door.
<P></P>
The report describes our situation as a "precipice," citing an impressive,
if not frightening biotechnology pipeline for fuel crops: from the genes
of deep sea thermal vent bacteria in corn, to traits that make food plants
like sugarcane and sorghum produce biomass instead of food. The author
explains how special genetically engineered fuel traits are poised to take
over the ag sector as the ethanol market continues to boom. "The
biotechnology industry is hoping that consumers will be more likely to buy
genetically modified products if they are destined for their gas tanks,
instead of the dinner table," says the report's author Annie Shattuck of
Food First.
<P></P>
However, the trouble with this logic is that there is no guarantee GM fuel
traits will not contaminate their food-producing cousins. In fact,
widespread genetic contamination is almost certain. Many of the new
species being modified as fuel crops are wild. Some have pollen that can
travel up to 1200 miles.  The report's author sees the genetic
modification of agro-fuels as a "Trojan Horse," a way to circumvent public
debate and sound science by basking in the "sunny glow of alternative
fuels."
<P></P>
The report examines the history of the biotechnology industry, concluding
that until now, its lack of public credibility has kept it from expanding
beyond a few industrial commodity crops.  Previous biotechnology offerings
spurred incredible consolidation in the agricultural industry. Three major
biotech companies now control 40% of the global seed market. The report
warns that agro-fuels will give a few corporations monopoly power over
both our food and fuel systems.
<P></P>
In the current climate of a dual food and fuel crisis, this new report
calls for a moratorium on agro-fuels and local solutions that respect
biodiversity, the autonomy of small farmers, and food sovereignty.
