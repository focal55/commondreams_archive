WASHINGTON - August 13 - Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) will bring its national tour of a life-size Guantanamo prison cell replica to Denver, Colorado starting Sunday, August 24 through Tuesday, August 26; visitors are encouraged to experience the cell and push the Bush administration to shut down Guantanamo.
<p></p>
AIUSA’s executive director Larry Cox will hold a media availability to discuss the organization’s human rights concerns about Guantanamo on Monday, August 25, from 11 a.m. to noon in front of the cell replica. Visitors may tour the cell and record a 30-second reaction video that will be posted on youtube.com and AIUSA’s tearitdown.org, as well as sign the global petition to shut Guantanamo down. On the outside of the cell are large LCD screens showing a timeline of illegal U.S. detentions and torture, as well as related facts and quotes.
<p></p>
The cell is a replica of a Camp 5 cell. It brings to life the harsh realities of illegal detention to concerned citizens and highlights the human rights violations that Guantanamo symbolizes. The cell includes a steel toilet, florescent lights and a sliding metal door. Detainees reported being held in isolation in similar cells for as long as 23 hours.
<p></p>
Previous stops along AIUSA’s national cell replica tour include Miami, Philadelphia, Portland, ME and Washington, DC. The cell replica will also visit St. Paul/Minneapolis and Los Angeles.
