TLAXIACO, OAXACA - June 8 - Representatives of the community of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan hosted a working meeting with the governor, Ulises Ruiz Ortiz, and a group of his colleagues, in the offices of Centro De Derechos Humanos Y Asesoria A Pueblos Indigenas (Center for Human Rights and Advice for Indigenous Peoples) in order to create an agreement with the federal and state authorities as to the implementation of the 'precautionary measures' requested by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for 60 members of the community of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan. 
<br>
<br>
Gustavo Castanada Hernandez, Melesio Martinez Robles, and Inocencio Medina Bernabe were assassinated on April 30th in Santo Domingo Ixcatlan because they opposed the sale of communal land.  The former president of the municipality, Freddy Eucario Morales Arias, and the paramilitary forces he commands, are accused of the crime.  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights requested 'precautionary measures' for 60 people who are relatives of the victims and witnesses of the assassination.  The 'precautionary measures' require the Mexican government to protect the lives and physical integrity of the 60 beneficiaries.  
<br>
<br>
  During the working meeting, the families of the victims asked the governor for justice, and specifically for the detention of the intellectual and substantive authors of the massacre.  The families emphasized that the whole community grieved the loss of the three men.  Leaders of the community and former presidents of the municipality also demanded justice, remembered the dead, and described their intense fear about the future of the community.
<br>

<br>
Maurilio Santiago Reyes, the President of the Center for Human Rights and Counsel for Indigenous People, commented that, contrary to the governor's statements "This is bigger than an agrarian conflict.  This is a political conflict between the paramilitaries that the governor himself has protected and support and the people of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan."
<br>
<br>
Afterwards, the Solicitor General of Justice of the State, Evencio Nicolas Ramirez Martinez, maintained that the courts would continue the investigation of the accused, Freddy Eucario Morales Arias.  The Regional Sub-solicitor of Justice will seek to apprehend the others accused of the crime.
<br>
<br>
The parties agreed to a draft agreement which requires the state to remove the 'State Preventive Police' because the police are accused of protecting those accused of the triple homicide.  The Secretary of Citizen Protection promised to investigate the complicity of the state police in the three homicides.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, the Sub-Secretary of Human Rights of the State Government, Rosario Villalobos, promised to send a team of medical and psychological professionals to the community to assist the 60 beneficiaries of the 'precautionary measures.'
<br>
<br>
Finally, the government promised to provide emergency food kits for the 60 beneficiaries of the 'precautionary measures' because food resources had been exhausted during the past month of insecurity.  The ongoing security of the community remains the responsibility of the State Investigation Agency.
<br>
<br>
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights requested that the government of Mexico guarantee the safety and physical integrity of 60 individuals in accord with a report released by the President of CEDHAPI, Maurilio Santiago Reyes.<!-- #EndEditable -->
