NEW YORK - May 20 - Amid rising concern over toxic chemicals in consumer products
and the bodies of Americans, three members of Congress today introduced
legislation to make sure chemicals are safe before they are allowed on the
market.
<p></p>
Under current law known as the Toxic Substances Control Act, unchanged since
1976, most new chemicals are approved with little or no safety testing, and
more than 62,000 existing chemicals have remained on the market for three
decades despite evidence that some pose serious health risks. The Kid Safe
Chemicals Act, by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Reps. Hilda Solis and
Henry Waxman, both California Democrats, would place the burden of proof on
the chemical industry to show that chemicals are safe for children before
they are added to consumer products.
<p></p>
"When babies come into this world pre-polluted with hundreds of dangerous
industrial chemicals already in their blood, it's clear that the regulatory
system is broken," said Ken Cook, president of Environmental Working Group
(EWG). "The Kid Safe Chemicals Act will change a lax, outdated system that
presumes chemicals are safe into one that requires makers of toxic chemicals
to prove their safety before they¹re allowed on the market."
<p></p>
"This bill is a long-overdue move to put public health ahead of chemical
industry profits," Cook added. "We thank Sen. Lautenberg and Rep. Solis and
Chairman Waxman for their leadership."
<p></p>
A coalition of grassroots, state and national organizations led by EWG sent
a letter to the lawmakers today applauding their action and pledging support
as the work begins to make this legislation law. <a href="http://www.ewg.org/files/KSCALetterSignatures.pdf" target="_new">The letter and a list of
