<p>WASHINGTON, DC  - February 27 -  The League of Women Voters today raised concerns about the latest proposal to reform the ethics process, which is expected to go before the House this week. 
<P></P>
“This proposal does not provide the independent ethics enforcement process that the House needs to properly protect the public interest,” said Mary G. Wilson, national president of the League of Women Voters. 
<P></P>
“The investigative powers of the proposed new Office of Congressional Ethics are simply insufficient,” Wilson stated.  “The proposal fails to provide the new office with access to subpoena power, ensuring that it cannot compel cooperation from outside entities and individuals, congressional staff and Members,” she said.
<P></P>
“Voters in 2006 clearly reacted to the ‘business as usual’ approach that Congress took to the scandals that plagued the House.  Voters continue to have high expectations for ethics reform.  They want changes that will be strong and effective,” Wilson said.  “This proposal falls short,” she said. 
<P></P>
“This proposal will prove to be inadequate and will have to be revisited, probably when the next wave of public scandals arrives,” Wilson continued.
<P></P>
“The League is deeply disappointed that this proposal is the best the House is willing, or able, to achieve,” Wilson concluded.
