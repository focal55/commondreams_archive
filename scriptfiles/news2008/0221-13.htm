<p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - February 21 -  Today the Brennan Center for Justice, along with the MacArthur Center
for Justice, filed a brief with the Supreme Court seeking judicial review and a
writ of habeas corpus for two U.S.
citizens detained in Iraq and
held by U.S.
personnel for the past two to three years.&nbsp;
The combined cases, <em><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/omar_v_harvey/" target="_new">Munaf v.
Geren and Geren v. Omar</a></em>, present
a stark constitutional question: do Americans seized and held abroad have the
same fundamental rights as other U.S. citizens?
</p>
<p>
The cases will be heard on March 25 and the Supreme Court
will decide two issues:&nbsp; First, whether
military officials have the power to seize and detain a U.S. citizen,
without judicial review, based on their claim that they are "agents" of a
multinational entity.&nbsp; And second, do
those officials then have free rein to hand over an American to another
government likely to torture and kill him.

</p>
<p>
"The government here is asking for a free pass to infringe
the core liberties of U.S.
citizens," said Aziz Huq, director <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/section/category/liberty_national_security/" target="_new">of
the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security project</a>.&nbsp; "But there is no loophole to fundamental
freedoms simply because the government claims to act in concert with other
countries."&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Shawqi Omar is an American citizen who was arrested by U.S. forces in Iraq
in 2004, transferred between U.S.
bases in the Middle East and tortured.&nbsp;
The government argued that because the Iraq
war was under the banner of the United Nations, U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction
to rule on the case.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Mohammad Munaf is being held by U.S.
forces in Iraq
and was tried and convicted by an Iraqi court for his alleged role in a
kidnap-for-hire case.&nbsp; Munaf will be executed if U.S. forces turn him over to the
Iraqi government.&nbsp; The U.S.
government contends U.S.
courts do not have jurisdiction in this matter.

</p>
<p>
They have both been labeled as "security internees," a term
that remains vague and not clearly defined. 
</p>
<p>
The Brennan
Center filed habeas
corpus petitions for Messrs. Omar and Munaf in 2005 and 2006 respectively.&nbsp; Until January 2008, the month after the
Supreme Court decided to hear the case, Omar and Munaf were denied access to
their American counsel.&nbsp; And the
government still argues that the cases should be dismissed.
</p>
<p>
"The government's position threatens to undo long
established precedent protecting American citizens from the arbitrary and
lawless exercise of executive power," said Brennan Center
attorney Jonathan Hafetz.&nbsp; "The
fundamental rights of Americans must be upheld no matter where they are."
</p>
<p>

The cases come on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2004 decision
in <em>Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>, which reaffirmed
that U.S. citizens seized by
the U.S.
military overseas may challenge their detention in federal court.&nbsp; Omar and Munaf ask only for the chance to
present that challenge.&nbsp; By denying them
this chance, the government is trying to roll back the <em>Hamdi</em> judgment of just four years ago.<!-- #EndEditable -->
