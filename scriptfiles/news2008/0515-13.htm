WASHINGTON, DC - May 15 - Congress created a new conservation program today that’s aimed at helping local communities protect prized forests for recreational purposes. The Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program, which provides federal matching grants to local governments and qualified non-profit organizations across the country to acquire forests and open spaces for local ownership and management, now heads to the White House for consideration.
 <P></P>
 

“At a time when open space is dwindling under the pressure of development, this program gives people the ability to protect land and water that’s important to them in their communities,” said Michael Francis, the director of the national forest program for The Wilderness Society – one of the many conservation organizations that backed the program. Francis added that more than 40 million acres are expected to be converted from forestlands to developments by 2030.

  <P></P>

The Senate passed the bill today as part of the farm bill package by a vote of 81-15. The House passed it yesterday by a 318-106 vote. Sen. Patrick Leahy wrote the bill and saw it through to fruition with a range of congressional leaders including the chairmen of the Senate and House agricultural committees – Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.).

 
 <P></P>
“The new Community Forest program will enable communities across the country to protect their outdoor heritage,” said Alan Front, senior vice president for The Trust for Public Land.  “Critical forest lands that are important to the fabric of our communities’ culture, economy, environment and overall way of life are in need of protection. We applaud Congress for recognizing the need for a program that will provide another tool to help communities meet their local recreation, economic and conservation needs." 

 
 <P></P>
The Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program will give communities grants to help purchase key forest lands that provide “right out the back door” public access and other community benefits.  These community forests will be true public assets that provide endless dividends, ranging from clean water supplies and timber harvest revenues that feed local budgets to community activities like hunting and fishing and recreation and education programs aimed at reducing the nature deficit in today’s younger generation.
