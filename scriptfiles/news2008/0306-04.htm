<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 6 - <p>Americans United for Separation of Church and State today asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate a Houston church whose pastor issued a letter of endorsement for a congressional candidate.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.au.org/site/DocServer/Grace_community_church_pdf.pdf?docID=2501" target="_new">letter to IRS</a> officials, Americans United says that Steve Riggle, pastor of Grace Community Church, may have violated federal tax law by endorsing U.S. House of Representatives candidate Shelley Sekula Gibbs.</p>

<p>“Clergy may endorse candidates as private citizens,” said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. “That’s not what happened here. <a href="http://www.au.org/site/DocServer/Grace_Community_Church_letter.pdf?docID=2481" target="_new">Riggle’s endorsement letter</a> twice identifies him as senior pastor of Grace Community Church, conveying the clear message that the church supports Gibbs’ campaign.” </p>
<p>Riggle’s letter of endorsement was widely distributed by the campaign and carries the line, “Paid by and authorized by the Shelley Sekula Gibbs for Congress Campaign Committee.”</p>
<p>In the letter, Riggle calls on people to vote for Gibbs, writing, “I have pastored in the 22nd District for 24 years. It is not often I endorse a candidate for office. I want to know if they represent my values. I have thoroughly discussed the issues of life, marriage and family with Shelley over the years…. <strong>I’m convinced that Shelley has the experience, knowledge and values that fully prepare her to meet the challenges we confront in Washington, D.C.</strong>”</p>
<p>In a letter to the IRS, Americans United Executive Director Barry W. Lynn wrote, “Nowhere in the letter does Riggle state that he is speaking as a private citizen. The letterhead twice identifies him as senior pastor of Grace Community Church. No attempt is made to distance the church from this endorsement. Although the IRS permits pastors to endorse candidates as private citizens, it cautions that pastors must not do so in their official capacity as congregational leaders.” </p>
