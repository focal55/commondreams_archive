NEW YORK - July 7 - The New York-based Campaign for Peace and Democracy sent an open letter today to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice protesting the proposed U.S. radar military base in the Czech Republic. Ms. Rice is scheduled to arrive in Prague this week to sign a treaty providing for the base, though the treaty will not be finalized until the Czech parliament ratifies it. More than two thirds of the Czech population opposes the radar, and the parliament is evenly divided on the issue.
<P></P>
 For more details, see the text of the open letter below. It was signed by 85 individuals, including Norman Birnbaum, Noam Chomsky, Ariel Dorfman, Bruce Gagnon, Thomas Harrison, Joanne Landy, Jesse Lemisch, Scott McLemee, Jennifer Scarlott, Stephen Shalom, Mary Beth Sullivan, Meredith Tax, Cornel West, and Howard Zinn. The full list of signatories is at the end of the letter.

OPEN LETTER TO CONDOLEEZZA RICE
ON THE OCCASION OF HER JULY TRIP TO PRAGUE:
PROTEST AGAINST U.S. RADAR IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC
<P></P>
To Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice,
<P></P>
On July 8, you are scheduled to go to Prague to sign a treaty establishing a U.S. military radar base in the Czech Republic. We want you, the Czech people and people around the world to know that we condemn this treaty as a grave threat to world peace that heightens international tensions and increases the danger of nuclear weapons being used. 
<P></P>
The proposed radar base is part of an increasingly aggressive policy toward Russia; we strongly oppose this new Cold War. Furthermore, the base has been consistently rejected by a large majority of the Czech people. We call on the Czech government to respect the will of its people and to withdraw its support for the treaty.
<P></P>
Your administration claims that the radar base, along with related interceptor missiles to be placed in Poland, is meant to intercept missiles from “rogue states,” principally Iran. It is clear, however, that the system has more to do with Washington’s growing rivalry with Moscow. In fact, it is the first part of a more advanced “Star Wars” missile defense aimed at blunting Russia’s nuclear force and allowing the United States to attack Russia  and other countries without fear of retaliation.
<P></P>
The Czech radar's job will be to tie into other U.S. war-fighting satellites, thus giving the U.S. seamless coverage of that region of the world. As the U.S. fills in deployments of Missile Defense interceptors and other similar technologies it then develops the ability to launch a first-strike attack against Russia, all coordinated from space. This first-strike is augmented by the ability, thanks to the Czech radar and nearby interceptor systems, to pick off any retaliatory strike by Russia.
<P></P>
Predictably, in a further  and unacceptable -- act of Cold War escalation, Moscow has threatened to direct missiles toward Europe if the United States proceeds with the system, thus putting the people of Poland and the Czech Republic, along with millions of others, on the front line in future conflicts between Russia and the U.S. Russia has also said it will suspend participation in a separate treaty limiting the deployment of conventional forces in Europe.
<P></P>
As for Iran, there is no credible evidence that a nuclear threat exists today. And the administration’s bellicose stance, far from guarding against such a threat in the future, only enhances the likelihood that Teheran will eventually try to acquire nuclear weapons. We believe that the U.S. can best prevent nuclear proliferation to Iran and other countries by making major reductions in its own nuclear and conventional forces and by renouncing imperial interventionism -- not by expanding the nuclear threat with “Star Wars” and other aggressive programs. This would create a political climate that would powerfully discourage new countries from developing their own nuclear weapons. The U.S. could make an immediate and vital contribution to world peace by getting out of Iraq now.
<P></P>
We are encouraged by polls that show 70 percent of the Czech population opposing the base and we are inspired by the emergence of active resistance -- recently strengthened by the three-week hunger strike of two Czech peace activists, Jan Tamas and Jan Bednar. Tamas and Bednar were followed by a chain hunger strike in the Czech Republic and many other countries. On June 22 thousands of people around the world renounced food for one day. Awareness is also growing within the European Parliament that the treaty, which was initiated bilaterally between the U.S.s and the Czech Republic, in fact affects all of Europe.
<P></P>
The Czech people have a long and heroic record of resistance to superpower domination: Prague Spring, Charter 77, the Velvet Revolution. The new Czech peace movement represents a revival of that tradition. We stand in solidarity with our Czech sisters and brothers. Like them, we choose life. Linking arms across borders, we will do everything we can to defeat the radar base treaty because it promises only danger and death.

THE CAMPAIGN FOR PEACE AND DEMOCRACY advocates a new, progressive and non-militaristic U.S. foreign policy -- one that encourages democratization, justice and social change. Founded in 1982, the Campaign opposed the Cold War by promoting "detente from below." It engaged Western peace activists in the defense of the rights of democratic dissidents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and enlisted East-bloc human rights activists against anti-democratic U.S. policies in countries like Nicaragua and Chile.<!-- #EndEditable -->
