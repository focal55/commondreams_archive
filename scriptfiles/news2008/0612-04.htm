 WASHINGTON, DC - June 12 - Following the Supreme Court’s ruling in Boumediene v. Bush, People For the American Way President Kathryn Kolbert released the following statement:
<P></P>
<ul>
    The Supreme Court has rebuked President Bush’s vision of the presidency as an office of limitless power, and declared that the president of a free nation cannot simply lock people up and throw away the key like some third-world dictator. This is a stinging blow to the administration’s lawless policies and its allies in Congress.
<P></P>
    It’s chilling that the case was decided on a single vote, 5-4. One more Bush Justice on the Court, and the decision would likely have gone the other way. That’s why it’s so important for Americans to realize that in this election year, the Supreme Court is on the ballot. John McCain has already promised the GOP that he would nominate Justices to the Court exactly like those Bush has brought to the bench. This year, we must reverse the tide, and begin to restore a Supreme Court that upholds our individual rights and the laws that keep us free.”
    </ul>
    Kolbert noted that People For the American Way’s sister organization, the People For the American Way Foundation, filed an amicus brief in the case.
