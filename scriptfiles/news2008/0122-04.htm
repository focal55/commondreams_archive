<p>WASHINGTON - January 22 -The Army failed to meet its 90 percent benchmark for new recruits having at least a regular high school diploma by nearly 20 percentage points, with a rate of 70.7 percent in 2007, according to a  county and state-level report on 2007 military recruits released today by the National Priorities Project (NPP), a non-profit research group releasing its fourth annual analysis of military recruits.  
<P></P>
NPP based this analysis on military recruitment data obtained from the Department of Defense through a Freedom of Information Act request.
<P></P>
Since 2005, the percentage of recruits with at least a high school diploma dropped almost 12 percentage points in two years, according to NPP.  Department of Defense (DoD) studies have shown that a high school diploma is a powerful indicator for recruits' success, with around 80 percent of those with regular high school diplomas finishing the first term of enlistment compared to only half of those without a diploma.  
<P></P>
At the same time, the percentage of 'high quality' recruits continued their downward trend, dropping 12 percentage points since 2004, from 60.9 percent in 2004 to 44.6 percent in 2007.  The DoD defines 'high quality' to include recruits who have at least a regular high school diploma and have scored in the upper half of the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT).  
<P></P>
"The Army's increased failure to meet its own benchmarks really speaks to the much larger failure of the Iraq War," said Greg Speeter, executive director of the National Priorities Project.  "Young people are naturally thinking twice before signing up to fight an unnecessary war with no end in sight," Speeter continued.
<P></P>
National Priorities Project's analysis also found that in 2007, upper-middle and high-income neighborhoods, or those with median household incomes of $60,000 and greater, were under-represented by an even larger margin than in 2004.  Meanwhile, the percentage of recruits from low and middle-income neighborhoods ($30,000 to $54,999) grew since 2004. Click here for income breakdowns by neighborhood.
<P></P>
"Once again, we're staring at the painful story of young people with fewer options bearing the greatest burden," Speeter noted.   "Instead of spending millions more on new enlistment bonuses, we need to change the terms of  where these soldiers are fighting and why they're taking the risk of never coming home."
<P></P>
 County, city and state-level findings include:
<P></P><ul>
    <br><li>Harris County, TX, Maricopa County, AZ and Los Angeles County, CA had the highest absolute number of recruits.
    <br><li>Edwards County, TX, Dixie County, FL, Galax city, VA and Turner County, GA had the highest recruitment rates, all over 10 per 1,000 youth.
    <br><li>Alabama, Montana and Maine had the highest recruiting rates for the states. 
    <br><li>Nevada, Montana and Mississippi had the lowest percentages of recruits with a regular high school diploma or better.
    <br><li>Mississippi, Louisiana and Nevada had the lowest percentages of 'high quality' recruits.
    <br><li>States with higher recruiting rates correlated with lower percentages of 'high quality' recruits.
