<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 - Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder released the following statement in response to John Edwards’ withdrawal from the presidential race:

 
<P></P>
“John Edwards is a true friend of the earth.  Through this campaign, he staked out bold positions on environmental issues and pushed other candidates to do better. John Edwards was the first candidate with a plan to cut global warming pollution 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050—a position subsequently embraced by Senators Clinton and Obama.  Edwards was also the sole top-tier candidate to oppose new nuclear power plants.  His plan to reduce the influence of corporate special interests would have yielded tremendous benefits for the planet.  He was also the first candidate to criticize the Senate’s Lieberman-Warner global warming bill, calling attention to the bill’s polluter giveaways worth up to a trillion dollars.  Friends of the Earth Action is proud to have endorsed John Edwards.  We thank him for contributing a progressive, pro-environment perspective to the debate and running a hard-fought, honorable campaign.”

 

<P></P>
