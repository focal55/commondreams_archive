<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 1 - Today, Department of Homeland Security 
Secretary Michael Chertoff announced that he is imposing a blanket waiver of 
environmental and land management laws along 470 miles of the U.S./Mexico 
border. Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club have asked the U.S. Supreme 
Court to review the constitutionality of this controversial waiver, tucked away 
in the “Real ID Act,” as a flagrant violation of the separation of powers 
principle that frames the U.S. Constitution. 
</p><p>Below is a statement from Rodger Schlickeisen, 
president of Defenders of Wildlife. </p>
<p>“Thanks to this action by the Bush administration, 
the border is in a sense more lawless now than when Americans first started 
moving west.</p>
<p>“Laws ensuring clean water for us and our 
children—dismissed. Laws protecting wildlife, land, rivers, streams and places 
of cultural significance—just a bother to the Bush administration. Laws giving 
American citizens a voice in the process—gone. Clearly this is out of control. 
</p>
<p>“It is this kind of absolute disregard for the 
well-being and concerns of border communities and the welfare of our wildlife 
and untamed borderlands that has 
forced Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club to take a stand and say ‘No 
more!’</p>
<p>“Just a few weeks ago we filed a petition with the 
U.S. Supreme Court to fight the unconstitutional authority the Bush 
administration has seized to waive any and all laws it views as inconvenient in 
its rush to build an unpopular, ineffective border wall. Today’s egregious abuse 
of power is more proof that this cannot be allowed to continue.”</p><p><a href="http://www.defenders.org/programs_and_policy/habitat_conservation/federal_lands/border_policy/index.php" target="_new">Learn more about what Defenders is doing for species along the border.</a><br>
