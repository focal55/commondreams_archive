	WASHINGTON, DC - June 10 - On Monday, Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.), Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) introduced S. 3099, a bill that prohibits the Defense Department from using government funds to spread propaganda. The legislation also mandates reports within 90 days from both the Pentagon's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office on the Pentagon's propaganda practices.
<p></p>
In late April, the <i>New York Times</i> exposed a secret Pentagon campaign that embedded 75 military analysts -- many of whom were also employed by defense contractors -- in the nation's news media. Media Matters for America documented that analysts in the Pentagon's program appeared or were quoted in major outlets more than 4,500 times. Yet most of the major networks have failed to cover or follow up on the <i>Times'</i> investigation. The Department of Defense has "temporarily" shut down the program pending an ongoing internal review.
<p></p>
Free Press activists and allies have sent more than 100,000 letters to Congress demanding hearings on the Pentagon scandal. Last month, the House voted to cut off funding for Pentagon propaganda.
<p></p>
<b>Josh Silver</b>, executive director of Free Press, issued the following statement:
<p></p>
"This important bill promises to put an end to the insidious propaganda that threatens the core of our democracy. The media's unquestioning embrace of Pentagon warmongering silenced dissent and ignored the facts at a time when both were sorely needed. This willingness to march in lockstep with the U.S. government -- combined with the ongoing attempts to sweep this story under the rug -- has left an indelible stain on American journalism. We urge the Senate to move this critical bill forward with all deliberate speed."
