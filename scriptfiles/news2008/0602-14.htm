WASHINGTON, DC - June 2 - Today, Friends of the Earth Action placed a full page ad on the back page of Roll Call calling on the Senate to fix the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008 so that it makes polluters pay for their global warming pollution and sets carbon emission reduction targets that are in line with science— or ditch the bill and wait to pass a better bill next year.
<p></p>
Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder said, "We appreciate Environment and Public Works Chair Barbara Boxer efforts to debate global warming on the Senate floor, but feel the bill fails the most fundamental test: it doesn’t do what is needed to avoid catastrophic warming.
<p></p>
"Groups outside of the traditional environmental community are joining our 'Fix or Ditch' campaign because they stand in support of at least two fundamental principles of any climate legislation — that polluters pay for 100 percent of their pollution credits through auction, and that Congress establish pollution reduction targets in line with the latest science. We believe the first global warming bill passed in the U.S. will set the foundation for all carbon reduction efforts in the future; there is no time for half measures."
<p></p>
 

The ad running today in Roll Call states: "Congress may get only one shot at passing major legislation in the near term. We ask the Senate to not waste that chance and resist pressure to rush Lieberman-Warner through as written."
