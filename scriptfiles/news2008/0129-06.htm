<p>TUCSON, ARIZONA - January 29 - "In his final State of the Union speech, President Bush failed to offer any effective plan to combat global warming ? the number one threat to endangered species across the globe as well as to human societies ? despite the fact that technological solutions exist. The failure is completely unsurprising given this administration's epic hostility, from Day One, toward addressing the climate crisis. The President continues to oppose binding emissions-reduction targets and commonsense steps such as California's Clean Vehicle Law. 
<p></p>
The window of opportunity to act and avert the most catastrophic effects of global warming demands immediate action. Instead, President Bush's legacy in history will be as the world leader who steadfastly stood in the way. He could leave behind a better legacy by protecting arctic species such as the polar bear and their rapidly melting sea ice." <!-- #EndEditable -->
