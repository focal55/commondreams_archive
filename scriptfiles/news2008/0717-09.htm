WASHINGTON - July 17 - Oil market speculation is dramatically driving 
up oil prices and giving consumers major pain at the pump, environmental groups 
said today in a <a href="http://www.defenders.org/resources/publications/policy_and_legislation/joint_letter_to_senate_regarding_oil_speculation.pdf">letter to Congress</a>. 
</p><p>The 14 groups are urging 
Congress to adopt policies that will rein in oil speculation, restore 
accountability in the oil commodity markets, and give Americans better choices 
to help reduce energy costs across the board.</p>
<p>“Americans need real 
relief, not recycled rhetoric,” said Robert Dewey, vice president for government 
relations at Defenders of Wildlife. “More oil drilling on 
America’s coastlines and pristine lands won’t save 
Americans money – even the Bush Administration admits that. What we need is to 
rein in the rampant oil speculation that’s driven prices through the 
roof.”</p>
<p>Last month, Gerry Ramm, 
an Inland Oil Company senior executive, testified before Congress that 
“excessive speculation on energy trading facilities is the fuel that is driving 
this runaway train in crude oil prices.” </p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, 
the number of speculators who trade oil on paper has tripled. These speculators 
buy up large amounts of oil and sell it back to each other over and over again - 
a single barrel of oil may be traded over 20 times before it is actually used. 
The resulting inflated oil prices end up penalizing drivers at the gas 
pump.</p>
<p>Closing the so-called 
“Enron Loophole” and other sweetheart deals for speculators could dramatically 
reduce the price drivers are paying at the pump, today’s letter states. 
Americans want to see this solution implemented now – over the past week alone, 
well over one million Americans have contacted Congress to request immediate 
action to reduce oil price speculation. </p>

<p>“Addressing the problem 
of oil speculation is a far better deal for the American public than trading 
away our coasts and other special places to help further pad the profits of Big 
Oil,” said Dewey. “Congress will be considering legislation to tackle oil 
speculation as early as this week, and we’re urging our members and activists to 
voice their support for addressing the issue along with the million-plus 
Americans who have done so already.”</p>
