<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 5 - The group of citizen journalists, bloggers and activists convened at the SuperDelegate Transparency Project have produced the only reporting on superdelegate commitments in the race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination that is fully broken down by state, congressional district and delegate and has full and transparent sourcing. No major news organization provides such detail or provides their sources.
<P></P>
The <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Superdelegate_Transparency_Project" target="_new">Superdelegate Transparency Project</a> is the most thorough, accurate and transparent reporting on how superdelegate endorsements compare to popular vote results and delegate counts--district by district. The project does not advocate for one candidate over another or have a position on how superdelegates should determine their votes, but is dedicated to bringing greater transparency to the Democratic nomination process, and will provide a historic record of the superdelegates' effect on the nomination process.
<P></P>
Given last night's results, both Democratic candidates are expected to remain in the race (possibly until the Democratic convention in August), and superdelegates are once again expected to play a key--and perhaps deciding--role in this hotly-contested race.
<P></P>
While major news organizations and political web sites provide unsourced and conflicting delegate and superdelegate counts, <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Superdelegate_Transparency_Project" target="_new">The Superdelegate Transparency Project</a> at <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Congresspedia" target="_new">Congresspedia.org</a> provides delegate-by-delegate breakdowns of endorsements, all with fully transparent sourcing. Congresspedia is part of the Center for Media and Democracy's <a href="http://sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch" target="_new">SourceWatch site</a> -- an encyclopedia of people, issues and organizations shaping the public agenda. The project is also the only citizen-driven, grassroots effort to bring transparency to the superdelegate process. To date, more than 400 volunteers have contributed to different arms of the STP.
<P></P>
The STP is a combined effort of DemConWatch, LiteraryOutpost, OpenLeft, HuffPost's OffTheBus and Congresspedia-a project of the Sunlight Foundation and the Center for Media and Democracy. The organizers of STP represent various political views and loyalties in the race for the Democratic nomination--some neutral, some for Clinton and some for Obama--but had the common purpose of introducing greater transparency and citizen engagement to the Democratic nomination process.

<P></P>
STP tracks the primary and caucus results-Congressional district by Congressional district-for states that have held their races and going forward to the Democratic convention. The project then tracks how superdelegates' endorsements relate to the preferences of rank-and-file voters in those districts and states. The aim of this project is to open up the Democratic nomination process, and to gauge what effect the superdelegates have on the nomination. STP's superdelegate counts are roughly equal to those of the major news organizations, but it is the only project currently tracking this data at the district level and with fully transparent sources.
<P></P>
"Crowdsourcing this project was the only way to tackle such a massive research task," said Congresspedia Managing Editor Conor Kenny, "and going fully transparent with our sources was the only way to maintain credibility on such a controversial topic and, really, seemed only appropriate in light of the inscrutability of the whole superdelegate process. This is a testament to the amazing power of citizen journalism when it's done right."
<P></P>
STP currently lists 794 Democratic officials as superdelegates. Most news organizations are still using 796 or 795, but the Democratic National Committee has confirmed the STP number, as reported by DemConWatch. STP tracks the fluidity of superdelegate endorsements--including when they switch or move from decided to undecided. Now, the STP also provides profiles of and interviews with SuperDelegates, which were organized by the HuffingtonPost's OffTheBus project.
<P></P>
"We couldn't be happier with the way OffTheBus met the challenge of working on the project, whose size and scope made it difficult for MSM to handle. The Superdelegate Transparency Project's focus on the central question, "Who are the superdelegates?" matches perfectly with OffTheBus's mission," said OffTheBus director Amanda Michel. "As soon as we signed on, hundreds of our members, and a new corps of citizen journalists, stepped forward and produced hundreds of profiles and helped generate more than a dozen stories."
<P></P>
The idea for the STP came from Florida-based technology consultant, Mark Myers, who is not a registered Democrat and did not vote in the primary. "I want people to have direct access to information regarding the superdelegates. Project participants are giving their fellow citizens a tool to evaluate the extent to which their interests are being either represented or ignored by superdelegates. I saw an opportunity for citizens to stand up on their own and shine a light onto this process."<!-- #EndEditable -->
