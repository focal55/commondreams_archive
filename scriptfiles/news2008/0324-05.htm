<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 24 - Congressman Keith Ellison (D-Minneapolis) called on Minnesotans of all faiths and beliefs to take a moment today to pay their respects to the 4,000 young American men and women who have died in the Iraqi War.  "Let us all join together and mourn our fallen American heroes.  They are true American patriots who paid the ultimate sacrifice and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones," Ellison stated.
<P></P>
A roadside bomb killed four U.S. soldiers in southern Baghdad on Easter Sunday, bringing the overall death toll in the five-year Iraq War to at least 4,000.
<P></P>
"The Bush Administration boasts of the success of the so-called 'surge,' but rarely do they mention the sacrifice it has taken on American lives and treasure," Ellison commented.  Last year was the deadliest year for the United States Army with, 901 deaths compared to 850 in 2004.  Nearly 30,000 Americans have been wounded – many severely, with lost limbs and Traumatic Brain Injury.  Thousands more suffer upon their return home from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
<P></P>
"The President launched this war under false pretenses on March 19, 2003," Ellison stated.
<P></P>
In early February 2003, then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld projected the war in Iraq would not last even a half a year saying, "It could last, you know, six days, six weeks.  I doubt six months."
<P></P>
"Five years later, this war continues with no end in sight – now the 2nd longest war in American history – 2nd only to another quagmire, the Vietnam War," Ellison said.
<P></P>
"In late 2002, the White House Budget Director estimated the cost of the war would be in the 'range of $50 billion to $60 billion.'  Now leading economists estimate it will cost taxpayers at least $3 TRILLION," the 5th District Congressman said.
<P></P>
"We are currently spending $12 BILLION a month in Iraq, and have now lost 4,000 of our best and brightest young men and women, and another 30,000 injured.  Little wonder we are in an 'Iraq Recession,'" Ellison stated
<P></P>
"Minnesota taxpayers are projected to pay $3.3 BILLION in Iraq War costs for fiscal year 2009.  Instead of throwing more and more money at Iraq, Minnesota could hire over 57,000 new elementary school teachers, or hire almost 74,000 public safety officers, or provide over 963,000 people with health care.  Not to mention the number of bridges and roads we could have made safer," Ellison stated.
<P></P>
"It is long past time to end this war for the sake of America's young patriots, our priorities and our moral standing in the world.  It is also time to end this war for the sake of what this Administration so callously calls 'collateral damage,' and you and I know as Iraqi civilians," Ellison stated.
<P></P>
"Vice President Cheney made his thoughts abundantly clear to ABC news reporter, Martha Raddatz, of his regard for the American public's viewpoints on Iraq in his March 19th interview.  When told '2/3 of Americans say it's not worth fighting, and they're looking at the value gain versus the cost in American lives, certainly Iraqi lives.'  The Vice President responded:  'So?'
<P></P>
'So – you don't care what the American people think?' Raddatz queried.
<P></P>
'No…' the Vice President responded.
<P></P>
"Mr. Vice President, Mr. President, on behalf of the families of the 4,000 fallen and the 30,000 grievously wounded; on behalf of the countless Iraqis dead and wounded – we do care!  And we will not stop caring until we bring this War to an end."  Ellison concluded.<!-- #EndEditable -->
