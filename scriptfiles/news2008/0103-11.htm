<p>NEW YORK - January 3 - Amnesty International today strongly condemned the eruption of post-election violence across Kenya and called on political leaders to prevent further bloodshed by avoiding condoning attacks on their rivals' supporters. The organization expressed concern about continuing reports of killings by police and a striking increase in rapes by gangs and individuals.
<p></p>
More than 300 individuals are reported dead and 75,000 people have been displaced, according to the human rights organization.
<p></p>
Some of the more recent violence occurring in some areas with a history of ethnic conflict appears to have been perpetrated by anti-government mobs against members of President Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group, in apparent retaliation for suspected election rigging during presidential and parliamentary elections on Dec. 27.
<p></p>
Amnesty International called on the Kenyan government and political party leaders to take all possible measures to prevent the violence and to commit themselves publicly to the respect and protection of the human rights of all citizens.
<p></p>
"Political leaders must not condone, explicitly or implicitly, violence against supposed supporters of their rivals," said Erwin van der Borght, director of Amnesty International's Africa Program.
<p></p>
Amnesty International is concerned at continuing reports of killings by police. One individual was reportedly shot dead today during skirmishes between police and demonstrators in Mombasa.
<p></p>
"The security forces must show restraint and comply with international standards on the use of force," said Ann Corbett, Kenya country specialist for Amnesty International USA. "The government must establish an independent inquiry into the dozens of shooting deaths of protesters by police reported in Nairobi's Kibera slum, as well as the towns of Kisumu and Mombasa and elsewhere throughout the country. The Kenyan government and all political parties must respect and protect all Kenyans' human rights during this crisis and take steps to prevent further violence."
<p></p>
Among the dead in the wave of violence prompted were more than 30 people -- mostly women and children fleeing from armed youths -- who were deliberately burned to death after they sought refuge in a church in Eldoret town in the Rift Valley on January 1.
<p></p>
Medical staff at the Women's Hospital in Nairobi have also reported a sharp increase in the number of rapes of women and girls being committed by gangs and individuals as part of the post-election violence.
<p></p>
"The Kenyan government must arrange rapid humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced and to provide all necessary security for humanitarian relief workers," said van der Borght.
<p></p>
Informal roadblocks have been set up across the country by violent youth gangs, some of them armed with machetes, sticks and stones. Some of the displaced have been evacuated by the Kenyan government under military escort or by airplanes to safer locations, including from Eldoret to Nairobi and to other parts of Kenya. Thousands are reported to be fleeing to neighboring countries, particularly Uganda.
<p></p>
<b>Background:</b><br>

On December 27, Kenya held presidential and parliamentary elections. On December 30, the official Electoral Commission of Kenya announced that President Mwai Kibaki had won over opposition candidate Raila Odinga. Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) won a large majority of parliamentary seats over Mwai Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) and other parties, but disputed the announced loss of the presidential election.
<p></p>
Kibaki was quickly sworn in on December 30. Election observers have questioned the credibility of the counting and tallying of the presidential vote, about which even the Chair of the Electoral Commission of Kenya has lately expressed doubts. Diplomatic efforts are undergoing at the international and regional level, including by the African Union and South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and by Kenyan NGOs, to find a solution for the political impasse and to stem the violence.
