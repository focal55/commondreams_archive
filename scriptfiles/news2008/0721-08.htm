WASHINGTON - July 21 - Michelle Gray, from Springfield, Ohio, works hard every day as a nurse for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. Thanks to her union, SEIU District 1199 WKO, she has access to quality health care at an affordable price.
<p></p>
Gray's daughter is not so fortunate.  A single mother, Gray's daughter works for a small nursing home business that struggles to provide a health care plan for its workers. While the plan covers her daughter, it won't cover her grandson, because his autism is considered a preexisting condition.  Instead, taxpayers pick up the tab for the insurance companies' refusal to provide affordable coverage for Gray's grandson, with his care paid for through Ohio's CareSource program.
<p></p>
It is time for a change. Only by working together will America fix our health care crisis. It will require all of us - workers, businesses, community leaders, and elected officials - working together for real solutions that make sure everyone has good coverage they can count on.  Instead, the health insurance industry is launching a sham effort designed to maintain the status quo of high costs, low quality and unreliable coverage.
<p></p>
By not working with existing groups focused on reform, the health insurance industry is signaling that the only solution they are interested in is one that continues to grow their profits," said SEIU Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger. "Just as in 1994, the CEOs talk a good game about teamwork, but their actions show they are preparing to derail any change that would help working families."
<p></p>
A lot has changed in the 14 years since the health insurance industry last blocked health care reform:
<p></p>
* Health insurance premiums rose 87 percent in just six years between 2000 and 2006.
<p></p>
* In the six years between 2000 and 2006, median household income actually fell by 2 percent.
<p></p>
* In January 2004, gas cost $1 per gallon.
<p></p>
* In 2006 alone, the nation's six largest health insurers made almost $11 billion in profits.
<p></p>
* Google went from a research project to one of the world's largest companies in history.
<p></p>
* In the past 10 years, health insurers have spent more than $1 billion in lobbying.
<p></p>
* In the past 14 years, more there are 8 million more Americans without any health care coverage.
<p></p>
* The Emmy Award-winning medical drama series ER aired its first season.
<p></p>
"The health care insurance industry may think it is still 1994 and that they can block change," said Burger. "This time they will lose. This time we will pass quality, affordable health care for every hard working American."
