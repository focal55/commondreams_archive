WASHINGTON, DC - May 23 - Bread for the World president Rev. David Beckmann issued the following statement today concerning the 2008 Farm Bill, which won a congressional override of President Bush's veto on Wednesday, though procedural problems will delay its final passage into law:
<p></p>
"Bread for the World has been describing the final iteration of the 2008 Farm Bill as 'half a loaf.'  We're pleased with the stronger nutrition programs for which we and many others fought so hard and applaud the authorization of the Hunger Free Communities grant program. However, we eagerly look forward to making the missing half of the loaf a reality.  That includes dramatic, meaningful reform of a broken, inequitable system of agricultural commodity programs and a food aid program that begins and ends with the needs of hungry people.
<p></p>
"The growing global hunger crisis demands a more efficient and equitable global agricultural system and a different and better safety net here at home.  In five years time, when this legislation is again up for renewal, we ask Speaker Pelosi and like-minded lawmakers to hold true to their promise that this farm bill will be the last of its kind.  We can, and must do better by the world's hungry people.
<p></p>
"Our stand on the 2008 Farm Bill comes from a Biblical imperative that calls for a 'harvest of righteousness' (James 3:18). We will keep on working to reform the farm bill until it truly serves the needs of poor farm and rural families and all people around the world who struggle to feed themselves and their children.
<p></p>
<i>Bread for the World is a collective Christian voice urging our nation's decision makers to end hunger at home and abroad. By changing policies, programs, and conditions that allow hunger and poverty to persist, we provide help and opportunity far beyond the communities where we live. <a href="http://www.bread.org" target="_new">www.bread.org</a></i><!-- #EndEditable -->
