June 16 - The REAL News reporter Carlos Basilone covered the event of Union members from across Ontario showing up in Oshawa Thursday to show solidarity for Canadian Auto Workers Local 222.
<p></p>
Over two thousand union members gathered to protest and listen to vitriolic protestations from union leaders.  "We've still got a hell of a fight, because you're dealing with the most arrogant sons of bitches that ever faced [inaudible], and that's the people that are running this company in Detroit."
<p></p>
The autoworkers had setup a blockade at the General Motors Canadian headquarters in Oshawa on June 4th, one day after GM announced they would be shutting down a truck assembly plant cutting 2600 hundred jobs next year.
<p></p>
General Motors took the Union to court asking for an injunction against the blockade and seeking damages of 1.5 million dollars from the CAW and five of its directors.
