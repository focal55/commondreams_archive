<p>PARIS/JERUSALEM - April 24 - Environmental Working Group (EWG) renewed its call for all
infant formula makers to remove the toxic chemical BPA from their containers
in light of recent actions by the governments of the United States and
Canada, as well as action by major retailers to pull products made with BPA
from store shelves.
<p></p>
Last week NIH increased its level of concern that BPA may be linked to a
number of serious reproductive and developmental problems including breast
cancer, early puberty, prostate effects, and behavioral problems.
Concurrently, Canada determined that BPA meets criteria for listing as a
"dangerous substance," and announced actions to ban the chemical's use in
baby products, including infant formula cans. In the wake of both
announcements, major retailers and manufacturers announced they would remove
BPA bottles and other plastics products. However no one has addressed
contamination of formula, which is a key source of exposure for babies.
<p></p>
Previous formula testing by EWG and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has shown that BPA leaches from the plastic lining of metal cans into liquid
formula, and that formula contains more BPA than would leach from a bottle.
<p></p>
"Government health agencies and major retailers are taking steps to
dramatically reduce BPA exposures for babies, and formula makers must follow
suit," said EWG Executive Director Richard Wiles. "Our studies show babies
get even higher doses of BPA from the lining of formula cans than they do
from plastic bottles, dramatically increasing potential health risks for
formula-fed infants."
<p></p>
Wiles sent letters to representatives from Nature's One, Nestle, PBM
Products, Mead-Johnson, The Hain-Celestial Group, Wyeth Nutritional, and
Abbott Laboratories urging each take the necessary steps to remove BPA from
their products. All 7 letters and our previous work on BPA in infant formula
can be found <a href="http://www.ewg.org/node/26429" target="_new">here</a>
