<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 16 - More than 800 citizens groups from 59 countries on
every continent presented a petition on Tuesday, January 15 to World
Bank President Robert B. Zoellick, expressing concerns about the
International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID),
whose Administrative Council Mr. Zoellick chairs. <br>
<br>
Last May, the government of Bolivia became the first country in the
world to withdraw from ICSID, citing the court's record of favoring
narrow corporate interests over the public good.&nbsp; That court is now
refusing to respect the Bolivian government's actions and allowing a
case brought by a European telecommunications company to proceed. <br>
<br>
The global petition reflects growing concerns around the world about a
system of investor rights that undermines democracy and human rights.&nbsp;
Many of the signatory groups first became aware of these problems
through the notorious Bechtel v Bolivia case.&nbsp; In 2001, a subsidiary of
Bechtel sued South America's poorest country over a failed water
privatization project.&nbsp; After five years of intense public pressure,
the company dropped the case in 2006.<br>

<br>
As noted in the petition, Bolivia is just one of several governments
that are challenging the excessive investor protections in free trade
agreements and bilateral investment treaties.&nbsp; ICSID is the most widely
used mechanism for enforcing these rules.<br>
<br>
Although the Bolivian government followed proper procedures in
withdrawing from ICSID, a tribunal is scheduled to be formed soon to
hear a case brought by Euro Telecom International (ETI), a company
incorporated in the Netherlands whose owners include Telecom Italia and
the Spanish Telefónica.&nbsp; ETI owns 50% of ENTEL, which provides more
than 60% of Bolivia's telephone services.<br>
<br>
The petitioners include 863 labor, environmental, religious, consumer,
small farmer, human rights, women's, development, and peace
organizations from five continents.&nbsp; The Institute for Policy Studies,
a Washington, DC-based research organization, was the initial drafter
of the petition.&nbsp; Among the other nearly 50 U.S. groups that endorsed
the petition are:&nbsp; Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen's
Global Trade Watch, National Lawyers Guild, Food and Water Watch and
Jubilee USA. <br>
