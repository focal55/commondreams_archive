<p>WASHINGTON - January 28 - The President’s spokesperson informed us today that the President will have no new ideas in his speech tonight.  That’s unfortunate.  Mr. President: Our country is in grave economic trouble.  We have a housing finance meltdown going on while energy costs spiral up and down.  Affordable and accessible healthcare is out of reach to almost 50 million Americans with 6 million alone added during this President’s tenure.  Our educational system has left far too many children behind, while our bridges are literally falling down in America.
<P></P>
Mr. President: our country needs an economic stimulus package that will result in something more than pocket change for most working families.
<P></P>
Mr. President: The best American economic stimulus package you could offer the American public is to end this war in Iraq.
<P></P>
We are currently spending $10 Billion a month in Iraq, more than $2.5 Billion a week. 
<P></P>
Taxpayers in Minnesota alone paid $11 Billion for the cost of the Iraq War through 2007. For that amount of money, Minnesota could have provided:
<P></P><ul>
<li>over 3 million people with Health Care OR

<br><li>over 13 million Homes with Renewable Electricity OR

<br><li>over 250,000 Public Safety Officers OR

<br><li>nearly 175,000 Music and Arts Teachers OR

<br><li>over 1.2 million  Scholarships for University Students OR

<br><li>1,300 New Elementary Schools OR

<br><li>almost 70,000 Affordable Housing Units OR

<br><li>over 3.5 million Children with Health Care OR

<br><li>over 1.5 million Head Start Places for Children OR

<br><li>almost 200,000 Elementary School Teachers OR

<br><li>over 130,000 Port Container Inspectors
</ul>
<P></P>
The President’s $150 Billion economic stimulus package represents a little over ONE year in war funding for Iraq. 
<P></P>
I would urge the President to work with Congress to bring our brave men and women home from Iraq now – and put hard-working Americans tax dollars to use building American schools, roads, jobs, hospitals and small businesses.  That is a message on the state of our union worth giving.<!-- #EndEditable -->
