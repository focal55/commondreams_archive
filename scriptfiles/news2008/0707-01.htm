 WASHINGTON - July 7 - Amnesty International USA will host a discussion of the anti-Muslim riots in the state of Gujarat, India, with comments from Ms. Nashrin Hussain, the daughter of former Member of Parliament Ahsan Jafri, civil rights activist and journalist Ms. Teesta Setalvad and Gujarat’s former Additional Director General of Police and Chief Intelligence Officer Mr. R. B. Sreekumar.
<P></P>
In the 2002 Gujarat riots, 2,000 Muslims were killed by Hindu mobs, and hundreds of Muslim women were gang raped. Few perpetrators have been held accountable for these crimes. The following speakers will comment on their continuing efforts to pursue justice six years later:
<P></P>
Ms. Nashrin Hussain is the daughter of former Member of Parliament, Ahsan Jafri, who was burnt to death by Hindu rioters during the Gujarat riots in 2002. Mr. Jafri was a top official in the current governing party, the Indian National Congress Party. In the aftermath of the Gujarat massacre, Ms. Hussain worked with several organizations to bring justice to the victims.
<P></P>
Ms. Teesta Setalvad is a Mumbai-based civil rights activist and journalist. She reported for the Mumbai editions of The Daily (India) and The Indian Express newspapers. Appalled by the communal violence during the Bombay riots, she, along with activist husband Javed Anand, quit full-time journalism in 1993 to start a monthly magazine called Communalism Combat.
<P></P>
Mr. R. B. Sreekumar was the Additional Director General of Police and Chief Intelligence Officer in Gujarat during the brutal mass murder and rape of Muslims by Hindu mobs. He left his post soon after, and has since become an outspoken voice on the violence in Gujarat.
