<p>RICHMOND, VA - February 28 - The American Civil Liberties 
Union and ACLU of Virginia today filed a federal lawsuit against a 
Virginia county’s voting officials for 
refusing to allow a resident to vote when he was unable to produce 
identification. Virginia law allows registered voters in 
state elections to vote without an ID, once they have signed an identity 
verification form.</p>

<p>R. Leigh 
Gillette showed up at a Prince William County, 
Virginia polling place on November 6 about 
30 minutes before the polls closed. Because he was on his way to a recreation 
facility and his wife was driving, Gillette was not carrying an ID. When a poll 
worker told him he could not vote without ID, Gillette asked to speak to the 
person in charge who also told him he could not vote. Gillette was never offered 
an Affirmation of Identity form as required by 
Virginia law.</p>
<p>“This is 
our number one complaint from voters on Election Day,” said ACLU of Virginia 
Executive Director Kent Willis. “Contrary to state law, the spirit of democracy 
and common sense, voting officials in Virginia frequently lead voters to believe 
they must have an ID to vote. In Mr. Gillette’s case, it was more than 
misleading – it was an outright denial, even after he questioned the decision by 
voting officials.”</p>
<p>Today’s 
complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of 
Virginia. The ACLU charged that the county election officials’ actions in 
requiring voters to present identification in order to vote violates the 
Constitution’s First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
In addition to being unnecessary, a voter ID requirement may prevent 
many individuals from voting at all. It is estimated that 20 million Americans – 
many of whom are low-income, elderly or racial minorities – do not own 
government-issued IDs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“What 
happened in Virginia raises grave concerns about the 
integrity of the voting process across the country,” said Neil Bradley, 
Associate Director of the ACLU Voting Rights Project. “Voter ID laws are bad 
enough when they are codified into law, but this case highlights another 
complicated problem – de facto voter ID laws imposed arbitrarily by local 
election officials. No matter what you call it, this is an unconstitutional 
violation of the fundamental right to vote.” </p>
<p>Virginia lawmakers recently attempted to 
amend the state law to require voters to show an ID at the polls. The ACLU 
opposed the legislation, noting that it is unnecessary because voting without an 
ID does not pose a threat to the integrity of the electoral process. The ACLU 
relied on a recent national study of electoral practices which concluded that 
there is no history of in person voter fraud in the 
U.S. The bill 
failed.</p>
<p>Attorneys 
in this case are Bradley of the ACLU Voting Rights Project, Rebecca K. Glenberg 
of the ACLU of Virginia, and cooperating attorney Victor M. Glasberg of the law 
firm Victor M. Glasberg &amp; Associates.</p>

today’s complaint is available at: <br><a href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/gen/34243lgl20080228.html" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/votingrights/gen/34243lgl20080228.html</a></p>
