WASHINGTON, DC - June 9 - Following the failure of the Climate Security Act on Friday, a group of young people presented murals painted by mothers and children to members of Congress from 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, calling for stronger climate leadership. The murals serve as a sharp reminder to Congress that the American public is ahead of their elected representatives on the issue of climate, and are demanding that Congress step up with strong, science-based policy.

“We’ve only got one sky, and we’ve got to make sure it stays clean for our children,” said Gillian Caldwell, mother of two and campaign director for 1Sky, a new collaborative national campaign of more than 60 diverse organizations.

1Sky supports the passage of a stronger, science-based bill in the next Congress to ensure that future generations inherit a livable climate.

“The failure of the deeply-flawed Lieberman-Warner bill gives us a fresh chance to protect our childrens’ climate,” said Betsy Taylor, president of 1Sky’s Board of Directors. “New climate legislation must focus on reducing carbon emissions quickly and effectively, and on schedule with or even ahead of recommendations made by international climate scientists so the U.S. can be a leader in this field.”

“Congress must find the courage to take the steps that science says is necessary to halt global warming, before it’s too late,” said Caldwell. “With gas prices soaring, there couldn’t be a better time for national leadership on climate and clean energy.”
