WASHINGTON - July 10 - </b>Yesterday in the House, we had a
moment of silence for the troops.&nbsp; Today it is time to speak out on behalf
of those troops who will be in Iraq
for at least another year, courageously representing our nation while their
Commander in Chief sent them on a mission that was based on falsehoods about
the threat of WMDs from Iraq.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Throughout the summer and fall of 2002, the Congress, the media and the
American people heard the terrifying drumbeat of fear from the Bush White House
in the form of loud, well-advertised and orchestrated chanting by the President
and his Administration about "Weapons of Mass Destruction,"
"Nuclear Threats," "Biological Weapons," "Chemical
Weapons," "Threats of Imminent Attack," all calculated to gain
media attention, public support and Congressional support for a war against
Iraq.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This afternoon I will introduce a single Article of Impeachment of the
President.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Article is entitled:&nbsp; "Deceiving Congress with Fabricated
Threats of Iraq WMDs to Fraudulently Obtain Support for an Authorization of the
Use of Military Force Against Iraq."&nbsp; The Impeachment resolution
focuses narrowly on what the President presented to Congress in the
Authorization of the Use of Military Force.&nbsp; It does not address the
voluminous evidence of orchestrated deceptions which have been well documented
by various governmental, non-governmental and media sources.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I understand that many members of Congress voted in good faith to
authorize the use of force against Iraq.&nbsp; And I understand that
many in the media supported that action. When the President of the United States
makes representations on matters of life and death, we all want to believe him
and give him the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Trust is the glue which holds the
fabric of our nation together.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Those in Congress and in the media who acted on the President's
representations of the threat of Iraq WMDs did so trusting that those
representations were honest.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they were not. We all know
the consequences of the war, the loss of lives and injury to our troops, the
deaths of innocent Iraqis, the cost to the American taxpayers.&nbsp; There has
been another consequence: Great damage to our Constitution through an
unnecessary, illegal war and the destruction of the superior role of Congress
in the life of this nation.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Congress must, in the name of the American people, use the one remedy
which the Founders provided for an Executive who gravely abused his power:
Impeachment.&nbsp; Congress must reassert itself as a co-equal branch of government;
bring this President to an accounting, and in doing so reestablish the people's
trust in Congress and in our United
  States system of government.&nbsp; We must
not let this President's conduct go unchallenged and thereby create a precedent
which undermines the Constitution.</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the final analysis this is about our Constitution and whether a
President can be held accountable for his actions and his deceptions,
especially when the effects of those actions have been so calamitous for America, Iraq and the world.&nbsp; Unless
Congress reasserts itself as the power branch of government which the Founders
intended, our experiment with a republican form of Government may be nearing an
end.&nbsp; But when Congress acts to hold this President accountable it will be
redeeming the faith that the Founders had in the power of a system of checks
and balances which preserves our republic.</span></font></p>

trailers in Iraq.
Although intelligence experts disputed the purpose of the trailers,
Administration officials repeatedly asserted that they were mobile biological
weapons laboratories. In total, President Bush, Vice President Cheney,
Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Powell, and National Security Advisor Rice made 34
misleading statements about the trailers in 27 separate public appearances.
Shortly after the (mobile trailers were found, the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) issued an unclassified white paper
evaluating the trailers. The white paper was released without coordination with
other members of the intelligence community, however. It was disclosed later
that engineers from DIA who examined the trailers concluded that they were most
likely used to produce hydrogen for artillery weather balloons. A former senior
intelligence official reported that "only one of 15 intelligence analysts
assembled from three agencies to discuss the issue in June endorsed the white
paper conclusion." House Committee on Government Reform- Minority Staff. <i><span style="font-style: italic;">Iraq</span></i><i><span style="font-style: italic;"> on the Record: Bush Administration's Public

had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on

Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not
yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours,
and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya,
North Korea or Iran.

weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the
use of force.” Rycroft, Matthew; Private Secretary to Prime Minister Tony
