<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 28 - "Every day, tens of millions of Americans who lack health care coverage live in fear that with just one illness or accident, they will have to face a mountain of medical bills that they can't even begin to pay. Despite the outcry from businesses and health care providers, and the fact that the number of Americans uninsured continues to grow in our tough economy, the government has failed to adequately address the problem. With Congress either unable or unwilling to make the necessary reforms to our health care system, we must capitalize on the innovations in health care already taking place in states across the country by giving states additional tools and funding to implement reforms. People from all over the political spectrum have agreed that state-based health care reform is the best way to break the stalemate that has gripped Congress for far too long. As we recognize 'Cover the Uninsured Week,' we must recommit ourselves to solving the health care crisis which affects so many across our nation."
<br>
<br>

April 27-May3 marks Cover the Uninsured Week, a week to focus on the 47 million Americans, including nine million children, who are living without health care coverage.  Senator Feingold, along with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), has introduced the State Based Health Care Reform Act to break the logjam in Congress over health care.  More information on Senator Feingold’s bill is available at <a href="http://feingold.senate.gov/statebased.html" target="_new">http://feingold.senate.gov/statebased.html</a>.
