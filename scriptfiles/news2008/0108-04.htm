<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 8 - On January 11, the International Day to Shut Down Guantanamo,
protests will be held outside the US Southern Command in Miami and all
over the country. Six years after the first prisoners arrived at the
infamous prison—their orange jumpsuits now synonymous with
unconscionable acts of torture—veterans, lawyers, activists, and family
members of detainees are calling for the closure of Guantanamo, with
two days of visual, powerful actions around Guantanamo's HQ at Southern
Command.

"All prisoners deserve humane treatment and fair trials, which is not
happening in Guantánamo," says retired US Army Colonel Ann Wright. "US
federal courts, not military commissions, should hear the cases against
those charged with terrorist acts and the infamous prison in Guantanamo
should be immediately shut down."

      <br>
      <br>
      Last January CODEPINK Cofounder Medea Benjamin led a first-ever
international delegation of former prisoners, families of prisoners,
and human rights advocates to Guantanamo, Cuba to hold a conference on
prison abuses and to protest outside the US Naval Base. Since then,
Omar Deghayes—whose mother and brother were part of the delegation—was
released after 6 years of detention without charge or trial. "I do not
have hatred toward Americans," wrote Deghayes in a statement to
CODEPINK upon release. "I know that many Americans worked hard for my
rights and for the rights of other prisoners. I ask that you continue
to work hard to ensure that due process is provided for all prisoners
and to force the closing of the prison in Guantanamo."
