MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota - July 7 - A press conference on Wednesday, July 9, at noon, will be held on the South Steps of the Capitol Building in St. Paul.  Minnesota political and religious leaders will be fasting and speaking out to kick off a campaign to build public opposition to U.S. military action against Iran.
 <P></P>
 
U.S. Congressman Keith Ellison, Mayor R. T. Rybak, St. Paul City Council President Karen Lantry, Lutheran Bishop Craig Johnson, Methodist Bishop Sally Dyck, Presbyterian Synod Executive Phil Johnson, are among those who have signed on to a statement opposing war on Iran. U.S. Congresswoman Betty McCollum and Congressman Ellison are sending representatives who will be among the speakers.
 <P></P>
With over 4,000 deaths of U.S. soldiers in the Iraq war and over 600,000 deaths of Iraqi civilians, Minnesota leaders are fasting to show the depth of their commitment to prevent the human suffering another war would cause.
  <P></P>
The U.S. intelligence community said in November in an unclassified National Intelligence Estimate that it concluded with "high confidence" that Iran had halted an effort to develop a nuclear weapon in fall 2003.  Yet Bush and Israeli officials continue to discuss military options against Iran.
  <P></P>
Minnesotans from all walks of life are shocked and dismayed at the possibility of U.S. involvement in another war.   Reverend Gwin Pratt of St. Luke Presbyterian Church in Wayzata speaks for many Minnesotans with his strong bi-partisan message, "NO - to another war!"
 <P></P>
State Representative Alice Hausman states that, "The tragedy of our current situation is that we fail to admit the cost of the war in human lives and the economic devastation to our country."
 <P></P>
Minneapolis City Council member Cam Gordon states, "Trying to solve our conflicts through military action continues to be a disasterous failure. It's time that all Minnesotans stand up and call for diplomatic solutions." 
 <P></P>
The event was organized by Women Against Military Madness (WAMM) and Twin Cities Peace
Campaign.
 <P></P>
This is the statement that Minnesota leaders have signed:

 
 <P></P>
We are fasting and speaking out today to demonstrate our resolve to oppose United States military action against Iran.  Our fast represents the depth of our commitment to prevent the deaths, destruction, hunger and misery of another war.

 
 <P></P>
Our country was led into the invasion and occupation of Iraq by false evidence of weapons of mass destruction and false pronouncements that Iraq was preparing to attack us.

 
 <P></P>
We strongly oppose our country being led into war again by misleading intelligence and unfounded allegations regarding Iran.

  <P></P>

We are a democracy and we believe that our government should listen to its citizens and pursue all diplomatic measures before taking military action.

 <P></P>

We believe the people of Iran deserve to live free of threats to their country and once again we urge American citizens to oppose United States military action against Iran.
