<p>NATIONWIDE - January 31 - In light of published reports that the Bush administration is planning to keep as many as 130,000 troops in Iraq past July, Military Families Speak Out, the largest organization of military families to oppose a war in the nation's history, is renewing its call for Congress to cut off funding for the continuation of the war in Iraq and mandate the swift and safe return of all troops now stationed there.
<P></P>
President Bush, just months after announcing troop reductions in Iraq, is now indicating that the number of troops in Iraq may remain higher than last year's pre-escalation troop level.
<P></P>"As the mother of a soldier who is now fighting in a war that I and the majority of voters disapprove of, I am appalled that the President would rather continue risking my son's life than admit to the American people that his so-called ' surge' has failed to bring real security and political reconciliation to Iraq," said MFSO member Marge Haracz of Mundelein, IL, whose son is currently in serving with the Army in Iraq. "I am also appalled by the failure of the Congress to use their ' power of the purse' to end this war.  As long as the President has one dime of taxpayer money to spend on the war, he will keep US troops in harm's way."
<P></P>
"Almost five years into this unjustifiable war, the betrayal of our service men and women, and their families continues unabated," added Nancy Lessin, co-founder of Military Families Speak Out. "What President Bush refers to as 'troop strength' is really troop destruction. Each day that this war continues, one or more troop deaths occur, and more servicemen and women are put at risk for a lifetime of pain from physical and psychological injuries. Iraqi children, women and men continue to be caught in the violence of a war that should never have started and must be brought to an end. In the next months Congress will once again be voting on war funding bills. We once again call on all in Congress to stop funding the war in Iraq, and instead to fully fund the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, and the care they need when they return."
