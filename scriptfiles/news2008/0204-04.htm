<p>ATLANTA, GA - February 4 - With the <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_involved/freedom_to_marry_week_2008.php">11th  annual Freedom to Marry Week, February 10-16, 2008</a> just 6 days away, the  number of <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_involved/freedom_to_marry_week_2008_events.php">events</a> scheduled across the country to speak out, and seek support, for marriage  equality continues to grow!</p>

<p>“Every year, right around President Lincoln's Birthday and  Valentine's Day, gay and non-gay people around the country gather to talk about  our lives, our loves and our families, celebrate the victories from the year  before and continue the fight for the freedom to marry." said Evan  Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry and author of <em>Why Marriage Matters: America, Equality and  Gay People's Right to Marry</em>.&nbsp; “As Al  Gore and a unanimous appellate court in New York have both just shown, the more  people are asked to think through how the denial of marriage harms couples and  their kids, the more they rise to fairness.”</p>
<p>Wolfson  is referring to <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/press_center/al_gore_transcript.php">Al  Gore’s endorsement of the freedom to marry</a> in January and last Friday’s <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_informed/landscape/judicial.php">New  York appellate court ruling</a> that valid out-of-state marriages of same-sex  couples must be legally recognized in <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/new_york.php">New York</a>.</p>
