<p>NEW YORK - March 19 - Entergy today announced its plans to conduct an independent safety assessment of the Indian Point nuclear power plant and emergency planning. The following is a response by Riverkeeper’s Policy Director Lisa Rainwater:
<br>
<br>
“An independent safety assessment is not an assessment contracted and paid for by the company needing an assessment. There are times when the federal government needs to step in and put taxpayers’ dollars to work for the sake of public health and safety. This is one of those times. A true Independent Safety Assessment should be overseen by federal and state regulators and include a citizen advisory panel. If Entergy were truly concerned about taxpayer dollars, it would cover the full costs of emergency planning and leave regulating and nuclear oversight to government agencies charged with protecting public health and safety.”
