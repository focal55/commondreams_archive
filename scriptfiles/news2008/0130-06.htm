<p>WASHINGTON - January 30 -Progressives will hold their own Presidential debate here Sunday when former presidential candidate Ralph Nader, Democrat-turned-Green Rep. Cynthia McKinney and others on the Green Party Presidential ballot Feb. 5 will participate in what is being billed as "A Presidential Debate That Matters."
<P></P>
The debate will be held Sunday, Jan. 13, at 2 p.m. at the Herbst Theater/Veterans Memorial Building, 401 Van Ness Avenue.
<P></P>
A NEWS CONFERENCE* is scheduled with candidates at 1 p.m., shortly before the debate begins. This is the best, and maybe only, opportunity to conduct interviews.
<P></P>
Ex-Rep. McKinney, former Green Party presidential candidate Nader (an undeclared candidate), university Hip-Hop professor Jared Ball, environmental engineer Kent Mesplay, actor/union organizer Jesse Johnson Jr. and Texas political organizer Kat Swift are confirmed as participants.
<P></P>
"Peace Mom" Cindy Sheehan will co-moderate the debate with former President of the SF Board of Supervisors Matt Gonzalez. Other co-hosts include San Francisco Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi, Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, KPFA anchor Aimee Allison and Board of Education member Mark Sanchez.
<P></P>
"This is an opportunity for those opposed to the war, who support healthcare for all and want to address global warming to hear from the most progressive Presidential candidates in the U.S. today," said John Morton of the Green Presidential Debate Committee.
<P></P>
