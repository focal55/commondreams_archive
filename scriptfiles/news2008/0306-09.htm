<p>LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - March 6 - The International Whaling Commission (IWC) is holding an intersessional meeting this week in London to discuss an impasse between those countries which support whale conservation, and the minority, led by the government of Japan, that advocates a return to widespread commercial whaling.
A global ban on commercial whaling was approved by member nations of the IWC in 1986, yet since the ban came into effect, more than 30,000 whales have been killed for commercial purposes, most by Japan and Norway.  Thursday’s attempt to resolve the issue comes as Japan’s Southern Ocean whaling season comes to an end and plans are made for next year’s hunt.
 <p></p>
“Our planet's great whales face more threats today than at anytime in history, yet the Government of Japan continues to hijack an international forum for a pro-whaling agenda,” said Patrick Ramage, Director of IFAW's Global Whale program.  “Japan’s illegal whaling should not be used as a bargaining chip to legitimize and expand commercial whaling in the 21st century. Such threats are beneath the dignity of a great nation of Japan.”
  <p></p>
Respected international panels of independent legal experts have found the whaling currently conducted by Japan – which is killing some 1,400 whales this year in North Pacific and Antarctic waters -- to be illegal.
  <p></p>
Many argue that the 1946 Convention, which was conceived to conserve whales and regulate whaling, should reflect the new global consensus to promote the conservation of whales. “The range of threats to whales has expanded far beyond what the original signatories to the Convention could have foreseen.  Given these grave threats, the IWC must emerge from the London meeting with a clearer and reinforced mandate for whale conservation as opposed to whaling,” Ramage said.
