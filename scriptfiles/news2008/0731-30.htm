TARRYTOWN, New York - July 31 - The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has granted Riverkeeper a hearing on three of the five contentions in its petition challenging Indian Point’s relicensing application.  Riverkeeper filed its Petition to Intervene against Indian Point on November 30, 2007, joined by the State of New York, Westchester County, the Attorney General of Connecticut and other New York municipalities and local activist groups.  Contentions on leaking spent fuel pools, metal fatigue and flow accelerated corrosion of critical reactor systems were accepted by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. Contentions addressing Indian Point’s impact on Hudson River fish populations, and Entergy’s inadequate severe accident analysis were rejected. 
<p></p> “Riverkeeper has won the first round in our hard fought battle to deny the relicensing of Indian Point. We commend the NRC judges for recognizing that Riverkeeper has raised important safety and environmental issues; however, we absolutely disagree with their decision to reject two of our contentions. Each and every one of our contentions is critical and deserves a public hearing. Riverkeeper is looking forward to arguing its case against Indian Point in a formal hearing before the NRC,” said Hudson Riverkeeper and President Alex Matthiessen.
