<p>NEW YORK - January 23 - As the country awaits state  high court decisions in marriage cases brought by couples in <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/connecticut.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/california.php">California</a>, and <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/iowa.php">Iowa</a>; the <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/new_jersey.php">New Jersey</a> legislature prepares to deal with the reality that <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_informed/marriage_basics/marriage_v_other.php">civil  unions don't work</a>; and the <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_involved/freedom_to_marry_week_2008.php">11th  Annual Freedom to Marry Week</a> (Feb. 10-16) approaches, Nobel Laureate Al  Gore has added his voice in support of ending same-sex couples' exclusion from  marriage.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In a <a href="http://current.com/items/88817757_gay_men_and_women_should_have_the_same_rights">personal  video</a> posted on Current TV January 17, shortly before Martin Luther King,  Jr. Day, Al Gore spoke out in favor of the freedom to marry. &nbsp;The former vice president stated: “I think  that gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and  women, to make contracts, to have hospital visiting rights, to join together in  marriage, and I don’t understand why it is considered by some people to be a  threat to heterosexual marriage to allow it by gays and lesbians.”<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  In response to Gore’s unequivocal and heartfelt statement  making the case for marriage equality, Evan Wolfson, founder of <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/about_us.php">Freedom to Marry</a> and  author of <em><a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_informed/marriage_basics/why_marriage_matters.php">Why  Marriage Matters: America, Equality, and Gay People's Right to Marry</a> </em>(Simon  &amp; Schuster 2004), said, "Al Gore, a true world leader, explains it  perfectly.&nbsp; The freedom to marry is  about protecting all families and promoting loyalty and love and commitment. As  on so many crucial questions, Gore gets it right, and shows what leadership  really means."</p>
