BOSTON - June 27 - In response to yesterday’s decision by the Federal Communications Commission to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on product integration in television programming, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood has issued the following statement:
<p></p>
 

“We are pleased that the FCC has begun to respond to the concerns of parents and advocates about the erosion of clear boundaries between programming and advertising.  The rise of product placement and product integration is turning television shows – including those watched by millions of children – into program-length infomercials.  As part of this new rulemaking process, it is essential that the FCC extend existing prohibitions on product placement in children’s programming to include programs watched by large numbers of children.  We also support new rules that would require real time disclosure of embedded advertising in programs for adults so viewers can better understand when they are being targeted by marketers.  We look forward to working with FCC on this important process.”

 <p></p>

 <i>The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is a national coalition of health care professionals, educators, advocacy groups and concerned parents who counter the harmful effects of marketing to children through action, advocacy, education, research, and collaboration among organizations and individuals who care about children.  CCFC supports the rights of children to grow up – and the rights of parents to raise them – without being undermined by rampant commercialism.
