WASHINGTON - July 23 - When House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) and a delegation of ten House Republicans visited the North Slope of Alaska last week to push for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they never set foot in the Arctic Refuge. Despite the fact that they failed to see for themselves the Refuge’s pristine Arctic ecosystem – home to more than 200 species of wildlife – the group feels newly emboldened to spread lies about one or our nation’s last untouched wilderness places, said Cindy Shogan, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League.

 
 <P></P>

“The trip was a sham, pure and simple. Not only did the group never set foot in the Arctic Refuge, but Rep. Boehner didn’t even have the courtesy to respond to a request to meet with the Gwich’in people, who regard the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge as the ‘sacred place where life begins.’ Boehner has accepted more than $600,000 in campaign contributions from the energy sector over the course of his career. This is obviously his way of saying thank you to Big Oil.

 
 <P></P>

Drilling in the Arctic Refuge will have no effect on today’s high gas prices. And the devastation will be irreversible. Any claims that drilling won’t harm the Arctic environment are patently untrue. Just two years ago, British Petroleum spilled 200,000 gallons of crude oil across the North Slope, with another spill reported in the Alpine oil field just this past May. We must demand that the Republican leadership stop promulgating their lies and work toward real solutions for our energy crisis.

 
 <P></P>

The bill being introduced today is nothing more than a grab-bag for Big Oil. Boehner and his oily cronies are only interested in continuing our addiction to oil. We must stand up and declare our independence from Big Oil – and work together to develop real solutions that will ultimately reduce gas prices, end our addiction to oil and keep the strongest protections for the Arctic Refuge and all of America’s special places.”
