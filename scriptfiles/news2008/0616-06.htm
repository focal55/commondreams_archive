WASHINGTON, DC - June 16 - The nation’s leading voice for the national parks, the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association, today announced it is launching a new website, <a href="http://www.doyourpartparks.org/" target="_new">Do Your Part for Climate Friendly Parks</a>, which empowers national park visitors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help national parks nationwide become leaders in combating global warming.
<P></P>
"The nearly 300 million people who visit America’s national parks annually could be a tremendous force in combating global warming," said National Parks Conservation Association Clean Air and Climate Programs Director Mark Wenzler. "We are giving park visitors a tool to make a difference by cutting global warming pollution and helping to protect the national parks they love."
<P></P>
Developed in concert with the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/climatefriendlyparks" target="_new">National Park Service’s Climate Friendly Parks</a> program, the website,  <a href="http://www.doyourpartparks.org" target="_new">http://www.doyourpartparks.org</a>, encourages national park visitors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and thereby help to protect America’s national parks from the effects of global warming. Visitors choose from a drop-down list of 15 national parks, create a personal profile, and pledge to take climate-friendly actions that would then "benefit" that individual national park.
<P></P>
According to the website, if only five percent of national park visitors substituted 10 percent of their current electricity use with greener sources of power, they would save 11 billion lbs. of CO2 per year.
<P></P>
The 15 national parks listed on the website are among the 40 parks nationwide that have joined the Park Service’s Climate Friendly Parks program and committed to taking on-the-ground action to address global warming, including working to achieve maximum energy efficiency in park buildings and expanding park shuttle systems. Participating parks featured on the website include <a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis" target="_new">Apostle Islands</a>, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/glac" target="_new">Glacier</a>,<a href="http://www.nps.gov/zion"> Zion</a>, and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/wotr" target="_new">Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts</a>, among others.
<P></P>
Climate Friendly Parks earned their distinction by developing a baseline emissions inventory, setting an emissions reduction target and defining a comprehensive set of planned climate-friendly actions, including recycling programs, using energy-efficient products, using biodiesel in park vehicles, and helping educate the public with environmental outreach programs.
<P></P>
In 2007, the National Parks Conservation Association published <em><a href="http://www.npca.org/globalwarming/" target="_new">Unnatural Disaster</a></em>, a report about the ongoing and forecasted effects of global warming in national parks nationwide, from increased flooding and fires to the loss of plants and animals. Glaciers in the national parks of Alaska as well as North Cascades and Mount Rainier National Parks will continue to disappear; Joshua trees will no longer exist at Joshua Tree National Park; and a rising sea will drown Everglades National Park and portions of historic sites such as Colonial National Historical Park, site of the first permanent English settlement at Jamestown. In its report, NPCA offered recommended actions for federal, state, and local governments, and individuals, to slow, and in some cases, halt the damage from global warming to our national parks.
<P></P>
"The <a href="http://www.doyourpartparks.org/" target="_new">Do Your Part for Climate Friendly Parks</a> website provides national park visitors with easy-to-follow opportunities to reduce our personal contributions to global warming and thus, ensure a healthier park system for our children and grandchildren," said Wenzler.<!-- #EndEditable -->
