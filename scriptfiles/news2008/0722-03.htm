WASHINGTON - July 22 -   On Thursday, July 24, the federal minimum wage will increase 
                            from $5.85 to $6.55 an hour, providing a much-needed but inadequate boost to workers and our economy. The 
                            $6.55 minimum wage will still leave workers with less buying power than they had in 1997 at the start of 
                            the longest period in history without a raise. Even after the minimum wage rises to $7.25 in July 2009, 
                            it will be far below the minimum wage of 1968, which is worth $9.86 now. The Let Justice Roll Living Wage 
                            Campaign, a nonpartisan coalition of more than 90 faith, community, labor and business organizations, has 
                            launched the “$10 in 2010” campaign to raise the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2010.</p>
                            <p>
                            “We must break the cycle of too little, too late raises,” said Rev. Steve Copley, chair of Let Justice 
                            Roll. “Men and women working full time should not have to choose between paying the rent and paying for 
                            healthcare, putting gas in their car or oil in their furnace. A job should keep you out of poverty, not 
                            keep you in it.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The $10 in 2010 campaign is beginning with a call to faith leaders across the nation to endorse a letter 
                            that will be delivered to the new Congress in January in a groundswell of support for a minimum wage that 
                            lifts people out of poverty. In combination with the faith letter, Let Justice Roll is organizing “Living 
                            Wage Days” services and community events across the nation January 10 and 11.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            “All of the faith traditions represented in our broad coalition agree that employers need to pay fair 
                            wages,” said Rev. Ron Stief, Vice Chair of Let Justice Roll. “Since 2005, we have played a leading role 
                            in raising the minimum wage in 17 states and breaking the long-term stalemate in raising the federal 
                            minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage to $10 in 2010 is the crucial next step.”
                            </p>
                            Let Justice Roll is calling for $10 in 2010 because
                            <ul>
                            <li>The minimum wage is a poverty wage instead of an anti-poverty wage.</li>
                            <li>$10 in 2010 is necessary if we are to make up the ground lost in real wages since 1968.</li>
							<li>$10 in 2010 will bring us closer to the goal of the “minimum standard of living necessary for 
                            health, efficiency and general well-being of workers” articulated by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 
                            which established the minimum wage 70 years ago.</li>
							<li>$10 in 2010 will bring us closer to the day when all workers are paid a living wage.</li> 
							<li>$10 in 2010 will strengthen the foundation under our families, communities and economy.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>“The minimum wage sets the wage floor, and we cannot build a strong economy on downwardly mobile 
                            wages and rising debt and insecurity,” said Holly Sklar, senior policy adviser for Let Justice Roll 
                            and co-author of A Just Minimum Wage: Good for Workers, Business and Our Future. “Minimum wage workers 
                            don’t put their raises into predatory lending, commodity speculation or offshore tax havens. They 
                            recycle their needed raises back into local business and the economy.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Most of the ten occupations projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to have the largest employment 
                            growth during 2006-2016, such as retail salespersons, fast food workers, home health aides and janitors, 
                            have disproportionate numbers of minimum wage workers. “Paying workers enough to live on cannot not be 
                            optional,” said Holly Sklar.
