<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 13 - Today the Constitution Project warmly welcomed the introduction of legislation by Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, that would dramatically reform the so-called "state secrets privilege." The privilege, which descends from British common-law, allows the federal government to prevent the disclosure of certain information in legal proceedings, even if no federal agency or employee is a party in the case.  Since September 11th, the executive branch has repeatedly asserted that this privilege prevents citizens from challenging federal policies - like the extraordinary rendition and torture of German citizen Khaled El-Masri and the warrantless NSA spying program - in court.
<P></P>
"The state secrets privilege has long been used to undermine the open delivery of justice that Americans expect and deserve from their courts," said Sharon Bradford Franklin, senior counsel at the Constitution Project. "Reasonable measures that will ensure sensitive information is kept private, while preserving accountability and the right to a day in court, are long overdue. Chairman Nadler's  championing of legislation that will reform this oft-misused privilege should be applauded by all who believe liberty and security are not mutually exclusive."
<P></P>
The Constitution Project's bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee previously issued a report calling for legislative reform of the privilege. The statement recognized that the government must have some ability to restrict the disclosure of sensitive information, but criticized the breadth of the assertions of the privilege, as well as the government's opposition to any review by a neutral judge.
