WASHINGTON - August 14 - WakeUpWalMart.com today, along with American Rights at Work, Change to Win, and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, jointly filed an official complaint with the Federal Election Commission. The groups filed the complaint of unlawful federal election activity against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. after a recent Wall Street Journal article reported that the company had been using mandatory meetings to discuss political issues and candidates. 
<br>
<br>In the official complaint, WakeUpWalMart.com, and its 430,000 members nationally, call on the Federal Election Commission to "immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and, if so, to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal election law."
<br>
<br>Along with the complaint, the groups will deliver more than 60,000 petitions signed by citizens who want the FEC to investigate Wal-Mart's illicit behavior.
<br>
<br>The following statement can be attributed to Meghan Scott, spokesperson for WakeUpWalMart.com.

<br>
<br>"Wal-Mart may be the world's largest retailer, and America's number one private employer, but it is not above the law. Wal-Mart has intimidated its workers and attempted to scare them into voting against a particular party and candidate, and from what workers tell us, these meetings haven't stopped.  This behavior proves that Wal-Mart is willing to go to any lengths to put profits ahead of its workers. These meetings, which left many Wal-Mart workers feeling bullied and intimidated, are not just inappropriate, they are likely in violation of federal election law and the world's largest retailer must be held accountable.
<br>
<br>"We hope the FEC will act upon our complaint and open an investigation into Wal-Mart's activities as soon as possible."
