WASHINGTON, DC - June 11 - Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey (D-CA), the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, today issued the following statement regarding a proposed privileged resolution regarding articles of impeachment against President Bush.  Woolsey is a supporter of the resolution.
<P></P>
“Five years ago, President Bush undertook a deliberate and concerted campaign to send our nation to war against Iraq.  This was not a war of necessity, but a war of choice.  President Bush manipulated the intelligence in order to convince the Congress, and the American Public, that Iraq represented a clear and present danger to our national security.  A threat so grave, we were told, that continued diplomatic efforts would lead to mushroom clouds.
<P></P>
“There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and no terrorist connections between Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda.  However, there is ample evidence to suggest that President Bush planned to invade Iraq long before Congress gave him the authorization to do so, and that he undertook a campaign to manipulate the intelligence regarding Iraq’s supposed weapons program.
<P></P>
 

“More than 4,000 brave men and women have paid for President Bush’s mistake with their lives.  And tens of thousands of others will forever bear the physical and mental wounds of war.  As a coequal branch of government the Congress owes it to each one of them, and their families, to hold those who led us to war under false pretences accountable.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
