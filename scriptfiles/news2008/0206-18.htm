<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 6 - Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder released the following statement in response to Sen. John McCain’s failure to show up to vote this evening on an economic stimulus package that promoted clean energy. The package failed by one vote:
<p></p>
“In December, John McCain <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/01/mccain_vows_to.html" target="_new">pledged to voters</a>, ‘I will clean up the planet.’ But tonight, when his presence was needed most, he didn’t show up. That is not straight talk. It is not being a friend of the environment. And it is not acceptable. If Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were able to find time to show up—and they found time—McCain could have too. This is the second time in a matter of months that McCain’s failure to vote resulted in the defeat of a clean energy package that would have grown the economy and created jobs.
