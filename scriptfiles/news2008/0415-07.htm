<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 15 -  n a dramatic development, the National Toxicology Program
(NTP) concluded that the toxic plastics chemical known as Bisphenol A (BPA)
may be linked to a number of serious reproductive and developmental problems
that are common in the US population including prostate cancer, breast
cancer, and early puberty.<p></p>
These findings by the NTP, part of the National Institutes of Health,
reversed the opinions of an earlier panel that dismissed these concerns.
Environmental Working Group (EWG) and others charged at the time that
industry contractors who deliberately misrepresented the science had
hijacked the evaluation of BPA's hazards.<p></p>
A subsequent inquiry by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee
led to the firing of Sciences International, the industry contractor hired
to conduct the review, and spurred the NTP reevaluation released today.<p></p>
'NTP's decision corrects the scientific record. It reflects a significant
body of science showing that BPA may play a larger role than previously
thought in a host of common health problems, including prostate cancer,
breast cancer, and early puberty,' said Dr. Anila Jacob, senior scientist at
EWG. ' 'The findings break new scientific ground, for the first time
validating the results of tests conducted on animals at very low doses
similar to those which people are exposed to,' added Dr. Jacob.<p></p>
Late last year EWG contacted company officials at every major formula
company and found that all manufacturers use BPA to line the metal portions
of all infant formula containers, including both liquid and powdered
varieties.<p></p>
An EWG investigation found that the smallest and hungriest babies are the
most vulnerable from exposures to BPA at levels that pose risks. Overall, 1
out of every 16 infants fed ready-to-eat liquid formula is exposed to BPA at
doses exceeding those shown to be harmful in the most sensitive laboratory
studies.
