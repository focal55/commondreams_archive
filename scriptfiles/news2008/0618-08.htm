SAN FRANCISCO - June 18 - Every year, guns kill or injure more than 100,000 Americans -- including more than 7,700 Californians, yet the federal government repeatedly fails to act to stem the tide of gun violence, according to a recent report from Legal Community Against Violence (LCAV). Because of this void in federal law, state and local governments are left to adopt policies to prevent gun-related deaths and injuries, the report concludes. <br>
<br>
“Fortunately, gun violence prevention remains a priority in the State of California, both at the state and local levels,” said Juliet Leftwich, Senior Counsel, responsible for LCAV's state and local regulatory work in California. “We are proud to work with grass roots organizations and state and local legislators on the enactment of sensible laws to safeguard California communities.” LCAV provides free legal assistance to community leaders working to promote gun violence prevention.<br>

<br>
“We make it too easy for dangerous people to obtain dangerous weapons,” said Kay Holmen, President of the CA Chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. “Gun violence is not only a public health epidemic but also a huge tax burden on local communities at a time when budgets are being slashed all over California. The average cost of treating one person for gun assault injuries is $18,400, and most gunshot victims are uninsured,” she said.<br>
<br>
LCAV and the California Chapters of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence are working together to pass ground-breaking legislation to help prevent gun violence in California. AB 2062 (DeLeon) will reduce easy access to ammunition by criminals, young people, gang members, and other persons prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition. And both organizations have co-sponsored AB 2235 (DeSaulnier), which will require all newly manufactured or imported handguns in California to be "owner-authorized," or personalized in a way that would allow them to be fired only by authorized persons, once the Attorney General determines that the handguns are available for retail sale. The bills have passed the California Assembly and will now be heard in the Senate.<br>
<br>
LCAV is a national law center formed in the wake of the 101 California Street assault weapons massacre in San Francisco. LCAV fills a unique role as the first and only lawyers' organization dedicated to reducing gun violence.

As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign, with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters, works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws, regulations and public policies.  The Brady Campaign is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence,   where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our communities.
