<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 28 - Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and the No FEAR Institute will host the annual “Whistle Blower Week in Washington, DC” on Capitol Hill. This week is dedicated to informing the American public about the men and women who hold government agencies and business accountable by reporting ethical  violations that take place. Often times these individuals are reprimanded and subject to intimidation as a result of speaking out against these injustices.
 <P></P>
"The goal of ‘Whistleblower Week in Washington’ is to educate the American public about the abuse and the retaliation occurring to whistleblowers who are protecting the public safety," stated Dr. Marsha Coleman Adebayo, President of the No Fear Coalition.
  <P></P>
“The men and woman who bravely come out and expose the injustices and violations that take place with in the federal government agencies and other institutions are the eyes and ears for the American public. These people should be able to speak out freely with no fear of unfair repercussion,” said Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. “I will continue to support legislation that protects these Americans who play a vital role in making sure Congress holds any and all federal agencies and institutions accountable for violations.”  
  <P></P>
During this week, whistleblowers from all over the nation will have a chance to give their first hand account of the injustices they experienced due to exposing violations and untruths within federal government agencies and other institutions.

"After I testified on behalf of a whistleblower--the government admittedly made a series of mistakes in my pay---and sent me to Federal prison."  Jon Grand, former EPA employee

"Because of the suppressive policies of this administration towards military personnel, the American people and even Congress, are susceptible to believing the lies of General Petraeus without having heard from the real boots on the ground. If we were listening to the troops, we would have a very different picture that the rosy one being painted for us by the Administration, and its front men."
