PHILADELPHIA - June 27 - The American Civil Liberties Union will be in a federal appeals court Monday challenging the government’s efforts to deport an Egyptian torture victim. The government claims to be relying on “diplomatic assurances” from Egypt that it will not torture him upon his return.
<p></p>
In January 2008, in the first decision of its kind, a federal district court sided with the ACLU and ordered the government to stop the deportation of Sameh Khouzam based on such secret and unreliable promises and release him under conditions of supervision. However, the Bush administration appealed this ruling, claiming that the executive branch has unfettered authority to deport Khouzam and to detain him indefinitely pending his legal proceedings.
<p></p>
Khouzam, a Christian who came to the United States in 1998 fleeing religious persecution in Egypt, was granted protection from deportation under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) in 2004 after a federal appeals court found that he would likely be tortured if sent back to Egypt.
