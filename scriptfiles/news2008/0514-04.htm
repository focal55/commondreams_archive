WASHINGTON, DC - May 14 - Four of California’s most picturesque desert treasures are now one step closer to being protected forever. Just minutes ago, members of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee overwhelming approved the Desert and Mountain Heritage Act (H.R. 3682). The bill, sponsored by Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack (R-CA), would add the North Fork of the San Jacinto River, Fuller Mill Creek, Bautista Creek, and Palm Canyon Creek to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System.</p>

<p>In response to today’s action, Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p>“These four rivers are natural treasures hiding in plain sight. As more and more people move to Riverside County we can’t afford to let these vital links to our past be swallowed up by our future. I join with Congresswoman Bono Mack’s many constituents in offering my gratitude to her for championing this legislation.</p>
<p>A Wild and Scenic River is like a time machine, a link to our past, and how we choose to treat those links offers a glimpse into our future. Our natural treasures deserve to be protected. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Wild and Scenic Rivers system, and I can think of no better way to celebrate this historic legislation than by adding these four new rivers to the system.</p>
<p>I hope Congresswoman Bono Mack will share the story of these rivers with her fellow lawmakers and tell them about the amazing constituent benefits of a Wild and Scenic River. I’m confident that these desert rivers are just the beginning of her commitment to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and I look forward to celebrating the 40th anniversary of this historic law with her and other Members of Congress later this year.”</p></blockquote>
