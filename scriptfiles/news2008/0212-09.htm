<p>Minneapolis, MN - February 12 - Common to many proposals
addressing climate change is a carbon cap - limiting and lowering global
warming emissions over time. A cap will generate a market value for
carbon allowances (permits) that could conservatively be $50 billion to
$200 billion per year at the national level. A key issue is who will
receive this value.
<P></P>
All or most of this money should be given back to consumers in the form
of a per capita dividend or rebate, argues a new policy brief by the
Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR).   "The sky belongs to all of
us and we should all share equally in the new value that's created by a
carbon cap," said ILSR senior researcher, John Bailey.
<P></P>
A cap on carbon will raise the price of energy and energy intensive
goods and services. A universal dividend will help all households absorb
and manage those cost increases. In particular, low and middle-income
households, on average, should receive back more in dividends than they
pay in higher prices for fuels and products.
<P></P>
"Using universal dividends can help hold tens of millions of households
harmless while we make the transition to a low-carbon economy under a
carbon cap," according to Bailey.   The idea of using universal
dividends should be a key component of the carbon cap discussions going
on in Congress and in various states, including Minnesota.
<P></P>
From a political perspective, universal dividends are critical. A
major stumbling block to enactment of a carbon cap will be higher prices
and that could fuel widespread resistance to what will be described as a
major new and regressive energy tax. A per capita dividend overcomes
this and will provide the time needed for energy saving technologies and
low carbon fuels to expand in the marketplace.
