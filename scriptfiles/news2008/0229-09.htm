<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 29 - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today formally rejected California’s waiver request for its landmark global warming tailpipe pollution law. Friends of the Earth West Coast Program Director Danielle Fugere responded with the following statement:

 <p></p>

“Today the Bush administration has chosen to stand with polluters instead of the planet in rejecting California's waiver request to limit greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles.  Nothing in the document released today justifies EPA’s decision—in fact, it confirms recent reports that the denial was a political decision which contradicts the professional advice of EPA scientists and staff.  The document released today highlights the threat caused by global warming and underscores the need for states to act on their own to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Friends of the Earth played a key role in authoring the California law in question and we will continue to fight on behalf of its implementation.”
