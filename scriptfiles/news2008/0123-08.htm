<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 23 - On January 19, Senator Charles Grassley filed an Amicus Curiae ("friend of the court") brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Allison Engine Co., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Sanders. The Sanders case will have far-reaching impact on the viability of America's most important whistleblower protection law: The False Claims Act.

In the Sanders case, General Motors and one of its main contractors is seeking to escape liability for defrauding the government based on a technicality. In addition to Senator Grassley, the Sanders whistleblowers, the Solicitor general of the United States and other public interest groups have filed briefs supporting the whistleblowers claims.  
<p></p>
Stephen Kohn, President of the National Whistleblower Center, issued the following statement:
<p></p>
"If the Supreme Court were to find against the whistleblowers in this case, it will open a loophole by which fraudulent companies will launder their dirty contracts through subcontractors, thereby defeating the presentment requirement."
<p></p>
"Since 1986 The False Claims Act has recovered over 20 billion dollars in taxpayer money. It is the best tool this country has with which to fight fraud, and by making a common sense decision, the court can see to it that it remains that way," Kohn added.
<p></p>
<i>Since 1988 the NWC has championed whistleblower protection. The NWC is currently supporting FBI Whistleblower Bassem Youssef, who has reported serious misconduct in the War on Terror, and the NWC is currently assisting Bunnatine Greenhouse (the former Army Corps of Engineers top contracting officer who opposed the no-bid multi billion dollar contracts awarded to Halliburton for the reconstruction of Iraq)
