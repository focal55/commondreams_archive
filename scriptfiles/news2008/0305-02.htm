<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 5 - 
On Friday March 7, a United Nations Committee that monitors the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), an international treaty ratified by the U.S. in 1994 which carries the force of law in the United States, will issue their concluding observations about the Bush Administrations compliance with the treaty. This review comes just weeks after over 120 activists and experts associated with the U.S. Human Rights Network (USHRN) went to Geneva, Switzerland to monitor the U.S. government delegation’s testimony regarding its compliance with the treaty at a hearing before the UN Committee. 

<P></P> 

While  the U.S. government delegation failed completely to address issues of structural racism that persist in the United States today, members of the Committee raised many important questions about racial discrimination in the U.S., informed in large part by the USHRN’S  in-depth, independent shadow report.  During the hearing, members of the UN Committee referenced the USHRN report in many of their questions to the U.S. delegation on issues ranging from the ongoing hardships that people displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, who are mostly African American, continue to face, to the disenfranchisement and stripping of voting rights for racial minorities in a presidential election year.
<P></P> 
 

Spokespeople affiliated with the USHRN will be available for comment at the time of the Committee’s review, including:

<li>In Geneva:<br>

<ul><li>Ajamu Baraka, Executive Director of the USHRN<br>

<em>The US Human Rights Network was formed to promote US accountability to universal human rights standards by building linkages between organizations and individuals. The Network strives to build a human rights culture in the United States that puts those directly affected by human rights violations, with a special emphasis on grassroots organizations and social movements, in a central leadership role. The Network also works towards connecting the US human rights movement with the broader US social justice movement and human rights movements around the world.
