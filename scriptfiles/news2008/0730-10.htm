CHICAGO - July 30 - Norman Solomon, (nationally syndicated columnist, activist, author of War Made Easy and Made Love Got War); and John Nichols, (journalist with The Nation Magazine, author of The Genius of Impeachment) will address Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) grassroots leaders at the 4th Annual PDA Grassroots Leadership Conference.
<p></p>
The conference will be held in Chicago, August 1- 3, at the Wyndham-O’Hare hotel. The conference will provide PDA grassroots leaders with organizing tools, a review of past accomplishments, and allow PDA grassroots leaders to meet and plan for the 2008 elections and 2009 priorities. The conference will feature a retrospective and planning plenary session led by Solomon and Nichols along with actress and activist PDA National Chair Mimi Kennedy, PDA Political Director Steve Cobble, PDA Executive Director Tim Carpenter and PDA Communications Director Laura Bonham.
<p></p>
Attendees will participate in training sessions and seminars covering high-tech organizing, cultivating State Leadership Teams, Congressional District organizing, and fundraising. PDA leaders will discuss several congressional endorsements and electoral successes, the ongoing successful Healthcare NOT Warfare campaign, and plans for “Progressive Central”—PDA’s week-long series of panels and events to take place in Denver, Colorado alongside the DNC Convention.
<p></p>
<i>Progressive Democrats of America is a grassroots PAC that works both inside the Democratic Party and outside in movements for peace and justice. Our goal: Extend the victory of Nov. 2006 into a permanent, progressive majority.
