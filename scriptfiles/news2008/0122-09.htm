<p>BOSTON - January 22 -  January 22 is the 35th anniversary of legalized abortion in the U.S.  Even as we celebrate that millions of women have been able to get the abortions they need without risk to their lives and health, we are painfully aware that millions of other women have not.  Just three years after Roe v. Wade, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being used to pay for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the woman.  As a result, women already vulnerable because of poverty and racism have been denied necessary health care and the promise of Roe.  As Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall noted, in his dissent to the Court’s 1980 decision upholding the Amendment, “[F]or women eligible for Medicaid – poor women – denial of a Medicaid-funded abortion is equivalent to denial of legal abortion altogether.  By definition, these women do not have the money to pay for an abortion themselves.”
<p></p>
“At an average of $430, the cost of a first-trimester abortion can be more than half of what a poverty-level family lives on in a month,” noted Toni Bond Leonard, Board President of the National Network of Abortion Funds and President/CEO of African American Women Evolving.  “So women have very little choice -- they have to use money needed for food, rent and other necessities to pay for abortion care.” 
<p></p>
Spearheaded by the National Network of Abortion Funds, the Hyde – 30 Years is Enough! Campaign is a national coalition of over 75 social justice organizations dedicated to abolishing this inequity and repealing the Hyde Amendment. “All women must have the power and resources to make healthy decisions about their bodies and their families; it’s a matter of dignity and justice,” said Stephanie Poggi, Executive Director of the Network.
<p></p>
As part of a multi-pronged approach that demonstrates its grassroots support across the country, the Campaign has gathered over 12,500 petition signatures calling on Congress to repeal the Hyde Amendment. Activists from the coalition will bring the petitions to Congress on January 24th and deliver their message that indeed, 30 years is enough! 
<p></p>
The Hyde - 30 Years is Enough! Coalition includes groups working on reproductive rights, health care access, social justice and human rights.  The full list of participating organizations and campaign activities can be found at <a href="http://www.hyde30years.nnaf.org/" target="_new">www.hyde30years.nnaf.org  
</a>
<p></p>
Since 1976, most states have also banned state Medicaid funding for abortion, and Congress has severely restricted abortion funding in virtually every federal program, including health programs for military personnel and their families, disabled women and women receiving care from Indian Health Services.
<p></p>
For the more than 12 million women who depend on Medicaid and other federal programs, the impact of the Hyde Amendment and state funding bans is staggering.  When Medicaid covered abortion nationally, it paid for fully one-third of all abortions.  Since the Hyde Amendment took away abortion coverage, federal Medicaid has paid for less than one percent of abortions.
<p></p>
<i>The National Network of Abortion Funds (<a href="http://www.nnaf.org%20" target="_new">www.nnaf.org </a>) is a coalition of over 100 community-based groups in 42 states that offer financial assistance to low-income women seeking abortions.  Each year, member groups of the Network raise over $2.6 million and help more than 23,000 women and girls nationwide, but we cannot meet the enormous gap created by the Hyde Amendment.  The Network provides support and training to its member Funds and advocates for a humane future where public funding of abortion – and all reproductive health care – is a reality.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
