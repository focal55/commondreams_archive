<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 19 -The Big Three Oil Boycott to
End the War against Exxon Mobil, Shell, and BP will take to the street on
Saturday, February 23, in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas by the Dallas Peace
Center and ConsumersforPeace.org as part of a two-day international action
with oil workers in Iraq and demonstrators in England, Indiana and
Washington, DC.
<P></P>
    "We are thrilled to act in Dallas, home to Exxon Mobil, in solidarity
with the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions as they protest in Basra and
elsewhere in Iraq against the occupation and the attempt by Big Oil to ram
an oil law through the Iraqi parliament that will harm the Iraqi people,"
said Hadi Jawad of the Dallas Peace Center. "It is very moving to be part
of an action that involves thousands of people who want to see Iraq
liberated from the tyranny of military occupation and Big Oil."
<P></P>
    The Dallas/Fort Worth organizers will hold a press conference at 11
a.m. at Preston Road and Royal Lane in Dallas and then hold a rally at an
Exxon Mobil station at that location and at stations at Jim Miller Rd and
I-30 in East Dallas. The protestors, some dressed as pirates, will offer
passers-by boycott cards giving guidance on alternatives to the three
boycotted gasoline brands. The demonstrations are endorsed by Code Pink of
Greater Dallas.
<P></P>
    Demonstrations in England, organized by Hands Off Iraqi Oil, will be
held in London, and 10 other locations, including Birmingham and
Manchester. Demonstrators will also gather on the 23rd at Exxon Mobil,
Shell and BP stations in Highland, Indiana.
<P></P>
    The Texas/Iraq/London/Indiana actions will follow by one day a noon
march on the Washington, D.C. office of Exxon Mobil sponsored by Oil Change
International, U.S. Labor Against the War, No War No Warming, Code Pink,
Voters for Peace, After Downing Street and Grassroots America.
<P></P>
    "Oil companies are getting 20-30% more for their oil because of
decreased Iraqi oil production and the volatility in world oil markets
because of the war," said Mr. Jawad. "It is unconscionable that they be
allowed to laugh all the way to the bank as the blood of thousands colors
the desert sands of Iraq."
<P></P>
    "Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP have immense power to stop the war," said
Nick Mottern, of ConsumersforPeace.org. "Their war profits, that we
estimate at $80 billion, must be given to those who have suffered most from
the war: the families of Iraqi, American and other coalition war dead and
wounded. We call on the Big Three to do the right thing."
