BEIRUT - June 27 - Secretary General Irene Khan called on top Lebanese officials today to reaffirm their commitment to human rights by taking concrete action, including the creation of a fully independent judicial system.
 <p></p>
In a meeting with President Michel Suleiman, Ms. Khan urged him to show leadership for human rights issues during his term in office.
  <p></p>
Ms. Khan, who also met with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, asked all three leaders to work towards the establishment of a fully independent judicial system for Lebanon as a first step towards ending impunity. She stressed the need for full and independent investigations of human rights abuses during the recent incidents of political violence.
  <p></p>
She also called on Lebanon to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture.
  <p></p>
Welcoming the initiative of the Parliament to develop a National Human Rights Plan, Ms. Khan said a widespread consultation on the project was needed.
  <p></p>
She called for more protection for the rights of foreigners in Lebanon, in particular Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and migrant workers.
 <p></p>On Saturday, Ms. Khan will receive an Honorary Doctoral Degree from the American University of Beirut, in recognition for her contribution to human rights.
