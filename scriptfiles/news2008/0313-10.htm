<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 13 - Following allegations of civilian harm caused by US artillery in northern Pakistan, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today called on the US military to fully investigate the claims and to ensure immediate amends for any injuries and deaths found.
 <P></P>
According to BBC News, at least four civilians were killed in the North Waziristan region of Pakistan when five shells were fired across the border by US-led coalition forces stationed in Afghanistan.  The US military officially stated that the operation was in response to an “imminent threat.”  Maj. Gen. Abbas, the Pakistani army spokesman, stated, “The coalition forces were firing at a group of militants when five shells landed in Pakistan, destroying a house and killing two women and two children.”  The border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan is a common battleground between US and Pakistan forces and Taliban fighters.

“Fighting insurgents in this isolated region is undeniably difficult and the US makes good faith efforts to avoid civilians,” said CIVIC’s executive director Sarah Holewinski. “But when there are accusations of civilian harm, the military has a responsibility and, frankly, an interest in finding out exactly what happened.”
  <P></P>
CIVIC noted that the US military maintains a system for compensating civilians harmed in combat operations called ‘Solatia.’ Solatia payments are symbolic and do not imply legal fault, but are available in any conflict to which the US is party.  They are an acknowledgement of unintentional harm - including death, injury and property damage - among the civilian population and aim to foster goodwill on the ground. “The steps for American forces should be the same in every single incident of civilian harm,” said Holewinski. “Do an assessment of civilian damage after combat and if harm is found, offer the families tangible recognition for their losses.”
  <P></P>
CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and helped by the warring parties involved. In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by suicide bomb. CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision.<!-- #EndEditable -->
