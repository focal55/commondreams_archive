WASHINGTON, DC - June 10 -In light of recent news reports of Rep. Laura Richardson’s (D-CA) shocking financial activities, Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), released the following statement today.
<p></p>
"Rep. Laura Richardson's (D-CA) appalling financial dealings raise serious questions about her ethics. Not only has Rep. Richardson defaulted on home loans eight times since 2004, she failed to pay a mechanic, a print shop, and an auto body shop. And those are just the debts we've read about. With a history like this, there are sure to be other unpaid bills and financial irregularities yet uncovered. What kind of responsible adult – much less elected public official - only pays her bills when she’s called out by journalists? How can Rep. Richardson effectively represent the same people she is cheating? We all know about 'deadbeat dads.' Now we have a deadbeat congresswoman."
