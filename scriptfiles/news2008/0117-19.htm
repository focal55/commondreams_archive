<p>FLORIDA - January 17 - Following a campaign led by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and nearly two-thousand parent complaints, McDonald’s has ended its controversial report card advertising in Seminole County, Florida.  Children in kindergarten through fifth-grade had been receiving their report cards in envelopes adorned with Ronald McDonald promising a free Happy Meal to students with good grades, behavior, or attendance.  CCFC was alerted to the advertising by Seminole County parent Susan Pagan.  The following is the statement of CCFC’s director Dr. Susan Linn:

 
<P></P>
This is a good day for parents and children in Seminole County and anyone who believes that corporations should not prey on children in schools.  We are pleased that McDonald’s is listening to parents all over the country who believe that report cards should not be commercialized. 

 <P></P>

In the absence of needed government regulation to protect schoolchildren from predatory companies like McDonald’s, the burden is on parents to be vigilant about exploitative marketing aimed at children.  One parent can make a difference.  There is no doubt that the Seminole County ads would have continued – and violated McDonald’s pledge to stop advertising in elementary schools – had one parent not called attention to the problem. And when that parent was joined by other parents and CCFC members, one of our nation’s largest corporations was forced to back down.  What we accomplished in Seminole County should put all marketers on notice:  advertising has no place in our nation’s schools.
<P></P>
The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood is a national coalition of health care professionals, educators, advocacy groups and concerned parents who counter the harmful effects of marketing to children through action, advocacy, education, research, and collaboration among organizations and individuals who care about children.  CCFC supports the rights of children to grow up – and the rights of parents to raise them – without being undermined by rampant commercialism.
