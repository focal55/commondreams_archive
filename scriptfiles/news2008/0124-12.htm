<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 24 - The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee 
held a hearing today on S. 1843, the "Fair Pay Restoration Act," which would 
ensure that victims of workplace discrimination receive effective remedies. The 
bill’s companion measure, H.R. 2831, passed the House of Representatives in 
July, 2007. The ACLU urges the committee to support S. 1843 in order to fix a 
recent Supreme Court decision that undermines protections against discrimination 
in compensation that have been bedrock principles of civil rights laws for 
decades. </p>
<p>Testifying at the hearing was Lilly Ledbetter, the woman at the center of 
last year’s Supreme Court decision <i>Ledbetter v. Goodyear</i>, in which the 
5-4 majority held that workers cannot sue for the later effects of past wage 
discrimination. Ms. Ledbetter was the victim of pay discrimination during her 
nearly twenty years of employment at Goodyear Tire, but the Supreme Court 
decided she did not have a valid claim because she hadn’t filed her complaint 
within 180 days of Goodyear’s initial discriminatory pay decision. Not only was 
it not immediately apparent to her when the pay discrimination began, but her 
employer kept it secret, willfully preventing her from gathering the information 
necessary to file a complaint within 180 days.</p>

<p>"The Fair Pay Restoration Act will ensure employers aren’t let off the hook 
because they’re able to keep unfair pay decisions hidden from their workers," 
said Deborah J. Vagins, ACLU Policy Counsel for Civil Rights. "Correcting the 
<i>Ledbetter </i>decision would restore Congress’ legislative intent, as well as 
the commonsense law that prevailed before the Supreme Court’s ruling. This 
legislation reaffirms a fundamental principle of our civil rights protections – 
providing justice to individuals who have suffered because of unlawful 
employment practices. Responsible employers know that discrimination hurts their 
bottom line because businesses thrive on the talent and creativity that a fairly 
treated workforce provides." </p>
<p>"This bill is a modest and logical fix to an ongoing civil rights problem," 
continued Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative 
Office. "American workers should know that they are protected from wage 
discrimination and are able to challenge such discrimination when they discover 
it. There should be no benefit to employers in keeping pay discrimination 
hidden. The ACLU thanks Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi for holding 
this hearing, and strongly urges the committee to support this legislation."</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
