<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 31 - Today, the Bush administration released a report claiming that high-speed Internet access is now available to virtually every American. According to the Associated Press, the report credits the administration for fostering "an environment in which broadband innovation and competition can flourish." Since 2001, the United States has fallen from fourth to 15th in the world in broadband penetration.
<p></p>
S. Derek Turner, research director of Free Press and author several reports criticizing failed U.S. broadband policies, made the following statement:
<p></p>
"Declaring mission accomplished won't reverse America's rapid disappearance from the ranks of world broadband leaders. Just ask the tens of millions of Americans still stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide.
<p></p>
"Americans pay far more for much slower Internet connections -- when they can get service at all -- than the rest of the world. Too many people still live in areas that cable and telecom companies refuse to serve, and many more can only purchase slow and expensive connections that can't in all seriousness be called broadband.
<p></p>
"Yet while the Bush Administration stands by and cheers over Internet connections barely faster than dial-up, countries like England and South Korea are bringing affordable and fast broadband to their citizens. Americans will be left on the sidelines as these countries reap the huge economic and social benefits of innovative technologies.
<p></p>
"What do these countries have that we don't? A national broadband policy that goes beyond empty platitudes."
