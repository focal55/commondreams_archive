June 30 - In June of 2007, conservative groups threatened to boycott Wal-Mart because it was donating money to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) organizations, and Wal-Mart quickly moved to appease them, announcing it would curb its support for GLBT groups. Now Wal-Mart has once again bent to radical right wing pressure by canceling a Planned Parenthood event that was to be held in their parking lot after the American Life League sent out a statement saying, "Now parents aren't even safe to go shopping without worrying Planned Parenthood will pressure their kids into promiscuous lifestyles that will increase their bloated birth control and abortion profits."
<p></p>
The following statement is attributed to Meghan Scott – campaign director for wakeupwalmart.com.
<p></p>
“Wal-Mart has shown their true colors in their decision to capitulate to a small group on the far right. Unfortunately, this should come as no surprise to the American people.”
<p></p>
“Wal-Mart's history reflects a clear right wing agenda, and a company that will use its enormous power to undermine the very issues the American people care about. From failing to provide decent and affordable health care to facing the largest gender discrimination lawsuit in American history to paying poverty level wages, Americans have seen Wal-Mart stand with the Republican far right again and again. Now, with Wal-Mart's latest decision to serve the radical right’s agenda, Wal-Mart has shown not only how out of touch they are, but that they openly choose to stand with right wing groups, and candidates like John McCain.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
