<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 2 - 

A record 
number of bison – over 1,100 – have been slaughtered this winter around 
Yellowstone National 
Park. The removal of nearly one-quarter of the 
park’s bison population dramatically demonstrates the need to reform the rules 
governing the last stronghold for 
America’s wild 
bison.</p><p></p><p>“Yellowstone’s bison are 
America’s bison, 
the last pure descendants of the tens of millions of bison that once thundered 
through the American landscape,” said Jamie Rappaport Clark, executive vice 
president of Defenders of Wildlife and former director of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service under the Clinton 
administration. “Yet as soon as they set foot outside of 
Yellowstone 
Park, even onto publicly owned 
national forests, they are harassed and killed. This is truly one of the worst 
examples of wildlife management in the country.”
</p><p>The recovery story of bison is both courageous and historic. 
Once numbering in the tens of millions, 
America’s vast 
herds of bison were almost wiped out in the 1800s. A remnant herd of a couple 
dozen bison made a last stand in 
Yellowstone 
Park, where they staged a comeback 
against all odds - only to be turned upon by the authorities responsible for 
their protection. Goaded by the livestock industry, the Montana Department of 
Livestock is responsible for indiscriminately slaughtering bison that venture 
outside the park in winter looking for food – with help from 
Yellowstone park rangers. </p>
<p>“Yellowstone 
Park is being treated like a zoo,” 
said Mike Leahy, director of Defenders of Wildlife’s Rocky Mountain Region. 
“Bison aren’t allowed outside the park’s borders, and those that leave the park 
in search of food are either chased back in or shot.”</p>
<p>Despite the wealth of public lands around 
Yellowstone 
Park that historically supported 
bison herds, bison are restricted to the park itself. When 
Yellowstone’s bison population exceeds an arbitrary 
population cap, federal and state agencies including the National Park Service 
undertake a massive cull to reduce the population.</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of room for bison on public lands around the 
park such as the Gallatin 
National Forest in 
Montana,” said Leahy. “The only 
reason we don’t have bison there now is that the livestock industry is calling 
all the shots and demanding that bison be kept out of this historic 
habitat.”</p>
<p>Faulty science and biased politics have led to regular winter 
roundups of bison that venture outside 
Yellowstone 
Park. They are killed by and at the 
request of the Montana Division of Livestock, due to an unfounded fear that they 
might transmit a disease called brucellosis to cattle grazing on public lands. 
Yet there has never been a documented case of a bison transmitting brucellosis 
to cattle in the wild.</p>
<p>This year, the vast majority of bison exterminated for this 
reason were not even tested for brucellosis before being put to death.</p>

<p>“Ironically, Montana continues to attract tourists to the 
state and the park by marketing alluring images of bison roaming free in the 
wild as they did in days gone by,” said Leahy. “The truth is that these bison 
are by no means free. If they set foot outside the ‘Yellowstone Zoo’ they will 
be killed.” </p>
<p>Montana’s new 
Tourism and Recreation Strategic Plan, “<a href="http://travelmontana.state.mt.us/2008strategicplan/" target="_new">A Fresh Path Forward,</a>” 
recognizes the value of 
Montana’s wildlife to visitors 
from around the world.&nbsp; However, 
Montana does not.&nbsp;

<h3>Background: </h3><p>
Bison once roamed across much of North 
America. Today bison are ecologically extinct throughout most of 
their historic range, except for a few national parks and other small wildlife 
areas. Yellowstone 
National Park has the largest 
population of free-roaming plains bison (down to 3,000 from 4,700 at the 
beginning of winter), and the only herd to have remained on the landscape 
continuously</p><h6></h6><h4></h4><h3></h3>
<p>Historically, bison numbered an estimated 20-30 million. 
Unregulated shooting of bison, which culminated in mass slaughters during the 
1870s, reduced the population to in the hundreds by the late 1800s. Today, a few 
hundred thousand bison live across North America. Most 
are not pure bison but rather have been cross-bred with cattle in the past and 
are raised as livestock on ranches. Fewer than 30,000 bison are in conservation 
herds.</p><p align="center">###</p><p></p><p><em>Defenders
