<p>SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA - January 17 -  Voters in three key primary states are now able to find out what the candidates are saying about one of the most important issues of our time – nuclear weapons.

 <p></p>

As a 501( c ) 3 educational charity, the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation does not endorse candidates. However, we do believe the public deserves to be informed. To this end, we also are tracking  the candidates’ positions on nuclear issues and posting their quotes on our web site, www.wagingpeace.org , for all to see. In a few minutes, voters can learn  exactly what the candidates say about their nuclear weapons policies. And there are significant differences – even between members of the same party, like Barrack Obama and Hilary Clinton.
 <p></p>
 

Nuclear weapons pose the most immediate catastrophic threat to the planet and its people. Recent unrest in the nuclear-armed country of Pakistan has underlined the urgency of confronting the issue.
 <p></p>
 

We feature key quotes made by the Republican and Democratic candidates on five issues relating to US nuclear weapons policy:
 <p></p>
·        Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty<br>


·        Disarmament<br>


·        Missile Defense<br>


·        New Nuclear Weapons / Reliable Replacement Warhead<br>


·        Use of Nuclear Weapons<br>


  <p></p>

<p></p>
We also have results from out detailed survey of candidates for the Democratic or Republican nomination. You can read all of their <a href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/resources/surveys/2008_pres_cand/cand_survey.htm" target="_new">responses</a> at our web site
<p></p>
Here is an  easy-to-use educational tool with updated quotes from the candidates themselves.
 <p></p>
Our survey and quote web pages have been updated specifically to provide a service to voters in Nevada, South Carolina and Florida We will continue to update the site often over the next 10 months as nuclear weapons issues continue to gain prominence in the presidential campaign. Please check in with us frequently at www.wagingpeace.org to see what else the candidates are saying.
 <p></p>
If you know of a quote that does not appear in our report that you think should be included, please contact, Rick Wayman at <a href="mailto:rwayman@napf.org" target="_new">rwayman@napf.org</a> or call us at 805 965-3443. This project is meant for educational purposes only, and does not imply support for any particular candidate or political party.

The Presidential Candidates Survey and Quotes project coincides with the release of a new DVD by the Foundation called “Nuclear Weapons and the Human Future.” The  20-minute DVD, written and narrated by Foundation President David Krieger and produced by Director of Programs, Rick Wayman, gives important background on nuclear weapons and examines how the world might deal with the problems these weapons present.  The new DVD, which can be viewed on the <a href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/nuc_weapons_human_future.php?print" target="_new">web</a>, has already been snapped up for distribution in more than 100 countries by the World Federation of United Nations Associations.
