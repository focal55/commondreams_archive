May 28 - A new report on Iran's nuclear program has been forwarded to the UN Security Council, and the US corporate media is busy spinning its web.
<p></p>
After an online leak by The Institute for Science and Internation Security, US corporate media has played its part in perpetuating tensions. The leaked report, due to be released in early June, cites "no concrete evidence" of Iran's development of a nuclear bomb. Yet AP's May 26th headline stated, "Iran may be withholding info needed in nuke probe."
<p></p>
The IAEA, according to its own report, "has not detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies" on explosives.
<p></p>
Pepe Escobar talks about how the media has been "virtually unanimously saying that Iran has not come clean" on "high explosives testing". All the while, Iranian Press TV stressed that the IAEA has not detected the use of nuclear material linked to Iran's "alleged studies of weaponization".
<p></p>
While the Security Council has imposed sanctions with pressure from the United States in the past, European Union defense chief Javier Solana is looking to strike a peaceful solution, offering a new European package if Iran stops nuclear enrichment. The package would help Europe to decrease its dependence on Russian oil, and invest in Iran's oil and gas industry.
