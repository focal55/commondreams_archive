<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 7 - <font face="Arial" size="2">Two essential elements of an effective federal 
response to the foreclosure crisis are stabilizing communities hard hit by 
foreclosures and helping renters who lose their homes to foreclosure through no 
fault of their own. The Neighborhood Stabilization Act (H.R. 5818), which the 
House plans to consider today, would help address the first of these issues and 
deserves support. The House should also act quickly to address the second issue 
as part of a more comprehensive foreclosure package.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Stabilizing communities. In communities across 
the country, concentrated foreclosures have left thousands of properties vacant, 
contributing to a downward spiral of falling property values and rising crime. 
As a result, local tax bases in many areas have weakened even as the costs of 
public services such as police protection and trash collection have increased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">H.R. 5818 would give grants and loans to hard-hit 
states and localities to purchase foreclosed properties and rehabilitate them 
for resale or rental, at a federal cost of $8.4 billion. The funds would be 
distributed on the basis of actual and likely future foreclosures in communities 
where subprime loans, mortgage defaults, and mortgage delinquencies are 
prevalent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lenders would benefit from the purchase of their 
foreclosed properties but not excessively so, since buyers would purchase the 
properties at a discount from their current value. Homeowners in these 
communities who are not facing foreclosure will also benefit, as local home 
prices will fall less, and neighborhood conditions will become more stable, than 
in the absence of the bill.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At the same time, the bill seeks to ameliorate 
the nation’s severe shortage of affordable housing by requiring that a large 
share of the properties rehabilitated under the bill be affordable to low- and 
moderate-income families.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Protecting renters. More than one in four 
foreclosures affects renter households. These families have paid their rent but 
face eviction because the owners of their homes have defaulted on their 
mortgages. (Lenders typically evict renters precipitously after repossessing 
homes, rather than act as landlords.) They often cannot get their security 
deposits back, making it harder for them to find the funds to obtain other 
housing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">That calls for two remedies:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a requirement that foreclosing lenders give 
  renters a reasonable amount of time to relocate, and<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">funds to help low-income families avoid 
  homelessness. For example, an estimated 100,000 renters with incomes below 
  $15,000 reside in units that face likely foreclosure. For $300 million, each 
  such household could get $3,000 to help cover relocation expenses.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In particular need of federal protection are 
renters with federal “Section 8” housing vouchers whose homes face foreclosure. 
They are among the most vulnerable of families affected and risk losing their 
housing subsidies as well as their homes if they are unable to find another unit 
to rent with their voucher within the time period set by the voucher program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As Congress continues to refine its response to 
the foreclosure crisis, it should include measures to ameliorate the harm to 
innocent renters. For example, Rep. Michael Capuano (D-MA) has proposed a 
measure to ensure that these families be allowed to remain in their homes 
through the remaining months of their lease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Residents of hard-hit communities and renters of 
foreclosed properties represent the “collateral damage” of the foreclosure 
crisis. They are not responsible for the actions of lenders and homebuyers and 
should therefore have a strong claim on any public resources provided to help 
address the foreclosure crisis.</font><!-- #EndEditable -->
