 WASHINGTON, DC - June 3 - The American Civil Liberties Union applauds the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law for holding a much-needed oversight hearing tomorrow to examine problems with immigration detainee health care. The ACLU calls on Congress to fully investigate the failure of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide basic medical care, which has led to unnecessary suffering and death.
 <P></P>
“ICE’s failure to provide adequate medical care to detainees is deplorable and contradicts American values,” said Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. “Representative Lofgren (D-CA) and Senator Menendez (D-NJ) deserve credit for investigating ICE’s inhumane practices and for introducing the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008, legislation that would move us closer to ending these unconstitutional practices.”
  <P></P>
The Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop policies and procedures to provide ICE detainees with adequate medical care. In addition to its support of this legislation, the ACLU last June filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of detainees at the San Diego Correctional Facility who have suffered, and are at continuing risk of suffering, serious medical neglect.
  <P></P>
“Our ongoing litigation has identified numerous instances of ICE’s refusal to provide detainees with basic medical care that has resulted in excruciating pain, disfigurement, and death,” said Tom Jawetz, attorney for the ACLU National Prison Project. “It is critical that we give voice to the hundreds of thousands of people exposed each year to ICE’s fatally flawed health care system.”
  <P></P>
Since 2003 at least 83 people have died in custody or shortly after release. However, getting information or details about those who die in custody is a difficult undertaking, even for family members. Currently, ICE is not required to report deaths in its custody to anyone.
  <P></P>
In one recent case, Reverend Joseph Dantica, an 81-year-old Baptist minister from Haiti, was taken into custody at the Miami airport in 2004, even though he held a valid visa and had routinely traveled between the United States and Haiti. In 2004 he fled gang violence and applied for asylum in the U.S., but was held by ICE despite the fact that he had serious health problems, including hypertension and an inflamed prostate. He died days later.
  <P></P>
“Why did ICE incarcerate an 81-year-old Baptist minister seeking humanitarian relief? Rev. Dantica should have been released or placed in an alternative to detention program,” said Joanne Lin, ACLU Legislative Counsel. “The Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008 requires DHS to design procedures ensuring that individuals like Rev. Dantica receive priority consideration for release on parole, bond, or into a community-based secure alternative to detention program.”
