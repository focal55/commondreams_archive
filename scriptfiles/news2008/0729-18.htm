WASHINGTON - July 29 - People For the American Way Press Secretary Drew Courtney joins Brave New Films and other activists to deliver more than 125,000 petition signers urging the House Judiciary Committee to hold Karl Rove in contempt for refusing to answer its subpoena. Courtney’s statement:
<P></P>
    “For the last 25 years, People For the American Way has been fighting for the principle that the law applies equally to all people. Today, I’m proud to be joined by more than 125,000 people who want to put that theory into practice.
<P></P>
    Ordinary Americans don’t get to pick and choose which subpoenas they comply with. Neither does Karl Rove. For the last seven years the Bush Administration has flouted the law. Enough is enough.
<P></P>
    It’s time for Congress to assert its Constitutional power and provide a check on the Executive Branch. It’s time to stand up for the rule of law. And if he won’t follow the law, it’s time for Karl Rove to go to jail.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
