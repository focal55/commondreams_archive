<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 2 - 34 U.S. Senators and 73 House Members will receive
letters today informing them that federal dollars they earmarked for
organizations in their home states or districts may be unconstitutional.
The letters are signed by Lori Lipman Brown, Director of the DC-based
Secular Coalition for America and.  The Coalition reviewed 24
Congressional appropriations committee reports for fiscal year (FY) 2008
and found over 140 earmarks that may defy the Establishment Clause of the
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The $30 million in earmarks
were in the budget bill signed by President Bush on December 26, 2007.  A
copy of the letter asking members to be more vigilant in selecting groups
that receive federal funds is <a href="http://www.secular.org/news/earmarks_FY2008_letter.html" target="_new">here</a>.
<p></p>
“These earmarks may be common,” said Brown “but our research shows they
can be downright unconstitutional.”  The Coalition is sharing its findings
with the American Humanist Association and the Freedom From Religion
Foundation, the two members of the Secular Coalition for America that
engage in litigation.  The earmarked funds include colleges and
universities, youth service programs, addiction recovery programs and
community development ministries.  “Americans, regardless of their
personal religious beliefs, should be outraged that their tax dollars are
being used to convert some of their fellow citizens and to discriminate
against others. The simple fact is that taxpayer money is being used to
promote religion.”
<p></p>
Fifty-two percent of the 140 constitutionally suspect earmarks in the
study were sponsored by Republicans, 42 percent were sponsored by
Democrats and 6 percent were bi-partisan. The 10 most egregious earmarks
to religious organizations, described in their own words and with their
Congressional sponsors, are below.
