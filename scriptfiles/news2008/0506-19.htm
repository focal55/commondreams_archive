<p>NEW YORK - May 6 -  
 <i>The <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span>' May 4 Week in Review section featured <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/opinion/04precede.html?ref=opinion" title="">a discussion</a> of the state of the Iraq War with advocates of that war—-the same advocates who prompted a FAIR <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3317" title="">action alert</a> on March 17. The following letter was sent to <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> public editor Clark Hoyt, Op-Ed page editor David Shipley and Week in Review editor Sam Tanenhaus. Their contact information is listed below, as is FAIR's earlier alert.</i><br>

<br>
Dear Sirs:<br>
<br>
On March 16, the <span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span> presented a discussion of the Iraq War with "nine experts on military and foreign affairs"--all of whom supported  George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq. As FAIR asked in a March 17 Action Alert, why should the debate over the war should be restricted to those who made erroneous predictions about the invasion? FAIR supporters sent many emails to the paper, but we received no response.<br>
<br>

On May 4, the Week in Review section featured the exact same line-up of "experts," this time reacting to the fifth anniversary of George W. Bush's "Mission Accomplished" speech. Thus, <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> readers could hear from Richard Perle of the <span class="media_outlet">American Enterprise</span> Institute--who, five years ago, penned an op-ed for <span class="media_outlet">USA Today</span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-05-01-oppose_x.htm" title="">5/2/03</a>) headlined "Relax,  Celebrate  Victory." The <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> also shared the views of AEI's Danielle Pletka, who five years ago said on <span class="media_outlet">CNBC</span> (5/2/03), "We just won a war in Iraq."<br>

<br>
Over the course of the Iraq War, many commentators have pointed out that the pundits and analysts who pushed for the Iraq invasion in the first place are still dominant figures in the media debate over the war--as if the fact that they were wrong were unimportant, or even evidence of their seriousness. <br>
<br>
As the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> defined the May 4 feature, the authors were asked to "identify a significant challenge facing the American and Iraqi leadership today and to propose one specific step to help overcome that challenge." <br>
<br>
Why is the <span class="media_outlet">Times</span> only interested in hearing Iraq War advocates address those issues?<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Peter Hart<br>
Activism Director<br>
