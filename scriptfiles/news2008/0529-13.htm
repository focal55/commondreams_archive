WASHINGTON, DC - May 29 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund applauds New York Gov. David Paterson's May 14 directive to state agencies instructing them to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples that are legally performed out of state as fully valid in New York.</p>
                                
<p>During the Task Force's New York Leadership Awards on April 7, the governor spoke via video about his unwavering support for marriage equality. Paterson vowed "to push on until we bring full marriage equality to New York state" and urged "New York's civil rights leaders to recognize that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities deserve equal rights as well." He concluded with a call to "change the face of New York which will be a catalyst for change in national policy." <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGvVO6CI5H4" target="_new">Watch the video here</a>.</p> 
                                

<p align="center"><b>Statement by Rea Carey, Acting Executive Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund</b></p>
                                
<p>"Governor Paterson vowed he would 'push on until we bring full marriage equality to New York state,' and his directive to state agencies shows he is a man of his word and a true leader when it comes to standing up for all New Yorkers and standing up for full equality.</p>
                                
<p>"We applaud Governor Paterson's actions and look forward to the day when same-sex couples in New York can obtain marriage licenses within their own borders. To that end, we urge the state Senate to step up and pass a marriage equality bill — something the Assembly has already done — and something the governor says he will sign into law."</p>
