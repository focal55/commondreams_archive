MINNEAPOLIS - August 6 - Global institutions enforcing trade and finance rules have overridden fundamental
human rights, stalled international development and harmed the environment, finds
three new papers released today by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. A new
system is badly needed.<p></p>
“People around the world recognize that the current form of economic globalization is not
working,” said Alexandra Spieldoch, Director of IATP’s Trade and Global Governance Program.
“From volatile financial markets to skyrocketing oil prices, food riots and the growing
gap between rich and poor – the current system is not sustainable. The food and climate
crises compel us to re-build a new global system based on the needs of people, communities
and the environment.”<p></p>
The three papers are part of IATP’s “New Global Contract” series that highlights how rules
set at global institutions like the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and the International
Monetary Fund conflict with other basic human, economic, cultural and environmental rights,
and how a new system is needed to tackle today’s key challenges. A fairer, more sustainable
food and agriculture system must be a central component in building alternatives.<p></p>
“A Framework for Rebalancing Global Norms,” by John Foster, analyzes the role of global
trade and financial institutions in undermining human rights, and identifies strategies for
global organizing in support of a new system. “The current world climate and fuel, food and
financial crises demonstrate the need for stronger global governance through the United
Nations, and to prioritize human rights and environmental agreements over commercial law
and the WTO, if humankind is to survive,” says Foster.<p></p>
“Values in Conflict: How Trade and Finance Rules Curtail Our Rights,” by Andre du Plessis,
maps out where global trade and finance systems directly conflict with the environment, human
rights, public health and food and agriculture.<p></p>
“Promoting Human Rights and the Environment in Trade and Finance Rules,” by Maria Julia
Oliva, identifies successful strategies by civil society groups to challenge unfair multilateral
rules. It includes a list of successful case studies.<p></p>
These publications are the first in a series of initiatives by IATP to develop positive alternatives
for global governance in support of a new vision for food and agriculture.<p></p>
