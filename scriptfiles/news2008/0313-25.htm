<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 13 - Legislation introduced today may give a much-needed 
reprieve to those who have sued the government and encountered the state secrets 
privilege. The legislation, introduced by Congressman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), 
would establish appropriate limits on the use of the state secrets privilege. 
The Bush administration has misused the privilege to halt several important 
lawsuits against the government, including an ACLU case involving the 
extraordinary rendition of an innocent German citizen, Khaled El-Masri. Similar 
legislation has been introduced in the Senate by Senator Edward Kennedy 
(D-MA).</p>
<p>"This administration has abused the state secrets privilege to the point that 
it is now synonymous with ‘no comment,’" said Caroline Fredrickson, director of 
the ACLU Washington Legislative Office. "Congressman Nadler’s legislation will 
reinstate the role of the judiciary as a check against abuse of power as it will 
require a court to more closely examine the government’s national security 
claims for legitimacy. We can’t allow our president’s actions to go consistently 
unchallenged when there is evidence of government misconduct, simply because the 
government invokes ‘state secrets.’"</p>

<p>ACLU litigators have opposed the Bush administration’s illegal policies of 
warrantless surveillance, extraordinary rendition and torture in the courts. The 
administration has frequently invoked the state secrets privilege, not to 
protect sensitive evidence from disclosure, but to stymie entire lawsuits 
alleging executive misconduct – even before any requests for evidence have been 
made. The ACLU is urging Congress to exercise its constitutional authority and 
pass legislation to narrow the state secrets privilege and require courts to 
exercise independent judicial review over all government state secrets claims. 
</p>
<p>"This bill could open the courthouse doors for those who’ve suffered 
legitimate harm at the hands of our government," said Fredrickson. "People may 
not understand that many of the cases shut down by the state secrets privilege 
have a true and human cost. By tailoring the law to guard against abuse, this 
fix to the state secrets privilege could have a true and human reward. We urge 
the House Judiciary Committee to pass this legislation and to send it to the 
floor for a vote without delay."</p>
