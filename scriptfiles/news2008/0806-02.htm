August 6 - Senator John McCain is convinced the recent U.S. surge in Iraq was a success and says that the United States will prevail in the end.   He believes that the U.S. should stay the course, even if it means fighting the war for another 100 years.  In his own words, (the U.S) "will never surrender". One question remains, do Iraqis and Americans feel the same way?
<p></p>
According to a September 2006 WorldPublicOpinion poll, "79 percent of Iraqis say that the U.S. is having a negative influence on the situation in Iraq." 
<p></p>
Another poll completed by CBS News in June 2007 revealed, "that while the springtime surge in U.S. troops to Iraq is now complete, more Americans than ever are calling for U.S. forces to withdraw. Sixty-six percent say the number of U.S. troops in Iraq should be decreased, including 40 percent who want all U.S. troops removed." Despite these findings, Senator John McCain continues his presidential campaign rounds while advocating the success of the U.S. surge to win the votes of Americans. 
<p></p>
Presented in two parts, Asia Times correspondent and The Real News Network analyst, Pepe Escobar examines how the alleged success of the surge energized not only McCain but all proponents of the Iraq war, and asks whether McCain really understands the complex situation in Iraq.
