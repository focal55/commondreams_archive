WASHINGTON - August 11 - After five days of intense fighting between Russian and Georgian forces in South Ossetia, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today expressed urgent concern for the well-being of civilians and called on both sides to abide by international laws protecting those not taking part in the conflict.
 <p></p>
News agencies have reported substantial civilian casualties since Thursday's outbreak of violence in South Ossetia. Journalists on the ground have documented apartment buildings on fire with civilian trapped inside, hospitals overflowing with the severely injured and civilians fleeing for safety.  Statistics are disputed, but South Ossetians claim many hundreds, possibly thousands, of civilians have been killed with many more injured.  The United Nations Refugee Agency asserts that as many as 22,000 South Ossetians have fled their homes and crossed into North Ossetia as refugees, and several thousand more civilians are internally displaced in Georgia.

“No matter their political goals, Russian and Georgian troops have a legal obligation not to put civilians at risk," said Sarah Holewinski, CIVIC’s executive director. "Already, the human cost of their fighting is too high."
 <p></p>
In any international conflict, the laws of war oblige all warring parties to minimize harm to civilians and give civilian populations effective advanced warning of attacks. CIVIC called on Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to ensure their militaries clearly distinguish between civilians and military targets.  CIVIC also noted that civilians killed and injured should be officially recorded and provided aid, with the obligation falling to the warring parties to allow for and facilitate that aid for civilians in need.  Humanitarian agencies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, are expected in South Ossetia this week.

"Our thoughts are with the ordinary people caught up in this battle," said Holewinski.  "Civilians bear the brunt of armed conflict and we're seeing that again here. It has to stop."
 <p></p>
 <i>CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and helped by the warring parties involved.  In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by suicide bomb.  CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision. </i><!-- #EndEditable -->
