<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 24 -he United States Supreme Court announced today that it 
would not review a lower court decision preventing prison officials in Maricopa 
County, Arizona, from interfering with women prisoners’ access to timely, safe, 
and legal abortion care. 
</p><p>"As we have shown throughout this case, a pregnant woman in prison does not 
lose her right to decide to have an abortion any more than she gives up her 
right to have a child," said Brigitte Amiri, a staff attorney with the ACLU 
Reproductive Freedom Project. "It is not up to prison officials to decide 
whether a woman prisoner should carry a pregnancy to term or not." 
</p><p>At issue in the case was an unwritten Maricopa County Jail policy preventing 
women in prison from obtaining abortion care. The policy prohibited jail 
officials from transporting a prisoner for an abortion unless she first obtained 
a court order. The jail transports prisoners without a court order for all other 
necessary medical care, including prenatal care and childbirth. The jail also 
regularly transports prisoners for various non-medical reasons, including visits 
with terminally ill family members or attendance at relatives’ funerals.

</p><p>"Today’s announcement puts an end to Maricopa County prison officials’ 
blatant disregard of the law and failure to ensure that prisoners get the health 
care they need," said Alessandra Soler Meetze, Executive Director of the ACLU of 
Arizona. "It’s the end of the road for Sheriff Arpaio’s campaign against 
reproductive freedom."
</p><p>After weeks of being denied access to abortion care, a pregnant prisoner, 
represented by the ACLU, sued in May 2004 on behalf of herself and future 
prisoners seeking abortions. In August 2005, the Superior Court of Arizona, 
Maricopa County, struck down the jail’s policy, holding that it violates women’s 
reproductive rights and serves "no legitimate penological purpose." In January 
2007, the Arizona Court of Appeals upheld that decision, and in September of 
last year, the Arizona Supreme Court refused to review the case.
</p><p>ACLU briefs note that Joe Arpaio, the sheriff in charge of Maricopa County 
Jail, has "maintained the Policy throughout his tenure, consistent with his 
well-publicized stance against abortion and his ‘America’s toughest sheriff’ 
persona." Arpaio himself has admitted that under this policy, "The gal may have 
the baby by the time it gets through the court system." 
</p><p>In a similar case brought by the ACLU, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Eighth Circuit earlier this year upheld a lower court ruling allowing women 
prisoners in Missouri to obtain timely, safe, and legal abortion care. 
</p><p>Today’s case is Arpaio v. Doe, 07-839. Lawyers on the case include 
Amiri, Talcott Camp, Louise Melling, and Steven R. Shapiro of the ACLU and 
Daniel Pochoda of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona.
