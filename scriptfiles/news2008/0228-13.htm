<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 28 - President Bush spoke once again today on the House’s refusal 
to pass a Senate-approved bill updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act (FISA). He also, once again, pleaded for retroactive and prospective 
immunity for the telecommunications companies who aided in his warrantless 
wiretapping program, claiming that the suits brought against them were a 
"financial gravy train" for attorneys. </p>
<p>The following can be attributed to Timothy Sparapani, Senior Legislative 
Counsel for the ACLU:</p>
<p>"Contrary to the president’s false claim that those suing the telecoms are 
doing so because of a ‘financial gravy train," those who are seeking justice 
against the companies that sold out their privacy are not in it for the money. 
This is about the rule of law, and about insisting that corporations not be 
treated as above the law. You follow the rules, you don’t get sued. It’s as 
simple as that. Americans deserve their day in court. </p>

<p>"As for getting the help of these companies in the future, the president 
conveniently fails to mention that the companies will have immunity if they 
follow the law – namely FISA. For years, the telephone companies knowingly 
violated that law and should be held accountable.&nbsp; Because the 
administration does not want this lawlessness aired publicly, Bush is trying to 
prevent the courts from doing their job and is now goading Congress to bait them 
into aiding his administration’s cover-up. A full and public airing of the facts 
is necessary and overdue. The bottom line in all of these cases is that these 
giant companies must be held accountable for violating the law and dissuaded 
from violating the law in the future."</p>
<p>The following can be attributed Michelle Richardson, Legislative Consultant 
for the American Civil Liberties Union:</p>
<p>"The president continues to misrepresent the situation with FISA. Fear 
mongering and making unsubstantiated claims of lost intelligence does not help 
Congress reach a resolution. President Bush’s concerns can only be taken as 
seriously as his actions. Let’s not forget the facts - the Protect America Act 
expired because he flatly refused to sign a second extension. House Democrats 
should be lauded for standing strong on their principles and supporting the 
Constitution. The president can’t have it both ways. He can’t dig his heels in 
and then complain that nothing is moving. The president will have to lie in the 
bed he made while he waits for Congress to finish its job."</p>
