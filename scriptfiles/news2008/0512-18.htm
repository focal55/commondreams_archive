WASHINGTON, DC - May 12 - While millions of people around the world face severe
hunger, the handful of agribusiness corporations that dominate the
global agricultural market are seeing huge profits. One of the key
players in the global food market, Cargill, is profiled in a new report
released today by the national consumer group Food &amp; Water Watch.
The report, entitled <em>Cargill: A Corporate Threat to Food and Farming</em>,
details Cargill’s vast influence over international trade and how the
company threatens consumers, family farmers, workers, the environment,
and even entire economies around the world.</p>
<p><br> “Cargill is making
enormous profit from the international trade system that is causing all
this food instability around the world,” stated Food &amp; Water Watch
Executive Director Wenonah Hauter. “This corporate behemoth is behind
almost every aspect of the worldwide agricultural system with no
accountability for consumer health, the environment or human rights.”</p>
<p><br>
The name Cargill largely goes unnoticed by many consumers, yet their
products appear on shelves in grocery stores and in menus at fast–food
chains across the world. According to the report, Cargill has gained
control over huge swaths of the world’s agriculture processing,
storage, transport and trade, operating numerous business sectors and
divisions. Cargill produces and markets chicken and egg products to
McDonald’s in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, in addition to
Pizza Hut, Burger King, and school cafeterias in the United States.</p>
<p><br>

Cargill’s meat and poultry divisions are just a fraction of the
products they control. The company deals with oilseeds, wheat, corn,
biofuels, oils, lubricants, salts, health and pharmaceutical products
and animal feed and fertilizers –– products that have contributed to
environmental degradation both in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p><br>
The report details the numerous threats Cargill’s operations pose to
air, water and rainforests. Cargill is responsible for spilling toxic
chemicals into the San Francisco Bay, releasing hazardous compounds
into the air, and clearing South American rainforests to expand its
production of soy and palm oil.</p>
<p><br> And it is not just
controversies over global trade or environmental impacts that surround
the company. Cargill is also linked to questionable food technologies
such as irradiation, genetically modified foods, and the use of carbon
monoxide to artificially enhance the color of meat long past its
expiration date.</p>
<p><br> The report recommends action by Congress and
regulators to rein in this agribusiness giant, as well as telling
consumers how to opt out of Cargill’s model of industrial meat
production.</p>
