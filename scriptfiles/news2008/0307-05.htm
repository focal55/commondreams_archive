<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 7 -  Exxon Mobile was contracted to consult on the privatization process of Iraqi oil in early 2004.  This week the company reported another week of recording breaking profits only months after the release of allegations by Stuart Bowen, the U.S. Inspector-General, that $9 billion of Iraq's oil revenues could not be accounted for.

 
<p></p>
This is the most recent of numerous reports linking the overall cost of reconstruction operations in Iraq and U.S. corporations' misuse of funding.  Other contractors in Iraq, such as Halliburton & Blackwater have been cited in reports by the GAO and Congress for misused funds and gross misconduct.  In each case the contracts, which consume more than half the budget for military & reconstruction operations in Iraq, have been honored despite public outcry.

 <p></p>

Peace Action, in a coordinated effort with the Student Peace Action Network, will confront corporate military contractors with their culpability in the destruction of Iraq on Wednesday, March 19th, 2008, the day the U.S. occupation in Iraq will enter its 6th year. This act is part of a larger United for Peace and Justice campaign of nonviolent direct action and civil disobedience against the "Pillars of War" that sustain the illegal US occupation.
<p></p>
 

Peace Action activists from across the country will converge on the offices of war profiteers and take direct action to disrupt business as usual using nonviolent civil disobedience, protest, and satire to send a clear message to the corporations that perpetuate and profit from this illegal and  immoral war.
<p></p>
If you would like more information on Peace Action's plan please contact Barbra Bearden, Communication Associate at Peace Action's national office.  Barbra can help provide interviews with activists, access to our webcam feed, and background on this specific act of civil disobedience while it's happening.
