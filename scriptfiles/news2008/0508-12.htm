WASHINGTON, DC - May 8 - Friday, May 9 at 10am, CODEPINK Women for Peace, Amnesty International USA and members of DC's Iraqi peace community will be addressing  the disastrous effects of the Iraqi Refugee Crisis, with a special emphasis on the toll this is taking on Iraqi women and children. There will be a report back (with a photo show) by Medea Benjamin, CODEPINK cofounder, who has just returned from a trip to Syria and Jordan; as well as testimonies to life on the ground in Iraq by the award-winning Iraqi journalist Ban Adil Sarhan and the Refugee Director of Amnesty International USA.
<P></P>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Friday May 9th, 10am
<br>
<strong>WHERE:</strong> Mott House, 122 Maryland Ave NE
<P></P>
This panel/presentation is timed to coincide with Mother's Day to highlight the plight of Iraqi mothers who are suffering and trying to rebuild their lives in Iraq and abroad- the testimonies and reports of this panel will reflect MANY of their stories as well as what is being done to help them and what we can do as Americans to directly support these families. Members of the community have been invited as audience; the panel will be taking questions from the press as well.
<P></P>
"The Administration spends more in one day at war in Iraq than they have spent in 5 years on humanitarian aid to Iraqi refugees. Intentionally or not, the U.S. government has brought Iraq to its knees and we, as Americans cannot ignore it. An entire people are reduced to begging, waiting in food donation lines or selling their bodies to feed their children," says Medea Benjamin, CODEPINK cofounder who has just returned from Syria and Jordan where she met with many Iraqi refugees and the organizations working with them.
