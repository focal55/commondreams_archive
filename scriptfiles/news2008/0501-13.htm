<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 1 - A co-founder of the Out of Iraq Caucus, and the Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Representative Lynn Woolsey (D-CA) today issued the following statement on the five year anniversary of President Bush’s remarks from the U.S.S. Lincoln that major combat operations in Iraq were over.  In January 2005, Woolsey became the first Member of Congress to call for a withdrawal from Iraq, and continues to be one of the most vocal anti-war members in Congress:
<P></P>
“The President didn’t get it when he tried to play war hero on the deck of an aircraft carrier five years ago, and he still doesn’t get it today - the occupation of Iraq is an unwinnable disaster.
<P></P>
“But the American public gets it.  They see first hand the toll that this war has had on our economy here at home, and the damage that has been done to our reputation abroad.  And they know that no country should be forced to bear the costs of such a failed policy in blood and treasure that we have endured.  They have turned against this war and are demanding that those of us in Washington stand up to the President and force him to bring our troops home.
<P></P>
“That’s why across this country Americans are holding rallies and vigils to mark this occasion.  And in the Bay Area members of the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Unions are giving up a day’s pay and marching in the streets to show their opposition to the President’s continued mistake. 
<P></P>
“3,900 Americans, and tens of thousands of Iraqis, have lost their lives since the President’s announcement.  It’s time for this madness to end - it’s time to bring them home.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
