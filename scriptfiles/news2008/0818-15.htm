WASHINGTON - August 18 - The Real News analyst Eric Margolis says "The US is used to passive Russian response under Yeltsin" and the Russians checkmating the US in Georgia was a "brilliant move by Putin in preventing attempts to expand American influence in the region. Margolis says the move by the US was "stupid and calamitous", as Putin claims his military intervention was to protect the poor South Ossetians from Georgian ethnic cleansing and massacres.

Margolis says the US would have known about the Russian invasion on Georgia since it had both US and Israeli advisors and was trained and equipped by the US. "This was huge, stupid military blunder --a little version of the Iraq thing where they [US] thought everything was going to go right but everything went wrong".
<P></P>
While the US is painting Russia as the 'bad guy', Margolis says the US is shooting itself in the foot by cold-shouldering Russia. "America needs Russian cooperation for the Middle East, for Iran, for events in the Mediterranean, for oil policy, etc". As Israel is threatening to attack Iran before the end of the Bush administration, Margolis says Russia is less likely to cooperate since Putin has warned that he won't let the territory of the ex-USSR to be used to launch attacks against Iran.
