WASHINGTON - June 17 -  The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force sends its best wishes to all the same-sex couples who are getting married in California. Same-sex couples were able to begin legally marrying in that state late yesterday afternoon.
<P></P>
Statement by Rea Carey, Acting Executive Director<br>

National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
<P></P>
“I was profoundly moved as I watched coverage of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, partners for more than a half-century, get married last night in a private ceremony at San Francisco City Hall. Del and Phyllis, pioneering activists now in their 80s, were the first couple to be married in San Francisco as same-sex marriages became legal in California. Thousands of other committed couples are now following suit by holding or planning their own joyous wedding celebrations.
<P></P>
“From Sonoma to San Francisco to San Diego, these loving couples, their families and friends are participating in a poignant and time-honored tradition. This is a momentous time not only for these couples, but for California and the entire country as well.
<P></P>
“We wish each and every one of these newlyweds much joy and happiness in their marriages.”

<P></P>

The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge. <!-- #EndEditable -->
