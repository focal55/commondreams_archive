WASHINGTON - July 23 - A small manila card, tied to a tiny pair of dirty white shoes, reads "Son of woman killed in Al-Dawr. Age six months."
<p></p>These shoes and hundreds of others, representing the children killed through the U.S. occupation of Iraq, will form a dramatic display "Walk In Their Shoes" at 12 p.m. July 24 in Foley Square.
<p></p>The New York City chapter of CODEPINK Women For Peace and the American Friends Service Committee have teamed up to present the event, a visual representation of the human costs of the war to Iraqi civilians.
<p></p>"The display of children shoes is a visual representation of human loss," said Dana Balicki, CODEPINK national campaign coordinator. "It highlights the staggering costs and immense suffering this war has inflicted on the Iraqi people."
<p></p>About one million Iraqis have been killed since the U.S. occupation began. About 4,000 American soldiers have been killed and more than 30,000 seriously wounded.
<p></p>CODEPINK hopes this display will illustrate to politicians and Americans the immense devastation of this war, the tragedy of human loss and help convince them to vote against any extended action in the war and to avoid future wars through diplomacy. The nonprofit group has presented this memorial to more than 20 cities around the country. Thousands of people, including hundreds of delegates, will see the display next month at the Democratic National Convention in Denver.
<p></p>"The aftermath of war in Iraq," said Paul Lacey, presiding clerk of AFSC, "where thousands upon thousands may die or spend the rest of their lives in pain and wretchedness, will be greater unrest in the Middle East and hatred of America for generations to come."
<p></p>Local members of the Granny Peace Brigade, an activist group of women including mothers and grandmothers ages 59 to 91 opposed to the Iraq war, will also be on hand with a Congressional "phoneathon" urging passersby to call their members of Congress and urge them to promote diplomacy, not war, with Iran.
