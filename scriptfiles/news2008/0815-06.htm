August 15 - Economist and author F. William Engdahl provides an in-depth analysis of the current situation in Georgia and gives insight into some of the bigger implications surrounding the current stalemate. 
<p></p>Engdahl emphasizes two main reasons for Russia's hard line position. He discusses the U.S.'s foreign policy to position itself militarily to gain control over Russia and China through mutually benefiting arrangements with countries like the Czech Republic, Poland, the Ukraine and Georgia.
<p></p>Another major stake for everyone involved are the undeveloped reserves of oil from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan, Baku, the old oilfields of early Russia.  Engdahl states "since the end of the Cold War, there has been literally a new Cold War over oil in Central Asia."
<p></p>Engdahl claims that the U.S.' foreign policy has brought countries in Eurasia closer together while tarnishing it's own credibility and reputation.  He thinks that "the U.S. could stop this whole thing in 24 hours if the President were to announce that it was dropping the request to admit Georgia and Ukraine into N.A.T.O. and it's attempt to build missile defense in Poland, Ukraine and on the borders of Russia."
