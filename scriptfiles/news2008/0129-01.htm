<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 29 - Even a mild recession in 2008 would add 3.2 million workers to national unemployment by 2010, according to a new report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research. A severe recession, the group estimates, could make 5.8 million more workers unemployed by 2011.
<p></p>
"What We're In For: Projected Economic Impacts of the Next Recession," by John Schmitt and Dean Baker paints a grim economic picture in the event that the United States falls into a recession this year.
<p></p>
Along with a sharp rise in unemployment, a recession in 2008 would eventually result in 4.7 to 10.4 million more men, women, and children living in poverty, at least 4.2 million people losing health-insurance coverage, and a drop in the inflation-adjusted median family income of between $2,000 and $3,700 per year. The estimated effects would extend as far as 2010 or 2011, depending on the severity of the downturn.
<p></p>
"For financial markets and employers recessions are fairly short-term events," noted Schmitt. "For labor markets and workers, though, recessions have historically been long and painful."
<p></p>
The report projects the likely effects of a recession in 2008 based on the experience of the last three recessions -- the severe recession of the early 1980s, and the mild-to-moderate recessions of the early 1990s and the early 2000s.
<p></p>
If the experience of the last three recessions holds for the next economic downturn, the labor-market impacts would last far longer -- three or four years -- than the formal recession itself, which would likely last six to 24 months.
<p></p>
"If our past experience of recessions repeats itself, we may well still be feeling the effects of a recession as we enter the presidential election cycle for 2012," said Schmitt.
<p></p>
The full report and comparison point out that even once financial markets begin to recover, workers will suffer the ill effects of a recession for at least the next 3 to 4 years.<br>
