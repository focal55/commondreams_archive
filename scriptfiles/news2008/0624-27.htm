WASHINGTON - June 24 -Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA, issued the following statement in advance of the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties hearing on the Bush administration’s interrogation rules.  Vice President Dick Cheney’s Chief of Staff David Addington and former U.S. Justice Department lawyer John Yoo are expected to testify.
<P></P>
"Amnesty International applauds efforts by the House Judiciary Committee and its subcommittees to seek the truth regarding the Bush administration’s efforts to justify torture of detainees.  Administration officials’ attempts to redefine the U.S. government’s obligations under U.S. and international law through dubious legal memos with fairytale justifications has made a mockery of the values that Americans hold dear.
<P></P>
"Both Addington and Yoo were integral to the formation of the Bush administration’s war on terror policies.  Now they have an opportunity, no, a duty to the American people to provide their comprehensive knowledge of how Bush administration officials crafted and justified policies that led to torture.  
<P></P>
“This hearing is taking place on June 26, the 21st anniversary of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  It was adopted in 1984 for signature and ratification after long campaigning by Amnesty International and other organizations.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
