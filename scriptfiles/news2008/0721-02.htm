NEW YORK - July 21 -   Evelyn Ain of Autism United and Angry Parents will hold a press conference on July 21, 2008 at 2pm (EST) in NYC outside WOR Radio Studios located at 111 Broadway in Manhattan calling for the firing of San Francisco based National Conservative Radio Jock Michael Savage  and asking for a boycott by parents of children with autism of all stations carrying his signal.

They will be announcing a national protest in San Francisco California on Wednesday, July 23, 2008 with autism groups and parents across the nation outside of Savages hometown.
  <P></P>
Over 2 million children and adults have autism. 1 out of every 150 children are diagnosed with autism today.
