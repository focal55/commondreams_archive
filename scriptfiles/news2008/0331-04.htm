<p>BOSTON - March 31 - The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) is proud to announce that Morgan Spurlock – the writer/producer/director and star of the Academy Award nominated film Super Size Me – has been selected to receive the third Fred Rogers Integrity Award. The award, named in honor of the beloved host of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, is given by CCFC to the public figure whose efforts to protect children from harmful marketing best embody Fred Rogers’ long-standing commitment to nurturing the health and well-being of America’s children.  The award will be presented to Spurlock on April Third at 7:30 PM at the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston.  The event is free and open to the public.

In 2004, Spurlock's landmark documentary, Super Size Me, ignited a national discussion about fast food and helped shine a spotlight on the food industry's nefarious marketing practices.  The film, and Spurlock's follow-up Don't Eat This Book, have been instrumental in focusing attention on the childhood obesity epidemic and helping to mobilize parents, healthcare professionals, and politicians to advocate for restrictions on food marketing to children.

“With humor and charm, Super Size Me educated millions of Americans about the food industry’s role in fostering the childhood obesity epidemic,” said CCFC’s director Dr. Susan Linn.  “The film’s launch was the tipping point in popularizing the movement to protect children from junk food marketers; we continue to hear from CCFC members for whom Super Size Me was a defining moment in turning them into activists.”

 <P></P>

Spurlock has continued to focus his attention on issues of commercialism and children.   In 2007, he produced What Would Jesus Buy, a funny and moving look at the commercialization of Christmas and its impact on families.

“We are particularly pleased to give Morgan Spurlock this award because of his ability to reach young people,” added Dr. Linn.  “In his own inimitable way, he has done more than any other individual to raise their awareness about the harms of fast food marketing.  And his work continues to be a platform for addressing the problems inherent in commercializing childhood.”  

 <P></P>

“It is such an honor to receive an award like this from a group that has done so much to fight against the targeting of children by marketers and corporations,” said Spurlock.  “And it’s even cooler to get an award named after Mr. Rogers.”

 <P></P>

“We are delighted that CCFC is awarding the third Fred Rogers Integrity Award to Morgan Spurlock, who so clearly embodies their mission,” said William H. Isler, President of Family Communications, Inc.  “Joanne Rogers and I congratulate Mr. Spurlock and thank CCFC for celebrating those who support the philosophy and work of Fred Rogers.”
