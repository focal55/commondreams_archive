<!-- #BeginEditable "Body" -->GENEVA - May 5 - CARE will be working with the UN and Myanmar government authorities to assess the destruction from Tropical Cyclone Nargis, and is prepared to respond with immediate aid. Myanmar’s state-owned television and radio reported that 4,000 people died in the storm which struck Myanmar on Saturday. Nearly 3,000 more people have been listed as missing, and the final death toll could go much higher. The UN says that hundreds of thousands of people have been affected. The storm hit Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon, which has a population of five million people. The storm also tore through five districts, including some of Myanmar’s most important rice growing areas, which have a population of 24 million. With communications, including telephone lines and mobile phone networks, seriously damaged, it may take days before the full extent of the damage is known.
<p></p>
Cyclone Nargis caused serious damage to CARE’s offices in Yangon, although none of CARE’s staff in the office were hurt. However, CARE has resources in Myanmar, and is ready to help provide emergency food aid, along with emergency shelter materials and household equipment.
