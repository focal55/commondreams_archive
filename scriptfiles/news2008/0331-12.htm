<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 31 - Today, the Sunlight Foundation launched a new Web site -- <a href="http://PublicMarkup.org" target="_new">PublicMarkup.org</a> -- to invite the public to review and further shape an omnibus transparency bill the Foundation drafted.</p>
<p>"We have drafted what we think can become model transparency legislation-the Transparency In Government Act of 2008-and we now need citizens' help to refine and edit it," said Ellen Miller, co-founder and executive director of the Sunlight Foundation. "Our hope is that the final product can be used as a model for transparent government."</p>
<p>The Transparency in Government Act of 2008 updates current congressional disclosure requirements for the Internet age. It specifies technological and reporting requirements to make more information about lawmakers and their influencers, the work of Congress and of the executive branch meaningfully accessible to the public, with an emphasis on digitizing and publishing congressional information online.</p>
<p> PublicMarkup.org's blog-like layout allows users to comment on the entire bill, or on specific sections. Citizens can address such policy questions as:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li> Should Congressional Research Service Reports be public? </li>
<li> How often should political action committees (PACs) and candidates disclose their campaign finance receipts? </li>

<li> How should the Freedom of Information Act be strengthened? </li>
<li> In what ways should lobbying disclosure be expanded?</li>
</ul>
<p>"Developing this model bill via PublicMarkup.org offers Sunlight an exciting opportunity to experiment with collaborative bill-drafting online," said Ellen Miller. "It is also a chance to start a dialogue about the specifics of government-wide transparency reform."</p>
<p>The legislation debated on PublicMarkup.org is informed by ongoing collaboration with government and legislative information experts, congressional staff, non-profit organizers and bloggers who have participated in open government initiatives including the Sunlight-sponsored Open House Project, and builds upon the tradition of government reform efforts dating to the 1970s and before, including Public.Resource.org's <a href="http://resource.org/8_principles.html" target="_new">Open Government Data Principles</a>, the work of the Open Data Open Government group and countless other reform-minded citizens and advocates.</p>
<p><i>The Sunlight Foundation supports, develops and deploys new Internet technologies to make information about Congress and the federal government more accessible to the American people. Through its projects and grant-making, Sunlight serves as a catalyst to create greater political transparency and to foster more openness and accountability in government.</i><!-- #EndEditable -->
