<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 26 - Each and every year, an appalling amount of trash finds its way into our nation’s rivers and streams. It’s a fact that has communities and civic leaders all across the country teaming up with American Rivers to do something about it. As part of National River Cleanup 2008, more than 100,000 volunteers, in all 50 states, and the District of Columbia will stand up for healthy rivers, and the healthy communities they sustain, by pulling hundreds of tons of trash out of their local rivers.</p>
<p>“Last year alone, more than 600 tons of trash was removed from our rivers by National River Cleanup Volunteers,” said Rebecca Wodder, President of American Rivers. “That’s roughly equal to the weight of eight Space Shuttles.”</p>
<p>Tom’s of Maine has generously agreed to be the presenting sponsor of National River Cleanup 2008.</p>

<p>Since its inception by America Outdoors in 1992, National River Cleanup has raised public awareness about the health of our nation’s waterways and inspired people to take action for rivers. Over the years, more than 500,000 volunteers have participated in over 4,500 cleanups, covering more than 100,000 miles of waterways.</p>
<p>“With so many cleanups all across the country, odds are that there is one, right in your own backyard,” added Wodder. “And if there isn’t, there can be. Organizing a river cleanup is a tremendously rewarding experience and registering your cleanup only takes a few seconds on AmericanRivers.org.</p>
<p>Thanks to new tools on <a href="http://www.americanrivers.org/cleanup" target="_new">www.AmericanRivers.org/cleanup</a>, registering a cleanup has never been easier. This American Rivers has increased and improved the support it gives to cleanup organizers including hosting individual cleanup event webpages for all registered cleanups, volunteer recruitment tools for organizers, a Cleanup Organizer’s Handbook and the all important free trash bags. Prospective volunteers can quickly find the clean up nearest to them, sign up for the cleanup of their choice, and keep up to date with all the latest National River Cleanup news. </p>
<p>River cleanups are fun for all ages. Many environmental organizations, civic clubs, paddle-sports groups, federal and state agencies, and schools organize these events in their communities.</p>
