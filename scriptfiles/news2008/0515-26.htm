WASHINGTON, DC - May 15 -The ACLU urges members of 
Congress to support a resolution (S.J. Res 28), reversing the FCC’s Broadcast 
Cross-Ownership Rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The following can be attributed to 
Caroline Fredrickson, director of the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office: </p>
<p>“The new rules create enough 
loopholes for the merger of just about any broadcast station with any newspaper 
in any market.&nbsp; The consequences of greater media consolidation are no 
small matter.&nbsp;The concentration of TV, radio and newspaper ownership means 
fewer and less diverse opinions over the public airwaves.&nbsp; As a result, 
citizens depend on more and more homogeneous news and 
information.</p>

<p>“Our democracy requires the 
participation of an informed citizenry.&nbsp; Journalism that fails to speak 
truth to corporate and government power hurts our ability to make sound choices 
as consumers and voters.</p>
<p>“Under the pre-December FCC rules, 
media companies had been already consolidated to the point that threatened our 
marketplace and public debate.&nbsp; Six major companies control most of the 
media in the country, including the most popular sites on the Internet.&nbsp; 
Three titans, Comcast, AOL and Time Warner, own 40 percent of households with 
cable and a single company owns 1200 radio stations.&nbsp; </p>
<p>“With passage of Senator Dorgan’s 
resolution, Congress will direct the FCC to prevent further consolidation.&nbsp; 
The Murdochs of the industry argue that further consolidation will offer 
Americans more media outlets over the Internet, TV, radio and print.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But it is still a handful of corporations controlling everything we read, watch, 
listen to.&nbsp; We urge Congress to take the lead in returning the limits on 
media cross-ownership to their pre-December rules.”</p>
