WASHINGTON - August 5 - The state of Alaska has filed a lawsuit in federal district court (District of Columbia) challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act due to global warming.
<p></p>
Statement of Kassie Siegel, climate program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, and lead author of the 2005 petition to list the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act:
<p></p>
<ul>“The State of Alaska’s challenge to the protection of the polar bear is a lost cause based on discredited, industry-funded attacks on science. This case has no merit, and the Center for Biological Diversity, NRDC, and Greenpeace will be seeking to intervene in the lawsuit and have it dismissed.”</ul>
<p></p>
Statement of Andrew Wetzler, director, NRDC Endangered Species Project:
<p></p>
<ul>  “The state of Alaska's response is disappointing, but certainly no surprise. They have taken their cues from industry every step of the way.”</ul>  
<p></p>
Statement of Melanie Duchin, global warming campaigner at Greenpeace USA:
<p></p>
    <ul>“Alaska is on the front line of global warming impacts, and the polar bear is our canary in the coal mine. The state's lawsuit isn’t about the science of global warming and polar bears – it is merely doing the bidding of oil companies that want to drill for oil in sensitive polar bear habitat, without any concern for how that oil will impact the climate when it's burned.”</ul>
