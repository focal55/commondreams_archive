<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 28 - In light of increased coverage of Sen. John McCain ties to Washington lobbyists --
some of which has depicted him as a "maverick" feared by lobbyists
and representatives of special interests -- <em>Media
Matters for America </em>thought it might be helpful to provide you with
some information regarding McCain's reliance on lobbyists for campaign
support as he conducts his presidential campaign. For example: </p>



<ul><li><strong>Lobbyist
     fundraisers</strong>. Two of the co-chairmen of McCain's national
     finance committee were registered to lobby Congress as of year-end 2007
     (the latest disclosure data available), and a third previously lobbied
     Congress. Another co-chairmen is one of Florida's
     "most powerful lobbyists" (<em>St. Petersburg Times</em>, 10/1/06). McCain's
     "top fundraising official" (<em>Washington
     Post</em>, 2/22/08), one of the two co-chairmen registered to lobby
     as of year-end 2007, is the founder of a prominent Washington lobbying
     firm that has made "millions inserting earmarks into spending
     bills" (<em>Politico</em>,
     2/8/08). </li></ul>

<blockquote>

<p>McCain's reliance on lobbyist fundraisers, which
according to Public Citizen includes 59 former and current lobbyist bundlers,
follows a multi-year effort by McCain of "reaching out to K Street to
strengthen his national fundraising network" (<em>The Hill</em>, 3/8/06).</p></blockquote>



<ul><li><strong>Lobbyist
     advisers and staffers</strong>. At least 24 McCain staffers or
     advisers were either registered to lobby Congress (as of year-end 2007) or
     were previously lobbyists, according to a <em>Media
     Matters</em> review. Former and current federally registered
     lobbyists include McCain's campaign manager, deputy campaign
     manager, chief political adviser, senior policy adviser, more than half a
     dozen economic policy advisers, and numerous national and state
     co-chairmen.</li></ul>

<blockquote>

<p>A June 2007 Huffington Post report by Tom Edsall on
lobbyist staff and advisers to McCain found that while "lobbyists are
playing key roles in both Democratic and Republican bids ... all the campaigns
pale in comparison to McCain's, whose rhetoric stands in sharp contrast to his
conduct."</p></blockquote>

<p>More detailed
descriptions of <em>Media Matters</em>'
research on the myth of McCain as a lobbyist foe are below:</p>

<p><strong>Media advance myth of McCain as lobbyist foe </strong></p>

<p>The media
have long perpetuated a myth of Sen. John McCain as a straight-talking maverick
who is feared by lobbyists and representatives of special interests. <em><em>Media Matters for America</em></em> has identified
recent examples of media figures promoting just this image of McCain as hostile
to lobbyists, and feared and disliked by them. However, the reality is very
different. Even before the start of his current campaign, McCain was reportedly
"court[ing]" lobbyists in preparation for a presidential run. <em><em>The Hill</em></em> <a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fleading-the-news%2Feyeing--08-sen.-mccain-courts-k-st.-2006-03-08.html" target="_blank" title="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/eyeing--08-sen.-mccain-courts-k-st.-2006-03-08.html">reported</a>
on March 8, 2006, that "lobbyists say that McCain has been reaching out to
<a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.c-span.org%2Fguide%2Fcongress%2Fglossary%2Fkstreet.htm" target="_blank" title="http://www.c-span.org/guide/congress/glossary/kstreet.htm">K Street</a>
to strengthen his national fundraising network." <em><em>The Hill</em></em> also reported that
"prominent lobbyists" say McCain was engaged in "a quiet effort
by his political team to court inside-the-Beltway donors and fundraisers in
preparation for a possible 2008 presidential run." In a February 3, 2007, <em><em>National Journal</em></em> article (retrieved from
Nexis), Peter H. Stone and James A. Barnes reported that McCain and Mitt Romney
are "working overtime to line up influential allies on K Street who can
deliver supporters and campaign cash," citing as examples that on
"January 22, David Girard-diCarlo, the chairman of Blank Rome, which is
headquartered in Pennsylvania, escorted McCain to Pittsburgh and Harrisburg to
meet with influential donors and fundraisers. And on January 31, the senator
attended a Capitol Hill luncheon at the Monocle restaurant that drew two dozen
trade association leaders and potential allies." Stone and Barnes added
that in "2005, then-Sen. George Allen of Virginia generated a lot of enthusiasm among
GOP lobbyists. By the middle of last year, however, Allen's allure had ebbed,
and many GOP clout merchants began to see McCain as their best shot to hold the
White House in 2008." </p>

<p><a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouseforsale.org%2Findex.cfm" target="_blank">According</a> to Public Citizen, which also recently <a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A//thehill.com/leading-the-news/public-citizen-comes-to-mccains-defense-2008-02-26.html" target="_blank">defended</a> McCain on the basis of his congressional record,
McCain's campaign has more current and former lobbyist bundlers -- lobbyists
who raise money by pooling donations from themselves and others -- than any
other candidate. Further, <a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2007%2F06%2F23%2Fhuffpost-exclusive-more-_n_53456.html" target="_blank">according</a> to Huffington Post political editor and former <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> reporter Thomas Edsall,
McCain has more current and former lobbyists on staff or as advisers than any
other presidential campaign. <em><em>Media Matters </em></em>has
also found numerous McCain staffers or advisers who were registered to lobby
Congress as of year-end 2007 or were previously lobbyists. </p>

<p>Nonetheless,
the media persist in advancing the image of McCain as anti-lobbyist. In a
February 7 <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em>
<a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB120234633807649289.html" target="_blank" title="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120234633807649289.html">article</a>
(subscription required), reporters Jackie Calmes and Alex Frangos wrote that
"party maverick" McCain has had "well-publicized battles with
industry lobbyists" that "endear him to voters disgusted by the clout
of special interests in Washington -- a sentiment that runs strong in this
election year. That national reputation also meant Mr. [Mitt] Romney fell flat
in his attempts to tar the senator as a Washington
insider." Calmes and Frangos added that "in late 2006, his run-ins
with Washington
establishment types were a hindrance, not a help," and quoted Republican
strategist John Feehery asserting that McCain "is not well-beloved by the
lobbying world, to say the least, and he's used that to his advantage." On
the February 21 <a href="http://mediamatters.com/items/200802210013?f=h_latest" target="_blank">edition</a> of CBS' <em><em>The
Early Show</em></em>, host Harry Smith failed to identify McCain's
campaign manager Rick Davis as a former lobbyist, and left unchallenged his
assertion that McCain is "probably most feared by every lobbyist in this
town of Washington."
<em><em>The Washington
Times'</em> </em>Wesley Pruden, in a February 22 <a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwashingtontimes.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F20080222%2FNATION01%2F806412788%2F0%2FCULTURE%26template%3Dprintart" target="_blank">column</a>, referred to McCain as "the scourge of K Street."</p>

<p>By
contrast, a February 22 <em><em>Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2008%2F02%2F21%2FAR2008022101131.html%3Fhpid%3Dtopnews" target="_blank">article</a> by staff writers Michael D. Shear and Jeffrey H.
Birnbaum reported that "virtually every one" of McCain's
"closest advisers" "was part of the Washington lobbying culture
he has long decried." </p>

<p><strong><strong>McCain,
lobbyists, and campaign staff and advisers</strong></strong></p>

<p>In a June
23, 2007, <a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2007%2F06%2F23%2Fhuffpost-exclusive-more-_n_53456.html" target="_blank">item</a> at The Huffington Post, Edsall reported that McCain's
campaign has "11 current or former lobbyists working for or advising
McCain, at least double the number in any other [presidential] campaign."
Edsall also wrote that while "lobbyists are playing key roles in both
Democratic and Republican bids ... all the campaigns pale in comparison to
McCain's, whose rhetoric stands in sharp contrast to his conduct."
Similarly, the <em><em>Post's</em></em> Shear
and Birnbaum <a href="http://mediamatters.com/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2008%2F02%2F21%2FAR2008022101131_2.html%3Fhpid%3Dtopnews%26sid%3DST2008022200029" target="_blank">wrote</a> that "the fact that lobbyists are essentially
running his presidential campaign -- most of them as volunteers -- seems to
some people to be at odds with his anti-lobbying rhetoric."</p>

<p>Indeed, a

<p><strong><strong>McCain,
lobbyists, and his 2000 presidential campaign</strong></strong></p>

<p>McCain
also routinely associated with lobbyists during his bid for the presidency in
2000, relying on lobbyists and former lobbyists to staff and advise his
campaign and to engage in fundraising. Indeed, <em><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></em><a href="http://mediamatters.com/items/200612200013">reported</a> on February 4,
2000, that "the McCain campaign is crawling with lobbyists ... raising
money for Mr. McCain's campaign, helping him formulate policies and
representing well-heeled clients in Washington."
The <em><em>Journal</em></em> added: "Of
every $10 the McCain campaign raised last year, $1 came from the Washington area or from
political action committees, a bigger ratio than that at the Bush, Gore or
Bradley campaigns."</p>

<p>From the
February 21 edition of CBS' <em><em>The Early Show</em></em>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>SMITH: Joining us now is John McCain's campaign
manager, Rick Davis. Good morning, sir. </p>

<p>DAVIS:
Good morning, Harry. </p>

<p>SMITH: This article seems to imply, but doesn't flat
out say, that Senator McCain had an affair with Vicki Iseman. You want to
respond to that? </p>

<p>DAVIS:
Yeah, I mean, this is like the worst kind of tabloid journalism on the front
page of <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>.
And we deplored it last night. We're going to push back today. We think it's
unfair, unjust, and inaccurate, and I think <em><em>The
New York Times</em></em> has a lot to explain for.</p>

<p>You said it best, all these things are implications --
two unnamed sources and no facts in the article. If anything, they try and
drudge [sic] up all the old Keating Five stuff, 20 years old, to try and
legitimatize [sic] what's nothing more than a tabloid story. </p>

<p>SMITH: Let me ask you this, though. Because <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em> also reports in the
paper this morning that Senator McCain's staffers tried at some point to deny Miss
Iseman access to the senator's office or try to encourage the senator not to
see her. Can you deny that?</p>

<p>DAVIS:
You know, it's right out of <em><em>The New York
Times</em></em> piece. And what they did in <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> is they claim unnamed
people indicated that that was the case, but John McCain's own chief of staff,
Mark Salter, said it never was the case. So, somebody who's quoted and willing
to put themselves on the line says, "No way," but <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>, picked up by <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em> -- and by the way,
many other newspapers across the country -- print basically the fabrication
from the <em><em>Times</em></em>.</p>

<p>SMITH: All right. Maybe the most significant
allegations in this, though, is that Miss Iseman is, in fact, a lobbyist. She's
a partner in an important firm. McCain has flown on some of her clients'
private jets. And the notion here is that because she had extraordinary access
to him, that he, in fact, tried to influence legislation on her clients'
behalf. </p>

<p>DAVIS:
I agree, Harry, that that is the most outrageous thing because they show
absolutely no evidence of anything that he ever did for this lobbyist. <strong><strong>And ironically, they take the man who is probably most
feared by every lobbyist in this town of Washington</strong></strong>, the
man who's never done a favor for a lobbyist or a special interest, a man who
has authored the ethics legislation, gone after the Jack Abramoffs of the world
and really set the standard for ethical behavior in this town, and without one
shred of evidence, after talking to dozens of his former staffers, all of whom
said this was not the case, didn't name a single one of them or even reference
their interviews.</p>

<p>SMITH: Did Senator McCain directly contact Bill
Keller, the editor of <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>,
to try to get him to not run this?</p>

<p>DAVIS:
No, he never even tried to get him to not run it. He contacted Bill Keller
because their journalists, the four mentioned earlier in your article, were
running around town, spreading this gossip to try and see what they could
dredge up, and it was inappropriate and unprofessional behavior by <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. And what John McCain
called, is that that was what he was calling about. He's never tried to
influence an article, never tried to plant a question. I mean, John McCain has
spent his entire career on the back of that bus having a dialogue with
journalists. Everybody knows it. He's the most successful politician in America.
And yet, you know, they try to run a story that basically is full of innuendo
and implications.</p>

<p>SMITH: All right, we shall see. Rick Davis, thank you
very much for your time this morning.</p>

<p>DAVIS:
Thank you. </p></blockquote>

Washington Times</em></em>: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>If John McCain doesn't send a couple of cases of
Budweiser over to the New York Times, he's an ingrate. Bill Keller, this Bud's
for you. </p>

<p>Nobody on the right believes the story, printed
yesterday in Manhattan's
juiciest tabloid, that Mr. McCain carried on with a yummy blond
telecommunications lobbyist, and besides, that was eight years ago. Even if he
didn't do it, he won't do it again. Besides, the story was in the New York
Times, so it doesn't count. </p>

<p>Not only that, the lobbyist is definitely of the
female persuasion, and if you're a Republican or even a conservative you have
to be grateful for that much in Washington, circa 2008. </p>

<p>Both the senator and the lady lobbyist say there was
no romance, no hanky-panky, no lurid trysts, no attempt to trade favors for a
favor for a lobbyist's client, and that's probably good enough for nearly

everybody else. <strong><strong>The senator is, after
all, the scourge of K Street</strong></strong>, where every defeated pol
yearns to land after voters throw him out of office, to collect the big
lobbying bucks. He voted against the lady's clients on several occasions. </p>

<p>The New York Times, like the rest of the media, is
hardly interested in the morality of anyone's playing around on a mere spouse.
The culture long ago rendered philandering harmless fun, and anyone measuring
anyone against any standard as ridiculously quaint (except that you wink your
eye at a pretty girl at your own risk). The New York Times attempted to employ
the scam of the carnival midway to lure the suckers into a story about greed
and avarice but offered no evidence of greed and avarice. No letters, no
e-mail, no recording of pillow talk. But sex sells with such efficiency, as any
tabloid rewrite man could tell you, that even the accusation of something
steamy fools the unwary reader. This is not Abe Rosenthal's New York Times. </p></blockquote>

<p>From the
February 7 <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em>

<blockquote>

<p>A big test of Sen. McCain's outreach to the Republican
Party base comes today, when he will speak to the Conservative Political Action
Conference, an annual Washington gathering of the right's leading activists,
theorists and politicians. Last year Sen. McCain skipped the conference while
other Republican candidates came courting, reflecting his campaign's fear that
the conservatives would give him a hostile reception. Many conservatives took
it as a snub.</p>

<p>Now, with the nomination in sight, the McCain campaign
is showing up -- but not exactly bending to hard-core conservatives.
"There are some specific issues they consider constitutional issues --
like campaign finance [limits] -- that they just disagree with Sen.
McCain," senior adviser Charlie Black said yesterday aboard the McCain
campaign plane. But, he added, "When they understand, 'OK, there's nothing
else we can do; it's McCain versus Clinton or Obama,' the huge difference will
cause them to support McCain."</p>

<p>It's not always an easy sell. CPAC's chairman, veteran
conservative activist David Keene, recently endorsed Mr. Romney. And yesterday
morning, radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh continued to lead the post-Super
Tuesday lamentations of conservative broadcasters about a McCain nomination.
The senator can surely work with Democrats -- because he's one of them, Mr.
Limbaugh said.</p>

<p>While Sen. McCain's well-publicized battles with
industry lobbyists are unusual for a Republican lawmaker, they also endear him
to voters disgusted by the clout of special interests in Washington -- a sentiment that runs strong
in this election year. That national reputation also meant Mr. Romney fell flat
in his attempts to tar the senator as a Washington
insider. Sen. McCain "is not well-beloved by the lobbying world, to say
the least, and he's used that to his advantage," says John Feehery, a
former adviser to Republican congressional leaders.</p>

<p>When Sen. McCain's presidential campaign began taking
wing in late 2006, his run-ins with Washington
establishment types were a hindrance, not a help.</p>

<p>Current and former associates say Rick Davis, then a
top adviser and now campaign manager, assured the senator, who loathes fund
raising, that he wouldn't need to solicit many donations on the phone or attend
endless fund-raisers. Instead, money would flow from the Internet. It didn't,
in part because of Sen. McCain's unpopular stands for the Iraq war and for giving illegal
immigrants a path to citizenship. Many deep-pocketed, business-oriented
Republicans kept their wallets closed.</p>

<p>Executives and employees from the politically active
tobacco industry gave Sen. McCain's presidential campaign just $10,700 last
year -- about one-tenth of what former New
  York Mayor Rudy Giuliani got, and well below the
totals of Sens. Clinton and Obama. </p>

<p>The once front-running campaign ran deep into debt
last summer, provoking a staff shake-up and layoffs. Pundits wrote Sen.
McCain's political obituary. But the senator, more comfortable as an insurgent
than a front-runner anyway, fought back on a shoestring budget. After his third
and biggest primary victory in Florida last month, he held fund-raisers in
every big city he visited in the frenetic week of campaigning coast-to-coast
for Super Tuesday -- knowing donors would want to get on the apparent winner's
bandwagon. </p></blockquote>
