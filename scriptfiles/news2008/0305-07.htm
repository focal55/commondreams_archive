<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 5 - 
 The House approved legislation today that would strengthen the U.S. government’s capability to respond quickly to emerging crises around the world, prevent and resolve violent conflicts, and rebuild war-torn countries.

 <P></P>

The House passed by voice vote the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act (H.R. 1084), which would authorize the creation of standby groups of civilian specialists with diverse skills and the capability to rapidly deploy in a crisis to prevent weak states from collapsing or rebuild war-torn states.
<P></P>
 

“This legislation is a critical first step toward changing the way the U.S. engages the world,” explained Ann Vaughan, a lobbyist for conflict prevention with the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a 64-year-old Quaker lobby. “Many of the problems in the world today cannot be solved by military force. Problems such as economic disparity and the lack of a functioning, legitimate government can’t be solved by the military. Yet U.S. policymakers lack a corps of civilian experts to send to crisis torn areas to help countries help themselves and provide basic services to their citizens. This legislation addresses that need.”

 
<P></P>
"Today’s vote was a first step towards increasing U.S. non-military tools to respond to crisis and conflicts,” added Vaughan.
