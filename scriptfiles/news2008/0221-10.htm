<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 21 -  U.S. Senators Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl 
          are questioning the administration’s initiative to outsource federal 
          agency jobs to private companies after a government study of the plan 
          at the U.S. Forest Service revealed that it is unclear if the program 
          actually saved any money. Today, the Government Accountability Office 
          (GAO) released an audit, requested by Feingold, Kohl, and several other 
          senators, on the competitive sourcing program at the United State Forest 
          Service (USFS) which the administration billed as a way to cut down 
          on government spending. The GAO audit found that the USFS did not maintain 
          reliable data on its competitive sourcing program and that costs associated 
          with implementing the program may have exceeded the agency’s stated 
          savings. The GAO report also revealed that USFS does not have a policy 
          in place to assess how more competitions could affect the agency’s 
          capacity to react to emergencies, including wildfires. Feingold and 
          Kohl requested the original report along with Senators Byron Dorgan 
          (D-ND), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and former-Senator 
      Conrad Burns (R-MT).</p>
        <p>“The administration’s competitive sourcing plan was dubious 
          from the start, and now we see that the program may have actually increased 
          costs for American taxpayers,” Feingold said. “Congress 
          needs to take a long hard look at the administration’s competitive 
          sourcing agenda after such a damning report. I will work with my colleagues 
          in Congress to bring more accountability to the administration’s 
          questionable competitive sourcing agenda.”</p>
        <p>“It is clear from the findings of this report that administration’s 
          competitive sourcing program neither saved taxpayers their money nor 
          did it make the Forest Service more effective,” Kohl said. “The 
          time is now to take a serious look at the actual credibility and merits 
          of this hiring program as implemented by the administration, which played 
          fast and free with the facts in providing a different picture than the 
          reality.”</p>

        <p>When competitive sourcing competitions take place, federal agencies 
          identify certain jobs for potential outsourcing and a process is established 
          in which federal agencies compete against private sector companies to 
          determine which organization can perform the work for the least cost. 
          Feingold requested the GAO audit of the USFS competitive sourcing program 
          because numerous problems have been reported in recent years with the 
          implementation of competitive sourcing, particularly at the USFS.</p>
