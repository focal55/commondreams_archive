WASHINGTON - July 21 -   Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent in June, affecting everything from transportation to people's eating habits. US home prices fell 17 percent over the past year, while foreclosure filings surged 53 percent and over 71,000 properties were repossessed all in one month. In addition, the number of working-age Americans with little to no health insurance grew to over 75 million and, despite the unemployment rate remaining at 5.5 percent in June, it is expected to reach 6.0 percent in 2009.

In a recent interview Ben Bernanke, the chairman for the Federal Reserve, told The Real News Network's senior editor, Paul Jay, that "with gas and other consumer energy prices rising inflation will go higher."

These growing economic troubles have crossed the border and hit Canada's auto industry. General Motors has been forced to announce two major restructurings within a couple of months in order to cope with the downsizing of the North American industry. The CAW's economist says that despite losing "hundreds of thousands of jobs...in auto over the last three or four years already," they are "looking at downsizing the North American industry by at least a quarter over the next year or two." This means that another 100 000 workers in the major auto manufacturing sector, and several hundred thousand workers in other areas of the industry can expect to lose their jobs in the near future. Stanford also mentioned a "potential bankruptcy at one or more of the North American producers".
