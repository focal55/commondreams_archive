<p>NEW YORK - February 19 - Amnesty International said today Cuba's new leadership should seize the opportunity to make fundamental reforms to guarantee basic rights for its citizens and urged Cuba to allow the United Nations and other independent human rights bodies to visit the country.
<p></p>
The organization said the reforms should begin with the unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience.
<p></p>
"The new Cuban leadership must take advantage of this change to introduce much needed reforms to guarantee the protection of human rights," said Javier Zuñiga, special advisor to Amnesty International. "Reform must start with the unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience, the judicial review of all sentences passed after unfair trials, the abolition of the death penalty and the introduction of measures to ensure respect of fundamental freedoms and the independence of the judiciary."
<p></p>
The organization also urged the international community, and in particular the United States, to abolish policies and practices that impinge on the human rights of Cubans, such as the U.S. embargo.
<p></p>
On Monday, responding to Cuba's release of four activists whom Amnesty International has designated prisoners of conscience, the organization said it hoped their release was a sign that Cuba was moving toward greater respect for human rights.
<p></p>
The four released -- reporters Jose Ramon and Alejandro Gonzalez, dissident Omar Pernet and trade unionist Pedro Alvarez -- were among 75 prominent figures convicted of being mercenaries in the pay of the United States five years ago.
<p></p>
"The release of the four Cuban prisoners of conscience is a very positive step, but we must not forget that at least 58 people remain in prisons across Cuba for the sole reason of expressing their political views," said Kerrie Howard, deputy director of Amnesty International's Americas program.
<p></p>
"We hope that the recent release is a sign of change in Cuba, a further openness to improving respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and association," said Howard.
<p></p>
Amnesty International has adopted 58 people as prisoners of conscience – held because of their political or religious beliefs, gender, nationality or ethnicity. <!-- #EndEditable -->
