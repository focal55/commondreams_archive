WASHINGTON, DC - June 2 - The League of Women Voters today issued a call to action to the U.S. Senate, urging lawmakers to pass strong legislation that will begin to slow the harmful effects of global warming. 
<P></P>
“Global climate change is one of the most serious threats to the environment, health and economy of our nation,” said Mary G. Wilson, national president of the League of Women Voters.   “The science is clear: urgent and effective action is needed.  The public understands that global warming is already causing environmental changes that will have significant global economic and social impacts.”
<P></P>
“The Climate Security Act, sponsored by Senators Boxer, Lieberman and Warner, is a good first step toward curbing the pollution that is causing climate change,” said Wilson.  “The League believes, however, that more needs to be done, and faster.”
<P></P>
The League seeks to strengthen the legislation by ensuring that pollution reduction goals are consistent with the best scientific analyses.  The current proposal does not achieve all the reductions that will likely be needed, and advances in scientific knowledge may later indicate a need for quicker or greater reductions.  Second, the auction system should be expanded to include more emissions earlier in the process.  This will both speed compliance and increase the economic efficiency of the program.  In addition, the League supports calling for U.S. participation in international negotiations to achieve significant long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
<P></P>
“Our nation must move quickly toward a clean-energy economy, and this legislation will speed that transition,” Wilson stated.  “Global warming pollution can be reduced by using existing technologies to make power plants and factories more efficient and shift to cleaner technologies.”
<P></P>
“Cities, states and individuals are already adopting many of these solutions and proving that answers exist.  The U.S. Senate should follow suit by strengthening and passing the Climate Security Act,” concluded Wilson.
