<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 10 - Today the Bush administration released its latest forest 
planning regulations, which are as flawed as the ones overturned by a federal 
court last year. The Forest Service’s new planning rules contain almost all of 
the same problems as the agency’s 2005 regulations that were struck down less 
than a year ago in a legal victory for conservation organizations. Both the 2005 
regulatory changes and these latest changes seek to turn the strict 
forest-planning standards established in 1982 by the Reagan administration into 
virtually meaningless suggestions, making it easier for industry to log, mine, 
and drill national forests with little to no regard for impacts on wildlife and 
the land.</p><p></p>
<p>“America’s national forests are the source of much of the 
country’s water supplies, wildlife and wide open spaces, and they should be 
managed for the overall public interest. That requires a balance between 
conserving and utilizing resources, not the single-minded pursuit of economic 
profit,” said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife. “Today 
the Bush administration has unwisely come down on the side of industry by 
trotting out yet another version of national forest regulations written 
specifically for logging, mining and oil and gas 
industries.”</p>
<p>The Bush administration’s 2005 forest planning 
rules were challenged in court by Defenders of Wildlife and other conservation 
groups. In March 2007, a federal district court judge in 
San 
Francisco 
ruled that the Forest Service 
had failed to consider the environmental impacts of the far-reaching regulatory 
changes proposed in those regulations, neglected to offer the public an 
opportunity to comment on the changes, and did not adequately consider the 
impacts the changes would have on endangered species. As a result of this 
ruling, the administration was required to complete an Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS) and to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on how 
the new regulations would impact wildlife and overall environmental 
integrity.</p>
<p>The Bush 
administration’s latest proposed regulations continue to violate key 
environmental laws, forcing Defenders of Wildlife and other conservation 
organizations to consider going back to court to challenge the latest changes. 
Although the Forest Service went through the motions of analyzing the 
environmental impacts of the new rules in an EIS, it continues to assert that 
forest plans have no effect upon the environment, and its environmental review 
therefore fails to properly analyze the impacts of the new rules on wildlife and 
other environmental factors. In addition, the new regulations fly in the face of 
a federal forest management law that requires the national forests to be managed 
under binding standards to limit timber harvesting and 
other extractive uses and to ensure the protection of other resources, including 
wildlife and native plants, water quality and recreation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Bush administration is trying to reverse 
decades of progress in managing national forests without considering the impacts 
on wildlife and the environment,” said Schlickeisen. “This rule turns back the 
clock to a time when the country thought natural resources were limitless and 
conservation was barely an afterthought. We live in a very different world 
today—a much more enlightened world in which the American people understand the 
importance of protecting our dwindling resources to maintain our economy and way 
of life, for ourselves and future generations. Once again, however, the Bush 
administration is choosing to ignore the opinions of the American people, opting 
instead to bend the rules for the timber industry and oil 
companies.”</p>
