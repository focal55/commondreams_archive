<p>ANCHORAGE, ALASKA - April 8 - Today’s announcement by the Department of the Interior inviting offshore oil 
and gas drilling throughout Alaska’s fishery-rich Bristol Bay could undermine 
commercial and recreational fishing throughout the region, Defenders of Wildlife 
warned. It also puts at risk important marine mammal and migratory bird 
habitat.</p>
<p>“Through thousands of 
years of careful stewardship, Alaska’s indigenous peoples have maintained the 
healthy web of life in Bristol Bay. Now the Bush administration is encouraging 
the oil industry to submit maps showing where they want to drill offshore,” said 
Richard Charter, a consultant for Defenders of Wildlife. “This is a tragic and 
high-risk decision destined to ultimately destroy one of America’s only 
remaining sustainable marine ecosystems.”</p>
<p>The Interior Department 
will publish a “Call for Nominations” today in the Federal Register, soliciting 
oil company interest in drilling offshore in the 5.6 million acre “North 
Aleutian Basin,” including the fragile waters of Bristol Bay. Bristol Bay is 
home to a sustainable commercial fishing industry that generates, on average, at 
least $95 million per year in revenues for the region.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sport fishing and related 
tourism throughout Southwest Alaska provides an additional $90 million per year 
to local economies. Subsistence uses of Bristol Bay’s living marine resources 
also provide important services to local residents.</p>
<p>Former Interior Secretary 
James Watt first leased federal offshore drilling rights in Bristol Bay in the 
1980’s over the objections of the fishing industry. A subsequent bipartisan 
congressional drilling ban was placed on the region as a result of the 
unsuccessful cleanup of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound. 
Alaska’s Senator Ted Stevens led a successful effort to lift this annual 
congressional protection in 2003, and President Bush removed a similar executive 
offshore leasing deferral for Bristol Bay in January of 2007, leading to today’s 
approval of new drilling preparations by the Interior Department.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The final transfer of 
offshore drilling rights in Bristol Bay to the oil industry has been scheduled 
for 2011 by the Interior Department.<br>
