<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 14 - A new report by the Organic Consumers Association (<a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org" target="_new">OCA</a>)
released today found a toxic chemical linked to cancer in over 40 percent
products that call themselves &quot;natural&quot;.  Last year, Environmental Working
Group (EWG) found the carcinogen known as 1,4-dioxane in 28 percent of all
personal care products after and exhaustive study of the ingredients in over
27,000 products.
<p></p>
&quot;A chemical known to cause cancer in animals and possibly humans should not
be in shampoos, soap and other personal care products we used on our
children,&quot; said Richard Wiles, Executive Director of EWG. &quot; This ingredient
is easy to remove, but companies often don't take it out, leaving their
customers at risk. Without federal standards in place to regulate this, or
any other chemical in personal care products, consumers are left with little
choices and even less knowledge about the problem.&quot;
<p></p>
EWG¹s investigation found that 1,4-Dioxane is a potential contaminant in:
<p></p>
55% of baby bubble baths<br>
57% of baby shampoos<br>
55% of baby soaps
<p></p>
43% of body firming lotion
<br>
37% of anti-aging lotions
<br>
35% of around-eye creams
<p></p>
<i>EWG is a nonprofit research organization based in Washington, DC that uses
the power of information to protect human health and the environment.  The
group¹s research on personal care products is available online at
