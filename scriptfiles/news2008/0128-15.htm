<p>WASHINGTON - January 28 - Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder released the following statement in response to the energy package President Bush planned to discuss during his State of the Union speech tonight:

 <P></P>

“President Bush’s final-year agenda will likely cement his environmental legacy as the worst of any president in history.  The president reportedly plans to announce tonight that he wants to spend his final year in office promoting the same dirty energy sources that led to the global warming problem in the first place.  Instead of bold solutions, the president is offering false solutions—coal, oil and nuclear power—guaranteeing his lame duck status.  In the mean time, our planet moves closer to a global warming tipping point every day—a tipping point that, if passed, would spell disaster.  January 20th of next year can’t come too soon.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
