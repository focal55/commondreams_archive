<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 15 - Oil Change International, ForestEthics, and other
environmental activists will stage a protest outside the Canadian Embassy
starting at 6 p.m. during a reception for Ed Stelmach, premier of Alberta,
on his first visit to the US on Wednesday, January 16th.
<P></P>
<strong>WHO:</strong> Oil Change International, ForestEthics, Environmental and Climate
Change Activists
<br>
<strong>WHAT:</strong> Action Against Global Warming at Reception for Alberta Premier
Promoting World’s Dirtiest Fuel – Creative, Visual demonstration to call
attention to climate change causing resource extraction
<br>
<strong>WHEN:</strong> Wednesday January 16th at 6 p.m.
<br>
<strong>WHERE:</strong> Canadian Embassy, 501 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20001
<P></P>
The Canadian province of Alberta is in possession of a rare natural
resource known as the Alberta Tar Sands, which can produce a very small
amount of low-grade petroleum only after undergoing an extremely energy
intensive and wasteful process. This process produces three times as many
greenhouse gases as conventional oil production through extreme localized
degradation, and is being referred to as the most environmentally
destructive petroleum endeavor of all time. On his first visit to the U.S.
the Canadian Embassy will host a talk by Ed Stelmach promoting the
extraction and use of Alberta Tar Sands.
<P></P>
Activists will gather in a creative, energetic and visual demonstration to
send a strong message to Stelmach and the US government that nether the
U.S. or Canada, nor the planet can afford or tolerate such environmental
degradation.
<P></P>
To arrange an interview with protest organizers or for comment on the tar
sands please contact Steve Kretzmann of Oil Change International at
202-497-1033 or Liz Butler of ForestEthics at 202-487-4908
