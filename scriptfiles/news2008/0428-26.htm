<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 28 - On April 28, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indiana’s strict voter identification laws in Crawford v. Marion County Elections Board. Crawford plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of Indiana’s law that requires voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote.
<P></P>
ACORN President Maude Hurd issued the following statement in response to the case:
<P></P>
“ACORN is deeply disturbed by the chipping away of voting rights in this nation. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Indiana’s voter ID law today is one more strike against the basic right to vote. This ID law is a tool that further disenfranchises people of color and low-income Americans, citizens some partisan politicians believe will vote against them and their party.
<P></P>
What does the court’s decision say about the direction this country is headed on voting rights? It seems we are ready to turn back the clock on gains made in Civil Rights to ensure all Americans have a voice in the electorate and go back to rules that make it easier for one group to vote than it is for another.
<P></P>
ACORN, an organization that helps millions of low- to moderate-income families, wants to ensure that after eligible voters take the time to register and have been encouraged to participate fully in society, they will not be stopped at the polls. The right to vote is a basic American right that is granted based on citizenship and nothing should stand in its way. America’s full voice must be heard at the polls and only then can we say that we honor the civil rights of all citizens and practice democracy.”
<P></P>
Since 2003, ACORN has helped more than 1.8 million people to register to vote.
