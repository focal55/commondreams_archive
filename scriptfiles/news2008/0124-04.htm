<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 24 - As prepared for delivery:<P></P>Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Leahy in his effort to replace the Senate Intelligence Committee bill with the version passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. As a member of both committees, I have been deeply involved in this process, and I urge my colleagues to support the Judiciary Committee version of this legislation.
<P></P>
Indeed, I had hoped very much that the Senate would take up that bill to begin with, rather than the flawed Intelligence Committee bill. In December, I, along with thirteen other Senators, urged the Majority Leader to make the Judiciary Committee bill the base bill on the Senate floor. Unfortunately, our request was denied. So it is disappointing that we are now forced to face the uphill battle of offering the Judiciary bill as an amendment.
<P></P>
Mr. President, I’d like to lay out the reasons that the Senate should support the Judiciary Committee bill rather than the Intelligence Committee bill. One obvious reason is that the Judiciary Committee bill, unlike the Intelligence Committee bill, does not contain unjustified retroactive immunity for companies alleged to have participated in an illegal wiretapping program. I don’t want to spend a lot of time on this today because there will be an opportunity to debate this issue as the Senate’s consideration of this legislation moves forward. But I will say that having spent the last year and a half studying what happened at the NSA from 2001 to 2006, I strongly oppose immunity. Under current law, telecom companies already get immunity, as long as they follow certain requirements spelled out clearly in the law, and I see no reason for Congress to change the rules this late in the game.
<P></P>
But today I would like to focus on the other significant part of these bills, the part contained in Title I of each bill that contains sweeping new changes to the FISA law for years to come.
<P></P>
Let me start by pointing out that there are a number of similarities between Title I of the Intelligence Committee bill and Title I of the Judiciary Committee bill. Their basic structure is the same. Title I of both bills authorizes the government to conduct surveillance of individuals reasonably believed to be overseas without court approval for individual warrants. And both bills authorize the government to develop and implement procedures to govern this new type of surveillance, and provide the procedures to the FISA Court for review after they have gone into effect. These are extraordinary powers that both bills give to the executive branch, and there is no difference between these two bills in terms of the intelligence they permit the government to acquire.
<P></P>
Rather, the differences between these two bills come in the form of critically important checks and balances on those powers. The Judiciary Committee bill contains a number of important changes to improve court oversight of these broad new executive branch authorities, and to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans. The Intelligence Committee bill, on the other hand, leaves it up to the executive branch to police itself – an approach that has all too often proven to be a bad idea.
<P></P>
Mr. President, let me state it as clearly as I can: The differences between these two bills have nothing to do with our ability to combat terrorism. They have everything to do with ensuring that the executive branch follows the rule of law and doesn’t unnecessarily listen in on the private communications of Americans.
<P></P>
This debate is about whether the courts should have an independent oversight role, and what protections should apply to the communications of Americans that get swept up in these broad new surveillance powers.
<P></P>
If you believe that courts should have a meaningful oversight role with respect to government surveillance, then you should support the Judiciary bill. And if you believe that Congress should safeguard the communications of Americans here at home that could be swept up in a broad new surveillance program that is supposed to be focused on foreigners overseas, then you should support the Judiciary bill. It’s that simple.
<P></P>
That said, the Judiciary Committee bill is not perfect. More still needs to be done to protect the privacy of Americans. But that is why it should be such an easy decision to support the Judiciary Committee bill as a starting point.
<P></P>
Let me also remind my colleagues that the process by which the Judiciary Committee considered, drafted, amended and reported out its bill was an open one, allowing outside experts and the public at large the opportunity to review and comment. With regard to legislation so directly connected to the constitutional rights of Americans, the results of this open process should be accorded great weight, especially in light of the Judiciary Committee’s unique role and expertise in protecting those rights.
<P></P>
I also want to point out that several of the Administration’s criticisms of the Judiciary Committee bill have been based on technical drafting concerns. But in the version that Chairman Leahy has brought to the floor, he has made the changes necessary to address those technical concerns. So I hope we do not hear any arguments during this floor debate about these issues that have already been addressed.
<P></P>
So what, exactly, are the differences between the two bills?
<P></P>
First, the Judiciary bill gives the secret FISA court more authority to operate as an independent check on the executive branch.
<P></P>
For example, one provision in the Judiciary bill fixes an enormous problem with the Intelligence Committee bill – the complete lack of incentives for the government to target people overseas rather than people here in America. The Judiciary bill solves this problem by giving the FISA Court the discretion to limit the use of information concerning Americans when that information is obtained through procedures the FISA Court ultimately finds are not reasonably designed to target persons overseas.
<P></P>
Another provision of the Judiciary bill ensures that the FISA Court has the authority to oversee compliance with minimization procedures. Minimization procedures have been held up as the primary protection in the Intelligence Committee bill for the privacy of Americans whose communications get swept up in this new surveillance authority.
<P></P>
I don’t think current minimization procedures are strong enough to do the job. But to the extent that minimization can help protect Americans’ privacy, its implementation needs to be overseen by the Court. That means giving the Court the authority to review whether the government is complying with minimization rules and to ask for the information it needs to make that assessment. Without this provision from the Judiciary bill, the government’s dissemination and use of information on innocent, law-abiding Americans will occur without any checks and balances whatsoever. Once again, “trust us” will have to do. I believe in this case, as in so many others, “trust us” is not enough.
<P></P>
The Judiciary bill furthers other types of oversight, as well. For one thing, it requires relevant Inspectors General to conduct a complete review of the President’s illegal wiretapping program, which is long overdue.
<P></P>
And it improves congressional access to FISA Court orders. The Intelligence Committee bill requires that Congress be provided with orders, decisions and opinions of the FISA Court that include significant interpretations of law within 45 days after they are issued. That is good as far as it goes, but the Judiciary bill adds that Congress should be provided with pleadings associated with opinions that contain significant interpretations of law. At times, the Court’s opinions merely reference and approve the arguments made in the government’s pleadings, so the pleadings may be critical to understanding the reasoning behind any particular decision. It also requires that significant interpretations of law not previously provided to Congress over the past five years be provided. Congress needs to have the full story of how the law has been interpreted in the past in order to make the right decisions on what changes in the law should be made in the future.
<P></P>
The Judiciary bill also does a better job of protecting Americans from widespread warrantless wiretapping.
<P></P>
First, it provides real protection against reverse targeting. It ensures that if the government is wiretapping a foreigner overseas in order to collect the communications of the American with whom that foreign target is communicating, it has to get a court order on the American. Specifically, the Judiciary bill says that the government needs an individualized court order when a significant purpose of its surveillance is listening to an American at home. The DNI himself said that reverse targeting violates the Fourth Amendment; this provision simply codifies that principle. The administration continues to oppose this provision, and I have a simple question: “Why?” Why is it opposed to a provision that prohibits a practice that its own Director of National Intelligence says is unconstitutional?
<P></P>
The Judiciary bill also prohibits bulk collection – that is, the sweeping up of all communications between the United States and overseas. The DNI said in public testimony that this type of massive bulk collection would be permitted by the Protect America Act that is currently in effect. But he has also said that what the government is seeking to do with these authorities is something very different. It is, he said, and I am quoting him here: “surgical. A telephone number is surgical. So, if you know that number, you can select it out.” If the DNI has said he doesn’t need broader authorities, there should be no objection to this modest provision, which simply holds the DNI to his word.
<P></P>
This prohibition against bulk collection ensures that the government has some foreign intelligence interest in the communications that it is collecting, and is not just vacuuming up every last communication between Americans and their friends and business colleagues overseas. Targets do not need to be known or named individuals; they can be phone numbers, which is how the DNI has described how the government collects. And the government does not have to identify or explain its interest in the targets to the FISA Court; it merely has to make a general certification that individual targets exist.
<P></P>
The Judiciary bill also has a sunset of four years rather than six years, ensuring that Congress will reevaluate this law at least once before the end of the next presidential term. And, critically, it contains a strong statement that Congress intends for FISA to be the exclusive means by which foreign intelligence surveillance is conducted. It also closes purported statutory loopholes that the Justice Department relied on to make its tortured arguments that the congressional authorization for use of force in Afghanistan somehow authorized the President’s illegal wiretapping program. The Judiciary bill makes clear, once and for all, that the President must follow the law.
<P></P>
Mr. President, for all of these reasons, the Senate should support the Judiciary Committee’s product. Let me repeat what I said at the outset: The differences between these two bills have nothing to do with our ability to combat terrorism. They have everything to do with ensuring that the executive branch adheres to the rule of law and doesn’t unnecessarily listen in on the private communications of Americans. The fact that the administration is so strongly resisting these commonsense protections says a lot. And it ought to give pause to those who are considering opposing it. It is time for Congress to stop being an enabler when it comes to this administration’s indifference to the rule of law, and instead start being a protector of the rights and freedoms of citizens.
<P></P>
I urge my colleagues to support the Judiciary Committee bill, and I yield the floor.<!-- #EndEditable -->
