<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 15 - Rep. J. Randy Forbes (R-VA) and 31 other Representatives
could bring House Resolution 888, introduced December 18, 2007, to a floor
vote as early as this week.  H. Res. 888, “Affirming the rich spiritual
and religious history of our Nation's founding and subsequent history….”
specifically proposes an “American Religious History Week” to be taught in
public schools each May.  Lori Lipman Brown, Director of the Secular
Coalition for America, issued the following statement in anticipation of a
vote:
<P></P>
“Congressman Forbes apparently knows as much about history as pollsters
know about voters in New Hampshire.
<P></P>
“The Secular Coalition would welcome the unbiased teaching of America’s
religious history, but this resolution presents such a distorted version
of that history, real education can’t possibly be its goal.
<P></P>
“The fact is the “spiritual and religious history of our Nation's founding
and subsequent history” is rife with persecution against Catholics, Jews,
Muslims, atheists and other minorities.  The Puritans, for example, not
only burned witches at the stake, but they also tortured and hanged
Quakers.  In 19th Century Philadelphia, Catholic children in public
schools were forced to read the Protestant Bible, and their churches were
burned when they resisted.  Various groups gained political power on
explicitly Christian platforms, such as the Know Nothings’ anti-Catholic
campaign, and the Ku Klux Klan’s political and violently brutal campaigns
against Jews, Catholics, religious liberals and, of course, African
Americans.
<P></P>
“Today, military personnel who don’t identify as born again Christians are
being harassed, and students who opt out of prayers in public school are
being bullied.  All this counts as religious history, too, but it’s not in
the resolution.
<P></P>
“The “whereas” paragraphs in this resolution are dishonest: they
deliberately confuse the personal religious beliefs of our nation’s
political leaders with their public actions; they ignore the fact that our
Founders (many of whom were deists anyway) checked their religion at the
door when they wrote the Constitution.  Contrary to what Rep. Forbes would
have us think, the word ‘God’ never appears in the U.S. Constitution, and
that’s the document which governs our nation and sets the standard for
keeping religion out of government and government out of religion.
<P></P>
“Our supporters are contacting their members of Congress and asking them
to vote No on H. Res. 888.  If we don’t stop it, next thing you know
they’ll be trying to teach the Immaculate Conception in biology class.”
<P></P>
