LOS ANGELES - August 19 - Two icons of progressive political filmmaking, Michael Moore and Robert Greenwald, will appear on the groundbreaking new web series Meet The Bloggers on Friday, August 22nd.   In a special extended format, Michael Moore will appear on Meet The Bloggers to discuss his new book, Mike's Election Guide 2008, with Brave New Foundation President Robert Greenwald.  Among the central questions from Mr. Moore's book to be discussed: 'How many Democrats does it take to lose the most winnable election in American History?'
 <p></p>
"Democrats are masters of blowing it," Michael Moore argues in his book, "They blow it especially when the electorate is desperate to give it to them."  In his book, Mr. Moore gives Democrats tongue-in-cheek instructions on how to elect John McCain as well as outlining a to-do list for the first ten days of an Obama Presidency. 
 <p></p>
After the release of his film, "Fahrenheit 9/11," Mr. Moore filled stadiums to capacity in the run-up to the 2004 election. 
 <p></p>
The only show of its kind, Meet the Bloggers will also feature Mr. Moore discussing his book with a panel of bloggers.  Anyone, anywhere can participate in the discussion by logging onto the live blog that will be running throughout the show.
 <p></p>
"I am really looking forward to my chat with Michael," said Robert Greenwald, Director of Brave New Foundation, the producer of Meet The Bloggers, "This is a critical election and Michael's stinging brand of humor is just what the doctor ordered to put things in perspective.  In the age of corporate media consolidation, shows like ours are the future of free discussion of politics."
