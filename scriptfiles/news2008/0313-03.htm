<p>NEW YORK - March 13 - China sold over $55 million worth of small arms to Sudan as the violence escalated in Darfur, a new report released today finds. While other countries were decreasing their arms sales to Khartoum, China stepped in to fill the void by providing Sudan with some 90 percent of its small arms during 2004-2006. This makes China the single largest provider of small arms to Sudan.
<p></p>
The new Human Rights First report—Investing in Tragedy: China’s Money, Arms and Politics in Sudan— ties China’s arms sales to Sudan to Beijing’s goal of protecting its controlling interest in the Sudanese oil industry. Released today as part of the launch of Human Rights First’s “Made in China” campaign, the report urges China to immediately halt its arms sales to Sudan in the lead up to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. The group believes that the upcoming Olympics offer a unique and urgent opportunity to exert pressure on China to reverse its deadly course in Sudan.
<p></p>
“China has launched a PR campaign—a charm offensive—to convince the world it’s doing everything possible to stop the violence in Darfur, but the rhetoric simply doesn’t match the reality,” said Betsy Apple, director of the Crimes Against Humanity program at Human Rights First. “So long as it continues to sell massive quantities of small arms to Khartoum, the government of China has created a virtual supply line from the small arms factories in China to the Sudanese government-sponsored militias killing civilians in Darfur,” she said.
<p></p>
“A lethal cycle has developed where Sudan sells China large quantities of oil and then turns around and uses the income from its oil sales to purchase weapons from China. The people of Darfur suffer the consequences as the arms are turned against them, resulting in more death, displacement and destruction,” stated Apple.
<p></p>
As the report describes, the close relationship between China and Sudan is rooted in China’s dependence on Sudanese oil to fuel its own exponential economic growth. Sudan’s oil sales to China, in turn, have contributed substantially to Khartoum’s arms purchases. Observers on the ground in Darfur have reported seeing a range of Chinese weaponry, including grenade launchers and ammunition. Initially, China denied it was selling weapons to Sudan following the passage of the Security Council arms embargo on Darfur. But China has been forced to admit its sales continued, although Beijing now claims its arms sales to Sudan are minor and do not end up in Darfur.
<p></p>
“Chinese claims that its weapons and munitions are not reaching Darfur are simply not credible, especially given that the government of Sudan admits that it does not and will not abide by the arms embargo on Darfur,” said Apple.
<p></p>
The report puts forward a series of recommendations for concrete actions China could take to reverse its deadly course in Sudan and improve its international standing, as the Beijing Summer Olympics rapidly approach. Among them, China should:
<p></p>
· Immediately terminate arms transfers to all parties involved in the conflict in Darfur, including the Sudanese government, to ensure that the embargo imposed by Security Council resolution 1556 (2004) and expanded by Security Council resolution 1591 (2005) is fully implemented.
<p></p>
· Cease all other forms of military support to the Sudanese government, including training activities.
<p></p>
· Support the expansion of the U.N. Security Council arms embargo on Darfur to the whole of Sudan and prohibit the sale and supply of arms and related materiel to non-state armed groups located in or operating from Chad.
<p></p>
· Refrain from using its veto or threat of veto in the Security Council to impede or dilute efforts to stop mass atrocities in Sudan and elsewhere.
<p></p>
“China’s claim that it’s doing all it can to help achieve peace in Darfur is fallacious so long as it is the chief supplier of small arms to the government of Sudan. If China is serious about helping bring peace to Darfur, it must first cut off arms supplies to Sudan,” said Apple.
