 - June 27 - The intimidation and fear tactics spread by supporters of President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe has resulted in a low voter turnout giving Zimbabwe's only president his sixth term in office. The election, which UN spokeswoman Krisztina Nagy refers to as hollow and meaningless has the South African Development Community refusing to endorse today's election as free and fair.

President Mugabe's recent actions continue to draw international condemnation as United States Presidential candidate Senator. Barrack Obama feels that the United Nations needs to continue applying as much pressure as possible on the Mugabe government. Senator Obama also criticizes other African nations, including South Africa as he believes that they have been quiet for far too long and that it is time they all become more forceful in condemning the extraordinary violence-taking place in is Zimbabwe. Former South African President Nelson Mandela also spoke to media stating  "we watch the continued failure of leadership in our neighbouring Zimbabwe"

The Real News Network spoke to Professor Adam Habib, The Vice-Chancellor for Research, Innovation and Advancement at The University of Johannesburg in South Africa about the ongoing political crisis in Zimbabwe.
