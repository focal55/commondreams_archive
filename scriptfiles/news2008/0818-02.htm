LOS ANGELES - August 18 - This morning, Brave New Films will distribute to its list of 500,000 people a new online video meant to bring attention to John McCain's exorbitant personal wealth.  'McCain's Mansions: The Real Elitist' makes the case that McCain's privilege and affluence put him out of touch with the struggles of ordinary working Americans in a recession economy.  The video, which features pictures of six of McCain's ten estates, follows on the heels of a mailer with the same message sent by the AFL-CIO to 50,000 retired union members last week.

Brave New Films' 'Real McCain' videos have been viewed close to 6.5 million times and have helped shape the national media narrative about John McCain: <a href="http://www.therealmccain.com/" target="_new">http://www.therealmccain.com/</a>.
<p></p>
John Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, released this statement in support of the launch of the new video:
<p></p>
"John McCain has shown little concern for the struggles America's hard-working families face in an economy crippled by the policies of the Bush administration.  The reality is that John McCain, who helped create those policies, has ten houses and flies around the world in a private jet. He simply doesn't understand the challenges America's working families are facing because he isn't remotely affected by them."
<p></p>
Andy Stern, President of the Service Employees International Union, said:
<p></p>
"Most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms. John McCain has ten houses. Many working people in America have to work two and three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans. John McCain hops on a private jet. Is it any wonder why McCain champions a George Bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy, helping oil companies turn record profits, and leaving working families to fend for themselves? McCain's velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class and ensure that everyone in America has quality, affordable health insurance."
<p></p>
Robert Greenwald, President of Brave New Films, agreed:
<p></p>
"John McCain pretending to be a friend of working Americans while flying around on his wife's private jet in $500 loafers would be laughable if it weren't such a dangerous charade.  Within the last year over a million Americans have lost their homes to foreclosure, with potentially millions more to come, and yet McCain, who has collected ten houses to himself, finds it appropriate to lecture the public about cutting their vacations short and picking up second jobs.  Americans should be asking themselves whether McCain is really on their side, or if he agrees with his friend Phil Gramm that we're just a 'nation of whiners.'"<!-- #EndEditable -->
