<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 30 - The American Civil 
Liberties Union today expressed skepticism about the announcement yesterday by 
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of a new program intended to remedy 
the nation’s disastrous watch list system.</p><p>“Creating a gigantic 
new database with Americans’ personal information should not be the solution to 
the government’s own incompetence with the terrorist watch list system,” 
said ACLU Technology 
and Liberty Program Director Barry Steinhardt. “One privacy failure should not 
beget another. The government needs to fix the root problem of a mismanaged, 
out-of-control watch list, rather than just collecting more data and creating a 
new database to patch over the real problem.”</p><p>On Monday, 
DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced that his department was creating a new 
database of people who have proven that they are not terrorists, despite being 
confused with a name on the watch list.</p><p>“It’s 
great if the security agencies are really taking action to fix their 
out-of-control watch list – but it’s far from clear that they’re taking the right action, or real action,” said Steinhardt. “What 
they need to do before anything else is shrink the watch list down to a 
manageable size. No one believes that there are a million real terrorists out 
there.”</p><p>The 
nation’s terrorist watch list system has been a persistent problem throughout 
much of the Bush Administration. The Inspector General of the Justice Department 
reported in 2007 that the nation’s terrorist watch list was growing by an 
average of over 20,000 records per month, and that, as of April 2007, it had 
over 700,000 records. An online ACLU “Watch List Counter” based on those numbers 
indicates that, as of today, the list stands at over 958,000 names and will soon 
reach a million.</p><p>In 
addition, because many of the records on the list are extremely common names 
such as Robert Johnson, Gary Smith, and John Williams, far more than a million 
people are affected by the list.</p><p>“This is 
just the latest in a long line of supposed redress mechanisms provided by DHS 
for innocent people caught up in its ham-handed, ID-based security schemes,” 
said ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Timothy Sparapani. “Everyone should 
remember that despite a lot of sweet-sounding promises, these efforts have never 
provided effective, meaningful redress so far. They’re mere 
Band-Aids.”</p><p>Steinhardt 
also asked whether the new database plan was even realistic. Under a scheme 
proposed several years ago called CAPPS II, the airlines would have been 
required to collect new personal information from flyers, and while to the 
layman that sounded easy to do, reliable estimates of the cost of updating the 
complex, interlocking computer systems that make up the world’s airline 
reservations system were in the billions.</p><p>“The devil 
is in the details,” said Sparapani. “If this turns out not to be a technically 
or financially realistic burden to place on the airlines, that would make this 
little more than a public relations ploy with no chance of actually helping 
anyone. We don’t want to see DHS shift blame for this mess and point fingers at 
airlines that can’t reasonably be expected to fix this problem.” Sparapani 
continued,&nbsp;“The airlines don’t need the burden of a giant unfunded mandate 
just now – like the rest of America, they just need the watch 
list to be fixed.”</p><p>“This step 
is just typical of the haphazard, ill-conceived way in which the Bush 
Administration has approached the task of tightening security after 9/11,” said 
Sparapani. “It has placed a misguided emphasis on ID-based security, which never 
can be very effective. And it has never thought through the implications of that 
approach for the millions of innocent people who are unfairly or mistakenly 
caught up in these systems.”</p><p align="left">More information about watch lists,
