<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 21 - “Sixteen years after the creation of World Water Day, we are standing at a crossroads – either we can ignore the impending world water crisis at our own peril or we can act to ensure that every human being has the right to safe and affordable water.  Now more than ever we have the know-how and technologies needed to make sure that every community has reliable access to this vital resource. However, what is lacking in our country and in many countries worldwide is the political will to devote the necessary resources to ensure safe water for all.
<p></p>
“Unfortunately, as the world is running out of clean water and demand is growing exponentially, the private sector – often backed by international finance institutions - has taken over many water utilities that were once controlled by local government. But communities that have experimented with privatization have found that it does not solve their water woes, and are now choosing to break ties to their private water providers and instead opt for public ownership of their water services.
<p></p>
“The future of our water lies not in further privatization but in a renewed commitment to safe and affordable public water. In the United States we have the opportunity to be a model for the world in keeping water a public resource and human right by investing in our water infrastructure. As citizens, we can choose to break the bottled water habit and take back the tap. As a nation, we can create a national clean water trust fund to ensure a steady, reliable source of funding for public utilities for years to come. For the sake of our nation and its future, we need a long-term solution to secure the protection of clean water.”
