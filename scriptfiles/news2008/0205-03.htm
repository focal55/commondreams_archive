<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 5 -With record numbers of
Americans voting this Super Tuesday, Campaign for America's Future
co-directors Robert Borosage and Roger Hickey today announced that their
organization's 2008 "<a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/take-back-america-2008" target="_new">Take Back America</a>" conference will be held from
Monday, March 17 to Wednesday, March 19 at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in
Washington, D.C. This year's conference will bring together thousands of
progressive activists, bloggers and organizational leaders to launch a
major citizen-led campaign to "Take Back America."

<P></P>

    Progressive leaders at the "<a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/take-back-america-2008" target="_new">Take Back America</a>" conference plan to
highlight key elements of their mobilization efforts to ensure that
politicians are forced to deliver on a progressive agenda long after the
elections. In an email to supporters Borosage and Hickey wrote, "In order
to seize the debate, we must get to work early," referencing the fact that
the conference usually held in June will take place in early spring. "Our
challenge in 2008 is to build a crystal clear mandate and unstoppable
momentum for dramatic progressive change."


<P></P>
    Propelled by victories in the mid-term elections and outraged by the
president's repeated failures, more than 3,000 activists gathered last June
for the group's 2007 conference to showcase a progressive movement on the
rise. All the top presidential candidates attended last year's conference
to make their case to progressive leaders and activists from across the
country.

<P></P>

    With a majority of Americans standing with progressives on issues
ranging from opposing the war in Iraq to supporting bold action on clean
energy, health care and economic policies, progressives are driving the
national political debate. This past year, progressives gained popularity,
strength, institutional capacity, political sophistication, an expanded
coalition and exciting new leaders. At the same time, the conservative
movement is in disarray and Americans have turned against the catastrophic
failures of the Bush administration.
