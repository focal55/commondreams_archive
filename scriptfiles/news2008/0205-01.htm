<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 5 - The following is the statement of Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA, about the President’s budget that was submitted to Congress today:
 <p></p>
“At the same time that the President seeks to make permanent his huge and wasteful tax cuts for the wealthy, he intends to slash approximately $200 billion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This is a clear case of misplaced priorities.
  <p></p>
“Additionally, instead of providing America’s families with real reform and relief from fast-rising, unaffordable health care costs, the President offers the same tired, tax-based proposals that have been rejected by Congress year after year.
  <p></p>
“It has been the unfortunate hallmark of President Bush’s budgets that they have ignored the growing affordability crisis families are experiencing with health care. Sadly, it is clear that we will have to wait at least another year for leadership that begins to address our nation’s healthcare problems with real solutions.”
