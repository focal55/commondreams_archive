<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 16 - President Bush is set to announce later today a set of "realistic" goals for curbing global warming emissions, perhaps as little as merely stopping the growth of emissions by 2025.  Scientists tell us that we need to cut total emissions at least 15 - 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 in order to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming.  Merely halting the growth of emissions is grossly insufficient.
<p></p>
This announcement, coming after nearly 7 years devoted to blocking state and federal action on global warming, seems little more than an effort to undercut attempts by Congress and others to advance meaningful solutions to the problem.  The Bush administration has brazenly defied the Supreme Court on this issue for over a year, opposed efforts to require more electricity to be generated from renewable sources, and unlawfully denied California and more than 15 other states the right to proceed with landmark global warming emissions standards for vehicles.  The administration has even consistently refused to state whether global warming pollution endangers public health or welfare.

<b>Statement of Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director
</b>
<p></p>
<b>"The president is throwing a Hail Mary to polluters in a last-ditch effort to stave off any meaningful action on global warming.  Under the president's plan we'll need a real miracle to save us from global warming.&quot;</b><!-- #EndEditable -->
