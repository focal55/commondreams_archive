<p>WASHINGTON, DC - May 1 - On June 5, 2008 hundreds of democracy activists and organizers will gather for Democracy Day, a one-day gathering organized in conjunction with the National Conference on Media Reform. Democracy Day is a joint project of FairVote, the Liberty Tree Foundation, Public Campaign and Common Cause with support from local partners FairVote MN, Verified Voting, TakeAction Minnesota and the Center for Election Integrity Minnesota. This one day conference will take place at the Minneapolis Hilton from 9:00am-7:00pm. Registration information can be found at www.claimdemocracy.org. Complimentary registration for members of the media can be obtained by calling Ross Margulies, FairVote Development Director, at 301.270.4616.

"Our powerful line-up of speakers underscores the growing power and vision of pro-democracy reformers - and the connections that exist between an independent and vigorous media and transformative electoral reform," writes FairVote's Rob Richie.  Former Congressman Dr. Bob Edgar, Executive Director of Washington, D.C. based Common Cause, stated that, "While every day should be Democracy Day in America, this conference provides a special opportunity for activists and experts to come together and strengthen the movement for self-government in our country."
<P></P>
In the run-up to the upcoming presidential elections, the Democracy Day conference will include workshops addressing electoral reform, instant runoff voting, election integrity and protection, student unionism, and a host of other visionary work aimed at expanding, deepening, broadening, and protecting U.S. democracy.
Featured speakers include:
<P></P>
<li>Award-winning Author Walter Mosley,<li>Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie,<li>Radio Host Amy Goodman,<li>The Nation Columnist John Nichols,<li>Former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic and FairVote Chair,<li>Former Presidential candidate David Cobb<li>And other leaders in the national democracy movement.
<P></P>
Please inquire about opportunities to schedule interviews with any speakers during the conference.

FairVote MN Executive Director Jeanne Massey said, "Now more than ever we need to be fully and deeply engaged in a discussion around the future of our Democracy. For eight years we have watched our democratic institutions attacked and weakened, but, here in Minnesota with passage of instant runoff voting in Minneapolis in 2006 and the St. Paul IRV campaign in 2008, we are committed to expanding democracy. It is right that the first Democracy Day conference is held here."
<P></P>
The conference is a continuation of the work of the Claim Democracy Coalition, which is a national coalition spearheaded by FairVote which held the Claim Democracy Conference in November 2007 in Washington, DC.<!-- #EndEditable -->
