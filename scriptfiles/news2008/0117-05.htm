<p>NEVADA - January 17 -  Friends of the Earth Action announced today that it has begun airing a radio ad and web ads in Nevada that encourage the state’s residents to consider presidential candidates’ positions on Yucca Mountain and nuclear power before Tuesday’s caucuses.
</p><p>
“You can’t say you oppose storing waste at Yucca Mountain and then turn around and support more nuclear power,” said Friends of the Earth Action President Brent Blackwelder.  “More nuclear power means more waste, and more waste means more pressure to open up Yucca Mountain—which hurts Nevada. There are better alternatives, including solar arrays that can harness sun in the Nevada desert, energy efficiency, and wind and geothermal power. Nevadans should know where the presidential candidates stand on this issue.”
</p><p>

The radio ad, titled “Expand,” notes that President Bush recently signed a congressional omnibus spending bill that includes $20 billion in loan guarantees for the construction of new nuclear plants.  This money could jumpstart a new era of nuclear plant construction across the U.S., leading to more radioactive waste and increasing pressure to open Yucca Mountain.  The ad will run on stations in Las Vegas and Reno.  The web ads will run on a number of Nevada sites, including the home pages of the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the Reno Gazette-Journal.
</p><p>
Friends of the Earth Action’s aim is to raise the profile of this issue prior to the caucuses.  The organization has endorsed John Edwards for President, in part because of his opposition to new nuclear power plants.
