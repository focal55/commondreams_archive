May 23 - ACORN has helped register 435,000 new voters since September – moving closer to its goal of completing 1.2 million voter registrations this elections cycle, in what could be the largest non-partisan voter registration effort in U.S. history.
<p></p>
In 26 states across the country, ACORN members and organizers have been standing on street corners, going door-to-door, visiting shopping malls, barbershops and libraries, to register African American, Latino, young and low-income citizens—those who have been historically underrepresented in the American electorate.
<p></p>
"I’m excited because I feel as though I finally have a voice," said New Orleans resident Glenn Bratley after he registered to vote for the first time. "I want to see change in this country. I want a president for the people; a president who will make opportunities available for all people to have a better life." 
<p></p>
Since 2003, ACORN had helped more than 1.68 million people to register to vote. The organization will follow its 2008 registration effort with a Get Out the Vote campaign in ACORN neighborhoods this fall.<!-- #EndEditable -->
