<p>WASHINGTON - January 7 -<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Purpose:</strong>
<P></P>
Amidst the ongoing mortgage and credit crises, there are increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slipping toward recession.  Oil prices topped the $100-a-barrel mark recently. The manufacturing sector contracted in December and payrolls grew less than expected, while the unemployment rate hit a two-year high of 5%.  In response, the Dow Jones Industrial average lost 3.5% in the first three days of trading in 2008, while the Standard and Poor’s 500 index fell 3.86%, and the NASDAQ composite index dropped 5.57%.  
<P></P>
The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), co-chaired by U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee and Lynn Woolsey and CPC Economy Task Force Leaders – U.S. Representatives Phil Hare, Marcy Kaptur, and Jan Schakowsky -- will host a Capitol Hill Town Hall Meeting to assess the current state of our national economy and preview an action plan to advance the legislative priorities and prescriptions contained in the CPC’s legislative program in the 110th Congress and beyond, which is called The Progressive Promise.  (See attached copy.)   This gathering will also be co-hosted by the Campaign for America’s Future, the American Prospect magazine, and cosponsored by other organizations and coalitions.
