WASHINGTON, DC - June 2 - “Consideration of the Climate Security Act demonstrates that the highest levels of our government are finally listening to a longstanding call from American citizens to stop global warming. Unfortunately, without major improvements, the legislation won’t achieve the dramatic changes needed to avoid catastrophic climate impacts.
<P></P>
“We urge the Senate to strengthen the bill in several critical ways:
<P></P>
“First, the bill must require that emissions of global warming pollutants be reduced by at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. To get us back on track, it must mandate emissions reductions of at least 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, coupled with a robust scientific review process to ensure we are meeting this crucial target. Regrettably, as written, the legislation will not meet these key objectives.
<P></P>
“Second, the bill gives the fossil fuel industry hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies and free pollution credits, creating windfall profits for the industries most responsible for global warming and stripping vital resources away from America’s transition to a clean energy future.  Polluters should pay for 100 percent of the credits and the revenue generated should be used to help working families deal with rising energy costs and to invest in safe and clean energy solutions like wind and solar.
<P></P>
“Additionally, the bill must commit the country to re-engage in an international process to reduce worldwide emissions and make us a leader in the urgent fight to stop global warming.
<P></P>
“It also must set the country on a path to long-term energy independence by increasing its support of renewable energy and efficiency measures—an investment that will simultaneously fight global warming and create jobs.
<P></P>
“Finally, any amendments proposed to promote nuclear power must be rejected. The construction of new nuclear plants is a wasteful and dangerous distraction from real energy solutions. After 50 years of unresolved safety and waste disposal issues, it is high time to move away from nuclear and invest in proven and safe solutions like wind and solar.
 <P></P>
“Scientists have shown we only have a small window of opportunity to take meaningful action to end global warming. Our country is facing air pollution, failing transportation infrastructure, record gas prices and global warming effects that demand an immediate change in energy policy. As currently written, the Climate Security act falls short of this critical challenge. We call on the Senate to strengthen the bill so that it is capable of dealing with the magnitude of the crisis at hand.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
