WASHINGTON - July 28 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force expresses its condolences to the families of the victims of a tragic shooting at a church that welcomes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. On Sunday, a man opened fire at the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tenn., killing two people and injuring seven others. Police are investigating the possible hate crime angle of this shooting, since the perpetrator reportedly expressed hatred for the liberal views of the church.</p> 

<p align="center"><b>Statement by Rea Carey, Executive Director<br>
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force</b></p>

<p>“We express our heartfelt condolences to the families of those whose lives were lost yesterday and wish a full recovery to those who were injured. This attack is tragic, abominable and senseless. We pray and hope for comfort to the families of the victims and to the congregants of this welcoming church. Our deepest sympathies are with everyone affected by this terrible event. We condemn any crime motivated by hate or bias.”<br>
  <br>
  <em>The mission of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is to build the grassroots power of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. We do this by training activists, equipping state and local organizations with the skills needed to organize broad-based campaigns to defeat anti-LGBT referenda and advance pro-LGBT legislation, and building the organizational capacity of our movement. Our Policy Institute, the movement’s premier think tank, provides research and policy analysis to support the struggle for complete equality and to counter right-wing lies. As part of a broader social justice movement, we work to create a nation that respects the diversity of human expression and identity and creates opportunity for all. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., we also have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis and Cambridge.</em></p><!-- #EndEditable -->
