<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 12 - The League of Women Voters today expressed concerns about the new ethics procedures passed by a House vote of 229 to 182 last night.
<p></p>
“This does not provide the independent ethics enforcement process that is needed to clean up the House and protect the public interest,” said Mary G. Wilson, national president of the League of Women Voters. 
<p></p>
“The investigative powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics are simply insufficient,” Wilson continued.  “Without access to subpoena power, investigators will not be able to compel cooperation from outside entities and individuals, congressional staff and Members,” she said.
<p></p>
“Voters in 2006 clearly reacted to the ‘business as usual’ approach that Congress took to the scandals that plagued the House.  Voters continue to have high expectations for ethics reform.  They want changes that will be strong and effective,” Wilson said.  “This agreement falls short,” she said.
<p></p>
“This proposal will prove to be inadequate and will have to be revisited, probably when the next wave of public scandals arrives,” Wilson said.
<p></p>
“The League is disappointed that this proposal is the best the House is willing, or able, to achieve,” Wilson concluded.
