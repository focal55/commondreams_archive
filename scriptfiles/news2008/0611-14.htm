June 11 - A diverse group of politicians, including Barbara Lee, Ron Paul and Lynn Woolsey, gathered in Washington on Tuesday along with activists and other citizens for "Time to Talk with Iran", an event and press conference held by the Campaign for a New American Policy on Iran.
<p></p>
Supporters of the campaign rallied to underline the substantial human and financial cost that would result from any military confrontation with Iran at a time when "the same people who supported a disastrous war of choice in Iraq," said Barbara Lee, "are now steadily beating the drum for war with Iran."  Lynn Woolsey stressed that "negotiation isn't just the best choice for this situation, it is the right choice, it is the only choice."
<p></p>
Another speaker was former CIA officer Phil Giraldi, who said he has no allusions about Iran and its government, that it is not a benign institution, but that there are "very serious consequences to any kind of military action against Iran." Retaliation against US military presence in the region, rising gas prices, Iran's control over terrorism resources, and Iran's ability to make the situation extremely difficult in Iraq and "possibly untenable" for American troops are just some of the consequences the nation could face.
<p></p>
Representative Ron Paul also took the podium to say Congress must do "everything possible" in light of the "atrocious" removal of instructions that would disallow the president from taking action against Iran without permission of Congress from legislation, and noted that talking is key.
<p></p>
Red sixties-style telephones were set up with Iranians on the other line to allow informal conversation between citizens of the two countries. "I think it shows the public that dialogue is possible," Lee told The Real News Network, "and that if we can talk people-to-people, then certainly our governments should be able to talk."
