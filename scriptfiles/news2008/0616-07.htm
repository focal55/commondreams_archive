WASHINGTON, DC - June 16 - As flood waters continue to inundate Midwest communities, American Rivers today called on its activists and members across the country to support relief efforts.</p>
<p>Rebecca Wodder, president of American Rivers, made the following statement:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
<p>“The images and stories are simply devastating. Our hearts go out to the families and communities of the Upper Midwest who have lost loved ones and have seen their homes damaged or destroyed by floodwaters.”</p>
<p>“Our focus now must be on ensuring public safety and helping communities recover from these disastrous events.”</p>
<p>“We can all do our part to help the victims. Consider making a donation to the Red Cross, or other reputable charitable organization helping with the relief effort.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Please help the flood victims. Consider donating to the American <a href="http://www.redcross.org/" target="_blank">Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund </a>or P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C. 20013. (800) 842-2200</p>
