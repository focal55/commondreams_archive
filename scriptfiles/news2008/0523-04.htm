WASHINGTON, DC - May 23 - Today, by bipartisan a vote of 234 to 183, the House adopted Congresswoman Barbara Lee’s amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act requiring congressional approval of  any agreement between the U.S. and Iraq making commitments related to Iraq’s security. 
<P></P>
In November 2007 President Bush and Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed the “Declaration of Principles for Friendship and Cooperation,” which included an unprecedented commitment to “defend Iraq against internal and external threats.” 
<P></P>
A long term security agreement is currently under negotiation. This amendment will ensure that any such agreement will require Congressional Approval, either by treaty ratification or otherwise.

 <P></P>

A traditional Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) would not require congressional approval, but the agreement being negotiated appears likely to go far beyond a traditional SOFA.    
<P></P>
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's administration has said that any agreement negotiated between the U.S. and Iraq must be approved by the Iraqi parliament before it becomes law. 
<P></P>
“If prior review and approval is good enough for the Iraqi Parliament, it is essential for the Congress,” said Lee. 
<P></P>
“This amendment is about the future. Do we want the next President and Congress to inherit a situation where our troops are committed to fight Iraqi civil wars and any entity the Iraq deems a threat? Do we want to do that without having even debated it or allowing Congressional review? The answer is: no.” <!-- #EndEditable -->
