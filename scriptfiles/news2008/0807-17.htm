WASHINGTON - August 7 - In response to a question today in Lima, OH, Senator John McCain turned the subject to the Supreme Court and bragged about his support of George W. Bush’s nominees to the Supreme Court.
<p></p>
 

In response, People For the American Way president Kathryn Kolbert issued the following statement:

 <p></p>

“It’s clear that John McCain is trying to polish his anti-choice credentials by highlighting his support for George W. Bush’s judges. 

 <p></p>

“By appointing more judges like President Bush’s, McCain wouldn’t just help undermine the right to choose, he’d make it harder for women victimized by workplace discrimination to find justice.  He’d make it easier for polluters to poison the water our children drink.  He’d protect giant corporations that injure and kill Americans with faulty products.  John McCain is promising to give us not just four more years of George Bush’s policies, but 40.

 <p></p>

“Americans don’t support the radical judicial philosophy of George Bush and John McCain.  The Supreme Court is on the ballot in November.  John McCain needs to support judges who support our rights.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
