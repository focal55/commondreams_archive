<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 16 - Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) gave the following speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives this morning:
<P></P>
“Over the past few years, this Administration has been beating the drums of war against Iran. There are parallels between their efforts to try to create a war against Iran and the falsehoods that set us on a path to war against Iraq.
<P></P>
“We know that the United States intelligence community was able to demonstrate that the Administration’s claims that Iran had a nuclear weapons program were, in fact, not true.
<P></P>
“The January 6 incident at the Strait of Hormuz is still another cause for this Congress to look deeply at the Administration’s Iranian war buildup.
<P></P>
“It appears from news reports that the Department of Defense grossly inflated an encounter that took place in the Strait -- an encounter that was not unlike any that had taken place before. Not only did the Department of Defense inflate it, but they fabricated information that would cause the American people to believe that Iran was demonstrating military aggressiveness.
<P></P>
“We really have to get off the path of war toward Iran and start working on building diplomatic relations.”<!-- #EndEditable -->
