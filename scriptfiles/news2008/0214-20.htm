<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 14 - This year, the media have chosen a new valentine to
swoon over:
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) -- the media heart McCain<em><em>. </em></em>With
the presidential primaries heating up, <em>Media
Matters for America </em>thought it might be helpful to provide you with
examples of how the media have fawned over McCain's presidential campaign;
lauding him as a "maverick" and "straight talker" while overlooking his
flip-flops. </p>

<p><em>Media
Matters</em> has also released a video compiling numerous examples
of the media's repeated reference to McCain as a "maverick." View the video
<a href="/rd?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXjFK4vcHY8">here</a>. </p>

<p>More detailed
descriptions of <em>Media Matters</em>'
top items on these themes and links to full text are included below:</p>

<p><a href="/items/200802070004"></a><strong><a href="/items/200802070004">MSNBC's Brzezinski asked if McCain is
"the perfect candidate" without disclosing that her brother advises
him</a> </strong></p>

<p>On MSNBC's <em><em>Morning Joe</em></em>, Mika Brzezinski asked
presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin: "[A]t this moment in history,
isn't John McCain the perfect candidate to deal with what challenges we face as
a country, and given the presidency that is just coming to a close right
now?" At no point during the segment, however, did Brzezinski disclose
that her brother is a McCain adviser. </p>

<p><a href="/items/200802130009"></a><strong><a href="/items/200802130009">Kudlow cited <em>WSJ</em> editorial board member to claim
"McCain is no flip-flopper," but <em>WSJ</em>

already noted "McCain's Tax Reversal"</a> </strong></p>

<p>In his February 9 nationally syndicated column, CNBC host Lawrence
Kudlow wrote: "McCain is no flip-flopper. ... Think of his
duty-honor-loyalty persona, to borrow from my friend Kim Strassel of the Wall
Street Journal." Strassel wrote in her <em>Wall
Street Journal</em> column on February 1 that McCain is "no
flip-flopper, and his duty-honor-loyalty persona would stand in stark contrast
to both Clintons."
However, the <em>Journal</em> editorial
board, of which Strassel is and was at the time a member, published an
editorial on February 18, 2006 -- headlined "McCain's Tax Reversal"
-- noting that after voting against President Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003,
McCain voted in 2006 to make some of them permanent. </p>

<p><a href="/items/200802080016"></a><strong><a href="/items/200802080016">CNN contributor Bennett's donation to
McCain not disclosed during discussion of senator</a> </strong></p>

<p>On CNN's <em>The Situation Room</em>,
radio talk show host and CNN contributor Bill Bennett defended McCain against
criticism he has received from radio host Laura Ingraham and other
conservatives. But Bennett and host Wolf Blitzer both failed to disclose that
Bennett has given more than $2,000 to McCain's presidential campaign. </p>

<p><a href="/items/200802110002"><strong>CNN's Sesno suggests McCain owns
copyright on "straight talk" label</strong></a></p>

<p>Referring to the Democratic presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama,
CNN special correspondent Frank Sesno said: "[M]oney is pouring in, but
with apologies to John McCain, you might hear some straight talk, too." In
assigning McCain ownership of the "straight talk" label, Sesno joined
a long line of media, including CNN hosts and correspondents, who have adopted
McCain's self-laudatory label of "straight-talker" despite his stark
inconsistency on numerous issues.</p>

<p><a href="/items/200802070005"><strong>Print press repeats media mantra of
McCain as "maverick"</strong></a></p>

<p>In their coverage of the February 5 presidential primaries and
caucuses, numerous print publications -- including <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The
Washington Post</em>, and the <em>Los
Angeles Times</em> -- continued a longstanding practice of referring to
McCain as a "maverick" who has challenged Washington and his own
party, despite a lifetime rating of 83 by the American Conservative Union and
his recent rightward shift on high-profile issues such as immigration and
taxes. </p>

<p><a href="/items/200802130002"><strong><em>Baltimore Sun</em>, <em>San Antonio Express-News</em> endorsements
wrongly suggest McCain still supports comprehensive immigration reform</strong></a></p>

<p>In endorsing McCain's bid for the Republican presidential nomination, <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> asserted that McCain has
"stood his ground" on "immigration reform." However, while
McCain now says that border security must be addressed first, he previously
said that border security could not be disaggregated from other provisions in
the legislation on immigration reform. Similarly, the <em>San Antonio Express-News </em>claimed in its
endorsement of McCain that his "advocacy for comprehensive immigration
reform" is among the positions that may "be attractive" to
"independent voters"; but McCain has said he "would not"
vote for his own comprehensive immigration reform proposals.</p>

<p><a href="/items/200802120006"><strong><em>Politico</em></strong></a><a href="/items/200802120006"></a><strong><a href="/items/200802120006">/WJLA forum hosts
claimed McCain has "regularly" "stood up" to Republican
Party</a> </strong></p>

<p>During interviews with Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, <em>Politico</em>'s John F. Harris and ABC 7's Leon
Harris each claimed that McCain has "regularly" "stood up"
to the Republican Party. But McCain has altered his positions on significant
issues, such as taxes and immigration, to more closely align himself with the
base of the Republican Party, and has been one of the most constant and
forceful proponents of the Iraq war and its continuation. </p>

<p><a href="/items/200802120009"></a><strong><a href="/items/200802120009">Ignoring conservative record, MSNBC's
Barnicle claimed that McCain is "in the middle"</a> </strong></p>

<p>On <em>Morning Joe</em>, guest
co-host Mike Barnicle claimed that while in "most campaigns,"
"Republicans begin on the right for their campaign and come to the middle
for the fall," McCain is "in the middle and he has to swing right for
the primaries." In fact, McCain has already shifted rightward on
immigration and taxes, and McCain himself has asserted that he is a
"mainstream conservative." </p>

<p><a href="/items/200802070007"><strong>Claiming that McCain's
"straight-talker image" would be jeopardized by flip-flops, Gannett
News Service doesn't note they've already occurred</strong></a></p>

<p>A Gannett News Service article claimed that McCain "has built up
such a straight-talker image that any aroma of pandering or changing positions
to placate conservatives would expose him to the flip-flopping label he has
pinned on [Mitt] Romney." In fact, on two of the issues cited -- taxes and
immigration -- McCain has changed his positions to more closely align himself
with the base of the Republican Party, which the article did not note.</p>
