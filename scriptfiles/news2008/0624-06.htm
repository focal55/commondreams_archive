WASHINGTON - June 24 - Drawing a global spotlight on child labour, the UN marked the annual World Day against Child Labor last Thursday.  
<P></P>
Just a day earlier, police and activists in New Delhi, India, rescued 62 trafficked children from sweatshops. Most of the children had come from farming families in Bihar, India's poorest eastern state. Officials said the children were rescued under the Bonded Labour Abolition Act 1976, and will be sent back to their families under supervision to ensure they are not sent back out again.  
<P></P>
"I don't get any money," said Ramu Kumar, one of the rescued children. 
<P></P>
The net of India's child labor laws manages to catch some of the trafficked children, but leaves others behind. Factory workers outsource work to many children in urban areas to work in homes.  
<P></P>
Pradeep Narayanan, of India-based Child Rights and You, says that that current legislation is inadequate. 
<P></P>
Naryanan explains that with "an adequate plan and programs" which "not only rescue the children from the labor, but also rehabilitates them with their families," then children have a hope of staying out of the labor force.
