<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - March 10 -  At 4:59 pm last Friday and with no fanfare, EPA Region
IX released a long-awaited and highly-contested decision to declare that
the particulate matter pollution (i.e., the dust, soot, and smoke that
frequently turn the skies brown in the fall and winter) in the Valley is
no longer a concern for residents or lawmakers despite numerous
violations of the air quality standard.
<p></p>
EPA first proposed to sweep the Valley's dust problems under the rug
back in the summer of 2006, when it made an initial finding that the
Valley had attained the national standard for particulate matter so long
as dangerous levels of pollution recorded by certain air quality
monitors could be ignored.
<p></p>
But even as lawmakers were popping the champagne corks, the Valley
experienced one of its worst pollution seasons on record with a slew of
additional air quality violations. Yet EPA chose to ignore this
evidence, too. The agency refused to take back its original
determination that the Valley's air was clean, so Earthjustice and
Valley residents were forced to go to court to reverse that illegal
action.
<p></p>
EPA's unprecedented "affirmation" of its 2006 attainment finding for the
Valley flies in the face of clear evidence that the Valley's air is
still a danger to public health.
<p></p>
"It's unthinkable to me that the Regional Administrator can say to the
people of Arvin or Fresno or any other city in this polluted Valley,
'you are a priority for us,' while his agency is throwing in the towel,"
says Kevin Hall, long-time Fresno resident and Air Quality Chair of the
Sierra Club's Tehipite Chapter. "EPA has a long history of neglect in
this Valley, and once again, they're ignoring our suffering to protect
polluters."
<p></p>
Earthjustice and other concerned groups are reviewing EPA's decision and
plan to take the agency back to court choosing to ignore the Valley's
continuing pollution problems.
<p></p>
"EPA is telling people not to worry about dozens of violation days, the
most recent one occurring just two months ago," says Earthjustice air
quality researcher Sarah Jackson. "This is not about the air being clean
or residents being able to breathe easier; this is all about EPA keeping
promises to polluters and gaming the data to try and make the problem go
away."
<p></p>
"When I stop seeing Valley residents in the ER gasping for breath, then
I'll pop the champagne," says respiratory therapist and Fresno resident
Kevin Hamilton.  "Until then, we'll see EPA in court."
