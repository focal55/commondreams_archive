WASHINGTON - July 22 - With an advertiser pulling
sponsorship and a radio network dropping his program, conservative talk-radio
host Michael Savage yesterday sought to recast controversial comments he made
last week in which he said autism is "[a] fraud, a hoax" and that
most children with autism are just "brat[s]" who haven't
"been told to cut the act out."</p>

<p>Responding to the uproar caused by his comments, Savage said, "I
stand by my words," and he lashed out at <em>Media
Matters for America</em>, the progressive media watchdog that on Thursday
first noted Savage's controversial remarks. Despite using words such as
"dummy," "idiot," "brat," "moron,"
and "fool" to refer to children with autism, Savage said he was
misquoted and taken out of context.</p>

<p>"Michael Savage is desperately trying to dig himself out of a hole
by qualifying his original comments," said J. Jioni
 Palmer, a spokesman for <em>Media
Matters</em>. "The reality is he didn't use any qualifiers
when taking his mean-spirited swipe at children with autism and their
families."</p>

<p>Savage's comments on his nationally syndicated radio program have
been roundly denounced by a host of organizations seeking to raise awareness
and promote sensitivity regarding the needs of those with autism. During the
same program, Savage said children in "the minority community" were
told to say they had asthma as part of a "money racket" to get
"extra welfare" benefits.</p>

<p>In response to Savage's remarks, the insurance company AFLAC
announced it will no longer sponsor Savage's program, while the
seven-station <em>Super Talk Mississippi</em>
radio network has decided to drop Savage's program from its lineup.</p>

<p>"Savage can try to obfuscate matters all he wants, but the fact
remains -- his words are his words, and they were clearly directed at children
with autism," Palmer said. "Instead of trying to shift blame, he
ought to do what's right and apologize to the millions of autistic
children, their families, and others he insulted."</p>

<p>Talk Radio Network, which syndicates <em><em>The
Savage Nation</em></em>, claims that Savage is heard on more than 350
radio stations. <em><em>The Savage Nation</em></em>
reaches at least 8.25 million listeners each week, according to <em><em>Talkers Magazine</em></em>, making it one of the
most listened-to talk radio shows in the nation, behind only <em><em>The Rush Limbaugh Show</em></em> and <em><em>The Sean Hannity Show</em></em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Savage
falsely recasts autism remarks to claim he was "take[n] out of
context"</strong></p>

<p><a href="/items/200807220003">http://mediamatters.org/items/200807220003</a></p>

<p>Michael Savage recast July 16 comments he made about
autism in order to claim that he was "take[n] out of context."
Savage falsely suggested that his comments distinguished between "the
truly autistic" and those he described on July 21 as "the
misdiagnosed, the falsely diagnosed, and the outright fakers in the autism
field."</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
