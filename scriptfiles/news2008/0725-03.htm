WASHINGTON - July 25 -  The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund applauds the U.S. House’s vote late yesterday to repeal the HIV travel ban. The Senate voted July 16 to repeal the prohibition, which was codified by Congress in 1993. While immigration law currently excludes foreigners with any “communicable disease of public health significance” from entering the country, only HIV is explicitly named in the statute.
<P></P>
Statement by Rea Carey, Executive Director,<br>

National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund:
<P></P>
"For far too long, people with HIV have been inhumanely blocked from entering the United States due to profound ignorance, fear and misinformation. It’s time to abolish this arcane and unjust law once and for all. We applaud the House and Senate for acting to do just that, and we urge President Bush to move swiftly to sign the repeal.”
<P></P>
