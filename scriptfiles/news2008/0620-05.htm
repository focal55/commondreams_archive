WASHINGTON, DC - June 20 - Following a vote in the House of Representatives 
sanctioning warrantless wiretapping and handing immunity to telecommunications 
companies for their role in domestic spying, the American Civil Liberties Union 
expressed outrage at representatives who voted for the unconstitutional 
legislation. The bill, H.R. 6304, or The FISA Amendments Act of 2008, passed the 
chamber by a vote of 293-129, and is expected to be voted on in the Senate next 
week. </p>
<p>The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson, director of the 
ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office: </p>

<p>"It’s Christmas morning at the White House thanks to this vote. The House 
just wrapped up some expensive gifts for the administration and their buddies at 
the phone companies. Watching the House fall to scare tactics and political 
maneuvering is especially infuriating given the way it stood up to pressure from 
the president on this same issue just months ago. In March we thought the House 
leadership had finally grown a backbone by rejecting the Senate’s FISA bill. Now 
we know they will not stand up for the Constitution.</p>
<p>"No matter how often the opposition calls this bill a ‘compromise,’ it is not 
a meaningful compromise, except of our constitutional rights. The bill allows 
for mass, untargeted and unwarranted surveillance of all communications coming 
in to and out of the United States. The courts’ role is superficial at best, as 
the government can continue spying on our communications even after the FISA 
court has objected. Democratic leaders turned what should have been an easy FISA 
fix into the wholesale giveaway of our Fourth Amendment rights.</p>
<p>"More than two years after the president’s domestic spying was revealed in 
the pages of the New York Times, Congress’ fury and shock has dissipated 
to an obedient whimper. After scrambling for years to cover their tracks, the 
phone companies and the administration are almost there. This immunity provision 
will effectively destroy Americans’ chance to have their deserved day in court 
and will kill any possibility of learning the extent of the administration’s 
lawless actions. The House should be ashamed of itself. The fate of the Fourth 
Amendment is now in the Senate’s hands. We can only hope senators will show more 
courage than their colleagues in the House."</p>
