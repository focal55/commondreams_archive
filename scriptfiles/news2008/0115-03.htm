<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 15 - “The Food and Drug Administration’s decision to allow the sale of
meat and milk from cloned animals leaves consumers at risk and
releases another questionable technology into the food supply.
<P></P>
“The agency announced today that it has finalized its risk assessment
on eating meat and milk from cloned animals, the final step before a
voluntary moratorium on selling these products is lifted. FDA’s draft
risk assessment relied on only a handful of studies conducted by the
cloning industry and included little long-term evidence. Even the
agency’s own science board released a report last month stating that
FDA has a ‘lack of expertise in risk/benefit assessment.’
<P></P>
“While more complete research is needed on this technology, there is
still an underlying objection from consumers based on ethical and
animal welfare concerns. More than 150,000 people submitted comments
to FDA earlier this year opposing animal food cloning. But despite
widespread public disapproval, FDA is not planning to require
labeling of products from cloned animals, keeping already wary
consumers in the dark.
<P></P>
“In addition to disregarding public concerns, FDA is also blatantly
disregarding directions from Congress. Just last month, the Senate
passed the farm bill and the entire Congress passed the omnibus
appropriations bill. Both included provisions urging FDA to do more
studies on cloning before final approval is given. But rather than
listening to Congress and acting in the public interest, the federal
agency is caving into industry pressure.
<P></P>
“The recent announcement by the cloning industry about a voluntary
registry of cloned food animals does nothing to address the very real
safety questions and ethical concerns that remain about this
technology. Rather than weak proposals about how to track this latest
controversial food technology, we need an honest assessment of
whether it should be used at all. Until this happens, cloned animals
or their offspring should not be allowed to enter the food supply.”
