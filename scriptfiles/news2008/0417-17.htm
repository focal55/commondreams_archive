<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 17 - The Center for Economic and Policy Research responded to a debate about the Venezuelan economy that started with a Foreign Affairs article in the March/April 2008 issue which had alleged "a close look at the evidence reveals just how much Chávez's 'revolution' has hurt Venezuela's economy -- and that the poor are hurting most of all."
<p></p>
In a paper published last month, CEPR had shown these allegations to be contradicted by the available data.
<p></p>
The current paper, "<a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=ggLy3nonvOzoWvlM845KvYM4WcVzM89y" target="_new">How Not to Attack an Economist (and an Economy): Getting the Numbers Right</a>" by CEPR economist and Co-Director <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=fcqym6jGtwF%2BIECtPuIILIM4WcVzM89y" target="_new">Mark Weisbrot</a>, responds to a Working Paper at Wesleyan University entitled, "How Not to Defend the Revolution: Mark Weisbrot and the Misinterpretation of Venezuelan Evidence," by economist Francisco Rodriguez which defended his original analysis in Foreign Affairs.
<p></p>
"The Venezuelan economy has been booming for five consecutive years now, with the poverty rate cut by more than half and real (inflation-adjusted) GDP increasing by more than 87 percent, with very little of that in oil," said Weisbrot.
<p></p>
"Real social spending per person has also tripled, with increased access to subsidized food, health care, and education for the poor. There really shouldn't be any question about these basic issues, and this debate should make that clear."
<p></p>
The paper also shows that the amount of poverty reduction accomplished in Venezuela during the current economic expansion, relative to the growth that has occurred, compares quite favorably to other countries - contrary to one of the main allegations in the Foreign Affairs article.
<p></p>
Weisbrot also noted that because of the current political climate and bad relations between the Bush Administration and the Venezuelan government, allegations about Venezuela - whether it is regarding the economy, the war on drugs, or terrorism - are often accepted without proper scrutiny.
<p></p>
"It is important to maintain some objectivity about what the data show," he added.
<p></p>
Prior to publication of a previous CEPR paper, "<a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=hBuju%2BdlDnLEeycBXQK9%2BoM4WcVzM89y" target="_new">Poverty Rates in Venezuela: Getting the Numbers Right</a>" in May 2006, the U.S. and international media, and magazines including Foreign Affairs and Foreign Policy, had widely disseminated the false assertion that poverty had worsened under the Chávez government. After CEPR's paper was published, several major newspapers ran retractions or corrections, and the vast majority of the media stopped repeating this particular falsehood.
