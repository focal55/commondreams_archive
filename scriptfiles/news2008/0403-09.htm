<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 3 - Tens of thousands of people around the world will hold public events on Friday, April 4, to raise awareness about the more than 70 countries contaminated with landmines, cluster bomb submunitions, and other deadly war remnants. The United Nations’ third annual International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action will kick off a month-long series of actions in support of a global cluster bombs ban. 

  <P></P>

Individuals and organizations in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to take action in their local communities during this month of action on cluster bombs that is organized by the U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines.

  <P></P>

Actions range from a house party in Arvada, CO to a de-mining fundraiser in a local Thai restaurant in Iowa City, IA to a film showing and letter-writing in Philadelphia, PA. Activists are also bringing the issue to their congregations. More than 130 faith leaders in Pennsylvania sent a letter to Senator Arlen Specter, urging him to co-sponsor legislation banning cluster bombs that pose a high risk to civilians.

  <P></P>

A global treaty process to ban cluster munitions is expected to conclude during meetings in Dublin, Ireland from May 19-30, 2008. The United States has refused to join these discussions.

  <P></P>

“We are outraged that the administration is refusing to participate in negotiations to prevent civilian casualties that result from cluster munitions,” said Lora Lumpe, coordinator of the USCBL.
 <P></P>
 

In addition to pushing for U.S. participation in global negotiations, USCBL is urging every member of Congress to cosponsor the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act (S.594/H.R.1755), which would prohibit the use of cluster munitions in civilian-populated areas.
