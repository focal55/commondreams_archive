<p>WASHINGTON, DC - April 29 - Farm and consumer groups today urged the Farm Bill conference
committee to preserve the livestock market and contract reforms in the
Livestock Title of the Senate version of the Farm Bill, especially in
light of a new expert panel report on the negative impacts of
industrial farm animal production.&nbsp; <br> <br> The report by the Pew
Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production released today touches
on one of the issues to be decided very soon by the Farm Bill
conference committee, concentrated market power in hands of a few large
meatpackers. The Commission’s report “Putting Meat on the Table: Industrial Farm Animal Production in America,” discusses the impact
that industrialized animal production has on the environment, public
health, rural communities, and farmers and includes a recommendation
that new policies to allow for a competitive marketplace in animal
agriculture be explored.&nbsp; <br> <br> “We were glad to see that the
commission acknowledged the issue of concentration and the negative
impact it has on the food system,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive
director of Food &amp; Water Watch. “But since antitrust regulations
are not working, we need Congress to tackle this issue now.”<br> <br>
The report states “if enforcing existing antitrust laws are not
effective in restoring competition, further legislative remedies should
be considered…” and identifies possible remedies such as more
transparent price reporting and limiting the ability of meat packers to
control supply before slaughter. Most of these measures, as well as
several others, are currently the subject of negotiation by the Farm
Bill conference committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br> “If JBS is allowed to buy
Smithfield Beef and National Beef Packing, the concentration in the
beef industry will be even worse that the Commission report suggests,”
said Mabel Dobbs of Weiser, Idaho who is chair of the Livestock
Committee for the Western Organization of Resource Councils. “We need
Congress to include the measures in the Senate’s livestock title
including the packer ban to give ranchers a chance to compete.”<br> <br>

The Senate version of the Farm Bill contains measures in the Livestock
Title that would prohibit meatpacker–owned livestock, prohibit
mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts, and end some of the most
abusive practices commonly used by meat companies in producer
contracts.&nbsp; <br> <br> “The poultry industry no longer has the regional
processing infrastructure we need for producers to remain independent,”
said Becky Ceartas, the program director for the Contract Agriculture
Reform Program at RAFI–USA. “Now poultry farmers have to sign a
contract that is not favorable to them if they want to raise poultry.
That’s why Congress needs to act now and include contract fairness
measures in the Farm Bill.”&nbsp;<!-- #EndEditable -->
