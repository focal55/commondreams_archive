WASHINGTON, DC - June 3 - To
give voice to the majority of American's desire to end the Iraq war,
women's peace group CODEPINK will present toy soldiers tagged with the
cost of war (in lives and dollars) to House Democratic leadership and
various members of Congress as they gear up for a second round of
voting on Bush's war supplemental. The message to be delivered with the
toy soldiers is that our real troops are not toys and Congress is
playing a deadly game of politicking- putting more of our troops in
harms way with each additional day they choose to fund the war in Iraq
and not a withdrawal.
  <br>
  <br>When: Tuesday, June 3, 2pm
  <br>Where: Press availability at New Jersey and Independence Ave SE
  <br>Great visuals!
  <br>
  <br>Over
a dozen women from around New York State have traveled to DC this week
and are staying at the CODEPINK Activist House near Capitol Hill to
meet with their representatives on war funding, impeachment and
saber-rattling at Iran. A mother whose son is to be redeployed to Iraq
joins them with her very personalized message of "Stop the funding,
stop the war, bring our nations' sons and daughters home!"
  <br>

  <br>"Dead soldiers won't vote but their mothers will! Our leaders need
to fund a withdrawal not a war, bring my son home and take care of him
when he gets here" states Cynthia Benjamin, mother of an active duty
army captain being redeployed to Iraq this year.
  <br>
  <br>Members of the NY delegation are available for interview all week- Call Dana at (202)422-8624 for more info
