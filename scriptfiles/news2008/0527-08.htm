MINNEAPOLIS - May 27 - At the National Conference for Media Reform, hosted by Free Press on June 6-8 in Minneapolis, a distinguished series of speakers and panels will stress the need for open Internet policies that bring affordable, high-speed access to everyone.

</p>
<p>The National Conference for Media Reform comes as policymakers in Washington face critical policy decisions that will shape the future of the Internet. Bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would help preserve Net Neutrality -- the longstanding principle that prevents cable and phone companies from blocking users' access to Internet content. And the FCC is investigating Comcast for allegations that the cable giant is blocking Internet traffic over its network.  

</p><p>"Unprecedented public participation in the debate over the future of the Internet has had a huge impact -- but the fight isn't over," said <b>Josh Silver</b>, executive director of Free Press. "At the National Conference for Media Reform, we will arm ourselves for the battle ahead when phone and cable lobbyists renew their efforts to shut down the open Internet."
