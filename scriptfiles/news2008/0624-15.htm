WASHINGTON - June 24 -  Consumer organizations working to halt the privatization of California’s water resources won a small victory yesterday when the California State Senate’s Appropriations Committee voted in favor of AB 2275, a bill to enforce stricter disclosure standards for water-bottling companies. AB 2275 would require businesses licensed to bottle, vend, haul or distribute bottled water to report the source of the water as either from a well, lake, river or spring; the location of the source and whether that source is privately or publicly owned. The bill will next go before the full Senate for vote.</p>
<p>“We applaud the Appropriations Committee’s support of water bottling disclosure and their commitment to protecting California’s natural resources from corporate control,” said Wenonah Hauter, Executive Director of Food &amp; Water Watch. “California's constitution states that water belongs to all of us and should be managed as a public trust. As water becomes an increasingly scarce resource, we have a right to know how much of it is being taken for private profit.”<br><br>The advancement of AB 2775 comes at precisely the right time as Nestle attempts to open a bottled water plant in McCloud, California. If approved, the plant would take millions of gallons of water from the community a year.&nbsp; <br><br>“The California Senate should vote to pass AB 2275 and Governor Schwarzenegger should ratify it,” said Hauter. <br><br>
