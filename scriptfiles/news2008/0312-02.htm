<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 12 - Today, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) called on FBI Direct Robert S. Mueller to open an investigation into whether White House officials obstructed justice by destroying documents relevant to the criminal investigation into the leak of Valerie Plame Wilson's covert CIA identity. CREW's request relies in large part on evidence recently disclosed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which documents that for the period September 30 through October 6, 2003, there were no e-mails for the entire Office of the Vice President (OVP) on either the White House servers or on a back-up tape created on October 21, 2003, with the exception of e-mails that had not yet been erased from individual OVP employee mailboxes. According to a declaration submitted by the Office of Administration’s Chief Information Officer in CREW v. EOP, the practice at the White House since 2003 has been to make copies of all e-mails through a journaling function of Microsoft Exchange and store those journaled e-mails in .pst files on White House servers. Yet when OA employees sought to find OVP e-mails in response to a subpoena from Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, there were no journaled e-mails on either the servers or a back-up tape for a critical period just after the Department of Justice had opened its criminal investigation and the White House had been ordered to preserve all potentially relevant documents.
<P></P>
On February 4, 2008, CREW had asked Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the disappearance of millions of White House e-mails, but the Department disregarded that request, instead sending a form letter suggesting that CREW contact the FBI with any information about possible crimes. Previously, CREW had brought evidence concerning former Rep. Mark Foley's (R-FL) possible sexual exploitation of teenage pages to the FBI, but the agency failed to investigate the matter and later lied about the evidence CREW had provided, as an internal investigation by DOJ's inspector general confirmed. As a result, CREW has little confidence that the FBI will take today’s request seriously either.
<P></P>
CREW’s chief counsel, Anne Weismann said today, “There is now credible evidence that someone in the White House may have obstructed justice by destroying documents related to the leak of Ms. Wilson’s identity. Confronted with this evidence, the FBI, as the nation’s top law enforcement authority, has an obligation to investigate.”<br>
