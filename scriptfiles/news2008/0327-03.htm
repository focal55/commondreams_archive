<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 27 - As Zimbabwe’s
presidential elections draw near, Africa Action expresses its solidarity
with the people of Zimbabwe in their efforts to build a free,
democratic, and socially just nation. Africa Action’s Briggs Bomba is
currently in Zimbabwe on a fact-finding mission. His observations
indicate that while there has been far less outright violence than in
past elections and turnout is likely to be high, the democratic process
is being undermined by technical subversion of proper electoral
procedure, intimidation and coup threats by state security agencies and
other violations of political rights. Briggs describes the mood as
“pregnant with political tension and possibilities.”
<P></P>
Africa Action calls on the international community to support the
efforts of Zimbabwean pro-democracy civil society to achieve a peaceful
and just resolution to this political crisis and in order for leadership
to address the related economic crisis. However, because of the lack of
credibility the U.S. holds with Zimbabwe’s people, Africa Action does
not recommend U.S. leadership in the international response to the
elections at this time.
<P></P>
“Regardless of what transpires on and immediately after March 29,
U.S.-led intervention in Zimbabwe would only make things more difficult
for pro-democracy activists on the ground,” said Gerald LeMelle, Africa
Action’s Executive Director. “President Bush’s aggressive unilateral
stance against the Mugabe government strengthens the regime’s assertion
that Western imperialist forces are to blame for Zimbabwe’s economic
turmoil.”
<P></P>
Several scenarios could emerge from Saturday’s vote, as Briggs Bomba
explains. “If Mugabe loses the election but is declared the winner,
popular anger will be intense. Whether or not this frustration
translates into any form of mass political action or just a drawn-out
legal challenge of the results will depend on the decisions of
opposition leadership. If Mugabe loses and Morgan Tsvangirai or Simba
Makoni is declared a winner, there is a risk of a coup by hardline
Zanu-PF supporters.”
<P></P>
Africa Action notes that if violence erupts – via a coup or by
disenchanted, fed-up voters – the U.S. should support the African Union
and regional bodies in mediating a peaceful solution. Despite the
temptation to recreate Kenya’s recent power-sharing agreement, mediators
should approach Zimbabwe’s political challenges with caution and with a
flexible strategy that balances the need for peace and security with
electoral justice. While a power-sharing arrangement may turn out to be
a practical solution, the international community should avoid
encouraging another precedent where tarnished African elections result
in all parties gaining access to power, regardless of how the people
actually voted.
