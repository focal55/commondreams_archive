 WASHINGTON, DC - June 11 -The Grassroots Netroots Alliance (GNA), a project of The Organic Consumers Fund, was launched today. GNA sees itself as complementary, yet also an alternative, to MoveOn.org and other pre-existing progressive, radical, and libertarian online networks. "Millions of Americans at the "netroots," those drawing their information and inspiration from the open sources of the Internet, are connecting the dots between the burning issues. A potential new majority are realizing we must move beyond "business as usual" and tepid reform, uniting our heretofore fragmented forces and communities into a qualitatively more powerful current," according to Ronnie Cummins, GNA Director.
<P></P>
GNA aims to take activism beyond single-issue groups to a multi-issue platform that stimulates local alliance building and grassroots action, focused on pressuring the politicians, and pushing through legislation in both national and local legislatures that will address demands around five important issue areas. These issue areas are:  1. War, Peace, and Constitutional Liberties; 2. Climate Crisis; 3. Health; 4. Economics & Trade; and 5. Democracy. GNA's demands are: 1. Get Out of Iraq; 2. Stop Global Warming and Green the Economy; 3. Repeal the Patriot Act and Restore Constitutional Liberties; and 4. Implement Universal Health Care, Economic Justice, Election and Media Reform, Civil Rights, Corporate Accountability, and Drug Policy Reform.
<P></P>
According to GNA Director Cummins, "The crazed neo-con project for world domination, aided and abetted by profit-obsessed multinational corporations; countered feebly by the 'loyal opposition' of centrist Democrats, single-issue public interest groups, and top-down 'progressive' organizations like MoveOn, have brought us to the precipice. Radical crises demand radical remedies. Millions now understand it's time to take it to the streets and the suites of the corporations and the politicians. Move over MoveOn. The grassroots are coming."
<P></P>
GNA's first major project is a comprehensive 2008 Candidate Survey, which concerned people around the country will send to their elected representatives and candidates for office at the local, county, state and federal levels. The Survey is s a multi-issue questionnaire for candidates and elected officials that asks politicians to consider 40 important policy proposals drawn from  a diverse coalition of progressive advocacy groups.  The Survey can be found here: <a href="http://grassrootsnetroots.org/2008platform.cfm" target="_new">http://grassrootsnetroots.org/2008platform.cfm</a>. <!-- #EndEditable -->
