WASHINGTON, DC - May 28 -  Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, gave a speech today announcing new global warming legislation.
 <p></p>
Below is a statement by Alden Meyer, strategy and policy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists:
  <p></p>
"Chairman Markey has been a long-time champion of effective, economically sound environmental policies. This bill demonstrates once again the congressman's serious commitment to solving the climate crisis.
  <p></p>
"Most important, Markey's bill builds on the best practices of cap-and-trade programs and sets a strong framework to dramatically cut global warming pollution. It would auction 100 percent of allowances by 2020, making polluters fully accountable for their emissions. At the same time, it would reinvest revenue from those auctions into a new green economy, driving job growth and pollution reductions.
  <p></p>
"Its short-term target will get us on the path toward the long-term reductions that scientists say will be necessary to prevent the worst consequences of global warming: at least 80 percent cuts in global warming pollution below 2000 levels by 2050.  We look forward to working with Chairman Markey and other champions in the House to pass strong, science-based global warming legislation."
