WASHINGTON, DC - June 23 - The American Humanist Association today
filed a legal brief in the U.S. Supreme Court case Pleasant Grove City, UT,
et al. v. Summon. The amicus brief argued against allowing the Summon
religious group to display its aphorisms in the same public park where a Ten
Commandments monument appears. Rather, the American Humanist Association
urged the Supreme Court to disallow religious speech on the government-owned
property entirely and to remove the Ten Commandments monument.
<p></p>
"It's a question of fairness," said Roy Speckhardt, executive director of
the American Humanist Association. "If you allow one religious display, to
be fair you must allow them all. But government shouldn't be in the
religious display business, and there are too many religions to be able to
do that anyway. Churches, mosques and synagogues should erect their
own displays on their own property and let the government worry about
governance."
<p></p>
The case brings up issues 1st Amendment concerns of government endorsement
of religion. According to the AHA's legal brief, "By itself, the text of the
Ten Commandments sends an overwhelmingly religious message, and the context
in which the monument is displayed here only heightens the effect of
government endorsement of this message."
<p></p>
The brief also addresses the legal question of equal access. "The display of
the Ten Commandments sends the message to nonadherents of Judeo-Christian
religions that they are not full members of the political community ...
Although the Supreme Court has characterized a nearly identical Ten
Commandments monument as nothing more than 'acknowledgement' of the role
played by religion, there is no principled or neutral way to decide which
beliefs are deserving of the government's 'acknowledgment' and which are
not."
<p></p>
"We had two purposes for writing this brief," said Bob Ritter, coordinator
of the Appignani Humanist Legal Center, the legal arm of the American
Humanist Association. "Our first priority was to inform the court that
public parks are not public forums for speech. Although monuments erected on
public land may have been donated by a private donor, by virtue of being on
government-owned land such displays represent government-endorsed speech and
not the free speech of the donor. Second, we wanted to demonstrate that the
Establishment clause prohibits the government from displaying inherently
religious monuments."
<p></p>
Other organizations signing on to the Amicus Brief include The American
Ethical Union, Atheist Alliance International, the Institute for Humanist
Studies, the Secular Student Alliance, the Society for Humanistic Judaism,
and the Unitarian Universalist Association.
