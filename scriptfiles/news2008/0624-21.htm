WASHINGTON - June 24 - SEIU, the nation’s largest and fasting-growing union, announced today a general election campaign that includes unprecedented activity by more members than any election in SEIU’s history. Nurses, child care and home care workers, janitors, security officers and other SEIU members across the country are already talking to voters and hitting the streets in key states and races across the country.
 <p></p>
“More than 100,000 SEIU members will be volunteering their time to elect a pro-worker majority in Congress and elect Barack Obama as our next president,” said Secretary-Treasurer Anna Burger. “They will reach out to voters in their communities with a clear message about which candidate will end the war in Iraq, ensure guaranteed affordable health care for everyone and build a new American Dream for workers.”
  <p></p>
SEIU’s political campaign includes:
 <p></p>
    * A budget of $85 million for this election, targeting swing states for Obama’s presidential campaign as well as important gubernatorial, Senatorial and House races. Some of the states include: CO, IA, MN, NC, NH, NM, OH, PA, VA and WI.
  <br>
  * Paid advertising and direct mail campaigns throughout the country.
   <br>
 * Registering voters, contacting voters at the door and over the phone, organizing rallies and campaign events.
   <br>
 * An historic presence at the Democratic and Republican party conventions.
   <br>
 * Extensive outreach to voters on McCain’s record of putting working families last.
   <br>
 * “Road to American Health Care” bus tour that is traveling through swing states all summer and ending at the Democratic and Republican conventions.
    <br>
* “Promote the Vote” campaigns to insure all eligible voters cast their ballot and that their vote is counted.
   <br>
 * Targeted outreach in key areas to hold House and Senate members accountable for their votes on health care.
   <br>
 * “Walk A Day In My Shoes” with gubernatorial and Senate candidates in key states with candidates spending time on the job and in the home of an SEIU worker.
    <br>
* A $10 million accountability campaign that will begin on November 5 by holding elected officials to their promises on health care and strengthening the middle class. 
 <p></p>

“We are running the largest and most aggressive political operation in our union’s history for this campaign,” said Burger. “When working families do better, the country does better. Our members will use their voices to push a strong agenda for working families: new jobs that pay a living wage, help for families facing foreclosures and struggling with higher gas prices and grocery bills, and retirement with dignity.”
  <p></p>
SEIU’s electoral targets will grow and shift throughout the summer to ensure members’ time, energy and resources are maximized.
  <p></p>
“We are committed to working hard every day through Election Day and beyond to keep the pressure on our leaders until we create a new American Dream for working people,” said Burger.<br>
<br>
