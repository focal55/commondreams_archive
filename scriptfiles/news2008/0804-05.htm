WASHINGTON - August 4 - In light of Center for Science in the Public Interest newest investigation "Kids' Meals: Obesity on the Menu," Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has released a short backgrounder on Richard Berman, who founded and serves as the executive director of numerous tax-exempt front groups while also running his own consulting firm, Berman and Associates. One of those organizations is the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), which works at the behest of the fast food, alcohol and tobacco industries. Berman often provides “analysis” for studies such as the one released today. CREW is providing this information in order for the public to better understand Berman’s many hats and funding sources.<!-- #EndEditable -->
