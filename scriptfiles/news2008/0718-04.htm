WASHINGTON - July 18 -  Member groups of United for Peace and Justice will hold actions across the United States July 19-21 to press Congress to take action to prevent war with Iran.
<p></p>
In a major policy shift, the Bush administration will send a senior official to participate in international talks with Iran this weekend. This marks a retreat from the previous White House position that it would not talk face-to-face with Iran until Tehran suspended its nuclear enrichment program. It shows that pressure to diplomatically engage Iran rather than threaten military attack is making a difference.
<p></p>
From July 19-21, groups around the country are participating in the Days of Action Against War on Iran. Monday, July 21, will also be a national "Call Congress Day." This will coincide with a lobby day in Washington, DC, organized by Peace Action.
<p></p>
"This is no time for complacency. Rather, it's time to make our call for NO WAR even louder. And it's time for members of Congress who have said they oppose a third war to tell us what they are going to do to stop it," said Leslie Cagan, National Coordinator of United for Peace and Justice.
<p></p>
Before the decision to participate in the international talks, we'd seen a new escalation of threats from the Bush administration and Israel to attack Iran before President Bush leaves office. The London Sunday Times reported that President Bush had told the Israeli government that he may be prepared to approve a military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities if negotiations with Iran break down. Meanwhile, more than 200 members of Congress have co-sponsored a resolution (HConRes 362) calling on the Bush administration to prohibit Iran from importing gas, an action that would require a military blockade of Iran to carry out.
