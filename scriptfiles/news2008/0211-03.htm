<p>BERKELEY, CA- February 11 -<strong><br>
  <br>
  When: </strong>Monday, February 11, 7pm until 7pm on Tuesday February 12th, when the Berkeley City Council meets.
  <br>
  <br><strong>Where: </strong>Maudelle Shirek City
Hall, 2134 Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Berkeley. (at Allston Way, 4
blocks from the Downtown Berkeley BART).
  <br>
  <br>

Members of the women’s peace group CODEPINK launched a campaign to
close the Berkeley Marine Recruiting Station. The pro-war forces,
represented by the group Move America Forward, are mobilizing to
descend on Berkeley on Tuesday, February 12, starting at 5am! They plan
to spend the day attempting to intimidate the peace-loving City and
City Council.
  <br>
  <br>
“This struggle is not about the Marines as individuals. It’s about the
occupation of Iraq. It’s about recruiting our youth to be those
occupying forces in Iraq. It’s about the 1.2 million dead Iraqis, the
3,950 dead U.S. soldiers, the trillions of dollars of our taxpayer
money,” states Medea Benjamin cofounder of CODEPINK. “It’s about
respecting the right of the people of Berkeley to say no to war!”
  <br>
  <br>
The peace group will also hold a press conference at 12pm on February
12 with members of the Berkeley City Council. Both pro- and anti-war
forces will be at the City Council meeting that starts 7pm (when the
peace-in vigil ends). 
  <br>

  <em>CODEPINK is the national women's
peace group that has most recently garnered international attention
when its members confronted Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice with red
painted hands to represent the Iraqi blood on the hands of the US
Administration. Started in the lead-up to the Iraq war, CODEPINK has
inspired thousands of women throughout the United States and the world
to make the color pink synonymous with political rabble rousing. Visit
