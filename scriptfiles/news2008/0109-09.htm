<p>WASHINGTON - January 9 -Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, issued the following statement announcing the release of a new profile on presidential candidate John McCain's record on a woman's right to choose.</p>
<p>"Sen. John McCain's first place win in the New Hampshire primary, much like Mike Huckabee's win in the Iowa caucuses, means there could be a presidential nominee who is arguably more anti-choice than even President Bush," Keenan said.&nbsp; "Independent and Republican pro-choice women form a critical voting bloc.&nbsp; We know that, when these women learn about Sen. McCain's anti-choice position, they will vote for the pro-choice candidate, regardless of their party affiliation."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new profile shows that this so-called "maverick" is nothing more than a far-right extremist.&nbsp; Not only has Sen. McCain called for the overturn of Roe v. Wade, he has cast dangerous votes for divisive anti-choice federal court nominees, including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Most recently, he voted to confirm Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, both of whom, with Justice Thomas, joined a majority opinion last spring that effectively rolled back a key tenant of Roe – that women's health must always be paramount.&nbsp; In addition to his documented hostility towards safe, legal abortion, Sen. McCain has repeatedly voted against commonsense family-planning measures that would reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and therefore reduce the need for abortion.</p>
<p>Following McCain's win in New Hampshire, NARAL Pro-Choice America is contacting hundreds of thousands of its member-activists highlighting McCain's anti-choice record.&nbsp; </p>
