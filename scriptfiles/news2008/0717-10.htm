WASHINGTON - July 17 -  In a major effort to move America to a clean energy future,  former Vice President Al Gore will today call on our nation to  produce electricity from sources free of global warming pollution, a move that would put us on a path to a stronger U.S. economy, protect jobs and dramatically reduce dangerous air pollution . Gore, winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, is calling on the nation to do this within ten years.
 <P></P>
The following is a statement by David Hawkins, Director of Climate Programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC):
 <P></P>
"Finally, a clear and compelling call to do what is both possible and essential to help solve the climate crisis. Al Gore's call for a truly clean electric power fleet in a decade is the scale of action we need to break the back of global warming. With a prompt action plan from Congress, including a firm limit on global warming pollution, America can reach this goal in time to help the world avoid the worst impacts of a disrupted climate."
<P></P>
The Natural Resources Defense Council is a national, nonprofit organization of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment. Founded in 1970, NRDC has 1.2 million members and online activists, served from offices in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Beijing. <!-- #EndEditable -->
