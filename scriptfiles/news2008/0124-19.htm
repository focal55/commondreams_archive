<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 24 -  As Republican presidential candidates prepare to debate in Florida, League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski issued this statement urging debate and talk show hosts to question the candidates on global warming:
<p></p>
“As voters in South Carolina, Florida and around the country prepare to vote in the next presidential primaries, we are still waiting for debate and talk show hosts to question the candidates on their plans to address global warming. Time is running out, and voters demand and deserve to know where the candidates stand on this urgent threat.
<p></p>
“During last weekend’s TV talk shows and Monday night’s Democratic candidates debate, not one question was asked about global climate change.
<p></p>
“In fact, according to LCV’s running tally at <a href="http://www.whataretheywaitingfor.com/" target="_new">www.whataretheywaitingfor.com</a>, in 170 television interviews and debates with the presidential candidates, TV’s top political reporters have asked 2,938 questions, but mentioned global warming only four times and asked only 27 questions related to the issue.
<p></p>
“The Republican candidates are debating tonight in Florida, a state that scientists say could be devastated by the effects of climate change, and where the Republican governor has taken the lead by pushing for a mandatory state program to reduce emissions.
<p></p>
“The candidates themselves are bringing up the issue on the campaign trail and in their debates, but the voters need clarity, and it is the responsibility of good journalists to press the candidates to detail their positions on the greatest threat facing our nation and the planet. We urge the television reporters and debate hosts to join voters in probing the candidates’ views on this critical issue.”  </i><br>
