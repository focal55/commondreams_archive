<p>SAN FRANCISCO - May 7 - The FBI has withdrawn an unconstitutional national security letter (NSL) issued to the Internet Archive after a legal challenge from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union. As the result of a settlement agreement, the FBI lifted the NSL's gag and agreed to the unsealing of the case, finally allowing the Archive’s founder to speak out for the first time about his battle against the records demand.
<P></P>
Representatives from EFF, the ACLU, and the Internet Archive will speak about this previously secret lawsuit for the first time at 2PM EDT/ 11AM PDT. The teleconference number is (800) 762-7308 and the title is “ACLU EFF Teleconference.”
<P></P>
NSLs are secretly issued by the government to obtain access to personal customer records from Internet service providers, financial institutions, and credit reporting agencies, among other companies. In almost all cases, recipients of NSLs are forbidden, or "gagged," from disclosing that they have received the letters. The Internet Archive fought this NSL because it exceeded the FBI's limited authority to issue NSLs to libraries. This is the first case to assert the protections for libraries that Congress instituted in 2006.
