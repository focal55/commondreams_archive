TLAXIACO, OAXACA - June 14 - June 14, 2008 at approximately 2:00 p.m. a group of one hundred paramilitaries commanded by Maximo Garcia Garcia and Eucario Morales Arias issued an ultimátum to the commander of the State Investigative Team.  The armed men told the Investigative Team that if the team of 7 individuals did not leave within the hour, there would be physical reprisals. 
<p></p>
The State  Investigative Team was in the community of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan to implement the ´precautionary measures´ granted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for the physical protection of the community of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan.  The State Investigative Team came to the community on Wednesday and the State Preventive Police left. 
<p></p>
The expulsion of the State Investigative Team from the community creates a grave risk to the lives of the community residents.  The government of Mexico has refused to implement the required ´precautionary measures´ granted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  The government of Mexico has refused to send the Federal Preventive Police to the community of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan.   
<p></p>
The current grave situation stems from the assassinations of April 30 when three indigenous leaders from the community were assassinated.  The three men, Melecio Martinez Robles, Inocencio Medina Bernabé, and Gustavo Castaneda Martinez were killed by paramilitaries because they opposed the sale of community land. 
<p></p>
The Center for Human Rights and Advice for Indigenous Peoples demands that the Federal Government of Mexico implement the necessary security measures to protect the people of Santo Domingo Ixcatlan.  Specifically, the Federal Government of Mexico must send the Federal Preventive Police and the Army to Santo Domingo Ixcatlan.  At this time there has been no concrete response from the government regarding the obligatory ´precautionary measures´ ordered by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights. <!-- #EndEditable -->
