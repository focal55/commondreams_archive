<p></p><p>High-speed Internet, or "broadband," is becoming a crucial public necessity -- with almost limitless social, economic and educational potential. Technology plays a key role in almost every domestic political issue. But America's growing digital divide has cost the United States its claim to global Internet leadership. The consequences of America's failure to remain competitive are severe, and the need to address the problem is urgent. </p><p>"The Internet increasingly affects every aspect of our economy, our political process and our private lives," Congressman Doyle said today. "As vice chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, I have been working to ensure that federal telecom policy truly benefits American consumers. That's why I appreciate the FCC's willingness to hold field hearings in cities like Pittsburgh where it can get a real feel for what Americans want their digital future to look like." </p><p>The Census Bureau estimates that less than 50 percent of homes in Pennsylvania are subscribed to broadband. </p><p>"It is unacceptable that the country that invented the Internet still has so many communities stranded on the wrong side of the digital divide," said <strong>Timothy Karr</strong>, campaign director of Free Press. "Until we make it a national priority to bring affordable, high-speed Internet to all Americans, the situation will only get worse. This forum is an important opportunity for Pennsylvanians to weigh in on how to get our digital future back on track." </p><p>The hearing will feature two expert panels, followed by an "open microphone" session for the public to offer testimony on a first-come, first-served basis. </p><p>Read the FCC's official announcement and agenda: <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-283761A1.pdf" target="_new">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-283761A1.pdf </a></p>
