 July 2 - Netroots Nation organizers announced announced today that Speaker Nancy Pelosi will participate in a Saturday morning keynote session: "Ask the Speaker."
<P></P>
The event empowers citizens to engage America's current House leader and the first ever female Speaker in substantive discussion about current issues, the legislative process, and how citizens can participate in their government. One of Netroots Nation's goals, organizers say, is to facilitate in-person interaction between political leaders and the progressive community.
<P></P>
"The internet has changed the face of politics and democracy in so many ways," said Pelosi. "I am looking forward to participating in Netroots Nation, where many of those behind these breakthroughs will all be under one roof."
<P></P>
The 9 a.m. session will be moderated by Netroots Nation executive director Gina Cooper and Dr. Jeffrey Feldman, blogger and author of several books.
<P></P>
Netroots Nation 2008 will feature panels led by national and international experts, including keynotes with Gov. Howard Dean, Lawrence Lessig and Van Jones; identity, issue and regional caucuses; prominent political, issue and policy-oriented speakers; and the most concentrated gathering of progressive bloggers to date.
<P></P>
Netroots Nation rebranded in August of 2007 in an effort to more accurately reflect the makeup of its audience and mission of implementing programs that teach and empower Netroots communities to affect change in the public sphere. The 2007 gathering last August included a Presidential Leadership Forum that drew seven of the eight Democratic candidates.
<P></P>
Ask the Speaker is open to the media.
