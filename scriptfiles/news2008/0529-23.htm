WASHINGTON, DC - May 29 -<br>

<b><a href="mailto:dkass@hmieast.com">VINCENT BUGLIOSI</a></b><br>
Bugliosi is a former prosecutor who successfully prosecuted 21 murder convictions without a single loss. His previous best-selling books include <i>Helter Skelter</i> about the Charles Manson case, which he successfully prosecuted.<br>
<br>
He has authored the just-released <i><a href="http://www.prosecutionofbush.com">The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder</a></i>. Bugliosi said today: "I have not had an opportunity to read Mr. McClellan's book, but I read a quote from it in the <i>New York Times</i> in which McClellan says 'Iraq was a series of strategic blunders.' If this is his position, he and I couldn't be further apart. A blunder is a mistake. Mistakes are by definition innocent and never criminal. In my book I present incontrovertible evidence that George W. Bush knowingly and deliberately took this nation to war on a lie, under false pretenses, and is therefore guilty of murder. So my position is diametrically opposed to Mr. McClellan's.<br>

<br>
"In taking us to war in Iraq, not only were George Bush's allegation that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to the security of this country and his unmistakable allegation by implication that Hussein was involved in 9/11, false, but also and much more importantly, Bush knew that both allegations were untrue.<br>
<br>
"In his first nationally televised address on the Iraqi crisis on October 7, 2002, President Bush told millions of unsuspecting Americans the exact opposite of what the CIA and 15 other U.S. intelligence agencies had told him on October 1, just six days earlier, in a top-secret, classified report -- that Hussein was not an imminent threat to this country and would only use force against us if he feared he was in imminent danger of an attack on him by us. This was a monumental lie by Bush to the nation and the world."<br>

<b><a href="mailto:robrtparry@aol.com">ROBERT PARRY</a></b><br>
Parry's latest book is <i><a href="http://neckdeepbook.com">Neck Deep: The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush</a></i> and was written with two of his sons, Sam and Nat. Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and Newsweek.<br>
<br>
He just wrote a piece titled "Surprise, Surprise: Bush Lied," which states: "Some may view ex-White House press secretary Scott McClellan's new book as vindication for those who took grief -- accused of 'derangement,' 'treason' and a bunch of less-printable things -- for calling George W. Bush a liar over the past eight years. But the more troubling point is that there has been little improvement in the Washington political/media structure that failed to call Bush out on his lies in a timely fashion.<br>

<br>
"In Iraq alone, the consequences for that dereliction of duty include more than 4,000 U.S. dead along with hundreds of thousands of slain Iraqis and possibly trillions of taxpayer dollars wasted. Though Bush's White House and his Republican allies may stand out as the principal villains in this tragic story, a large share of the blame also must fall on accommodating Democrats and careerists in the Washington press corps. They protected their political flanks and their nice salaries by playing along. ...<br>
<br>
"It also wasn't hard to figure out that President Bush was a brazen liar. ... Bush began rewriting the history [after the Iraq invasion] by telling reporters that Saddam Hussein was the one who 'chose' war by barring United Nations inspectors. 'We gave him [Saddam Hussein] a chance to allow the inspectors in, and he wouldn't let them in. And, therefore, after a reasonable request, we decided to remove him from power,' Bush told reporters on July 14, 2003. Facing no serious challenge to this lie from the White House press corps, Bush continued repeating it in varied forms as part of his public litany for defending the invasion. ... "<br>
