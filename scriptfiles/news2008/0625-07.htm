NEW YORK - June 25 - What is lacking in today's peace movement? How can grassroots organizers turn popular antiwar sentiment into broad-based action? What strategies and tactics should be employed, and how should the antiwar movement relate to the elections?
 <p></p>
The War Resisters League recently conducted a Listening Process, asking 90 grassroots organizers from across the county to address these and other questions and to reflect on the state of the antiwar movement in the United States. The new 40-page special issue of WIN magazine features their reflections and insights.
<p></p>
Interviewees include organizers and activists from diverse organizations - from local efforts like Coalition Against Militarism in Our Schools in southern California; to constituency-based organizations like U.S. Labor Against the War, Iraq Veterans Against the War, and September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows; to national coalitions like United for Peace and Justice.  Some interviewees work primarily on peace and antiwar issues, while others focus mainly on gender justice, labor, racial justice, the environment, or community issues.
<p></p>
The interviews explore constraints that the movement faces, as well as openings; how to build a more multiracial, cross-class and broad-based movement; the relevancy of nonviolence; the role of soldiers, veterans and military families; and many other questions.
