<p>WASHINGTON, DC - January 30 - A new report by the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm
Animal Production (<a href="http://www.pcifap.org" target="_new">www.pcifap.org</a>) documents the perils of antibiotic
use in factory farms and the many strains of antibiotic-resistant
E-Coli, Salmonella, Camphylobacter, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), and other bacteria that these facilities cause.
<p></p>
The report release comes a few days after Tyson Foods and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed on a new label for their
chickens raised without antibiotics:  "Chicken raised without
antibiotics that impact antibiotic resistance in humans."  Tyson
announced in June, 2007, that it would stop feeding antibiotics
important in human medicine to their chickens, a move that advocated
hailed as "a great step forward."  But no other large meat producers
have followed suit.
<p></p>
"The added voice of the Pew Commissioners to that of the American
Medical Association and the Infectious Diseases Society of America shows
the need to stop factory farms from squandering the effectiveness of our
antibiotic supply," said Richard Wood, Steering Committee Chair of the
Keep Antibiotics Working coalition.  "But lasting change will only come
when the U.S. government decides to act.  We hope that the Pew report
will help spark that step."
<p></p>
The heavy use of antibiotics in industrialized livestock operations can
select for resistant bacteria, such as MRSA.  The <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_new">Union of Concerned
Scientists</a> estimates that 70% of all the antibiotics and related drugs
used in the United States are used as feed additives for chicken, hogs,
and beef cattle.  The new report details the many links between farm
antibiotic use and the spread of resistant infections in humans.
<p></p>
Despite a long awareness of the link between farm antibiotic use and
resistance in humans, the United States still allows the routine and
unnecessary use of critically important drugs in farm animals for growth
promotion. The United States also fails to adequately monitor
antimicrobial resistance in farm animals.  Even the recent media
coverage on MRSA being found in Canadian and European livestock has not
prompted the US to check its own livestock to ensure food safety.
<p></p>
Proposed federal legislation would phase out the use of antibiotics that
are important in human medicine as animal feed additives within two
years.  The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act is
sponsored by Senate Health Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and
Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Susan Collins (R-ME), Sherrod Brown
(D-OH) and Jack Reed (D-RI) in the Senate (S. 549) and Rep. Louise
Slaughter (D-NY), the only microbiologist in Congress, and 34 other
House members in the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R. 962).
<p></p>
The Keep Antibiotics Working Coalition has recently highlighted a
half-dozen scientific studies that clearly demonstrate the escalating
health threat:
<p></p>
 * Clinical Infectious Diseases published a study this month showing
that patients in a Dutch hospital who were exposed to pigs or veal
calves (mostly farmers) had 3-fold increase in risk for MRSA infections.
<p></p>

* The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging
Infectious Diseases published a study in December linking a new strain
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) once found only in
pigs to more than 20 percent of all human MRSA infections in the
Netherlands
<p></p>
* Veterinary Microbiology published a study in October that found MRSA
prevalent in Canadian pig farms and pig farmers, pointing to animal
agriculture as a source of the deadly bacteria.
<p></p>
* Applied and Environmental Microbiology published a study in August
that linked the routine use of the antibiotic tetracycline, popular in
swine production, to the presence of antibiotics resistance genes in
groundwater.
<p></p>
* Journal of Food Protection published a study in August by USDA
researchers showing that feeding chickens the antibiotic tylosin to
promote growth - not to treat disease - greatly increases the number of
erythromycin-resistant Campylobacter on chicken carcasses.
<p></p>
* Emerging Infectious Diseases published a study in 2006 documenting
U.S. veterinarians as carriers of MRSA. In a 2005 survey of attendees at
an international veterinary convention in Baltimore, MD, who were tested
for MRSA found that of the 27 who tested positive, 23 were from the
United States.
