NEW JERSEY - June 23 - GEORGE CARLIN, acerbic and insightful social critic  and comedian died
Sunday at age 71.  Carlin was especially famous for his "Seven Words You
Can Never Say on Television" routine, and his edgy style of witty
commentary that made him one of the nation's funniest and most
controversial performers.
<P></P>
But for a growing segment of the American population -- the 13% of
"godless" Americans who profess no religious beliefs -- Carlin was
especially heroic.  George Carlin was an Atheist who often eviscerated
religious dogmatism in his special, humorous style.   Of religion he said:
<P></P>
"When it comes to bullshit, big time, major league bullshit, you have to
stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated
claims, religion.  No contest.  No contest. Religion.  Religion easily
has the greatest bullshit story ever told.  Think about it.  Religion
has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in
the sky who watches everything you do every minute of the day.  And the
invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to
do.  And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full
of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will
send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry for
ever and ever 'til the end of time!"
<P></P>
Frank Zindler, Acting President of American Atheists said that Carlin
will be especially missed by Atheists, freethinkers and even open-minded
religious believers.  "Carlin took on all of the religious shibboleths
of our age in a way that made people laugh and think at the same time.
We've lost a great comedian and a wonderful human being."
