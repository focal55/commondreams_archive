<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 25 - The bodies of nearly all Americans are contaminated
with a sunscreen chemical that has been linked to allergies, hormone
disruption, and cell damage, according to a new study from the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC). A companion study from the Mt. Sinai School of
Medicine found that the same chemical is linked to low birth weight in baby
girls whose mothers are exposed during pregnancy.
<P></P>
The chemical, oxybenzone, is widely used in sunscreens. It was last reviewed
for safety in the 1970¹s but since then significant new evidence has been
published on its toxicity and pervasive exposure. A recent review by the
European Union found insufficient data to determine whether oxybenzone in
sunscreen is safe for consumers.
<P></P>
³These studies are the latest in a long list of reasons the Food and Drug
Administration must thoroughly review the safety of all chemicals used in
sunscreens Americans use every day,² said Rebecca Sutton, a scientist with
EWG. ³FDA must do what it promised 30 years ago:  Enact permanent,
enforceable federal safety standards for sunscreens so consumers can get the
best and safest sun protection.²
<P></P>
Nearly 600 sunscreens sold in the U.S. contain oxybenzone, including
products by Hawaiian Tropic, Coppertone, and Banana Boat, according to an
analysis of ingredient labels by EWG. And, although oxybenzone is most
common in sunscreen, companies also use the toxic chemical in at least 567
other personal care products, including lip balm, lipstick, moisturizers and
fragrance for women.
<P></P>
EWG research shows that 84 percent of 910 name-brand sunscreen products
offer inadequate protection from the sun, or contain ingredients, like
oxybenzone, with significant safety concerns. These products are on the
market because FDA has failed to finalize sunscreen safety standards that
have been under development since 1979, but has instead issued a series of
delays and revisions at the request of the personal care product industry.
FDA issued a new draft of the standards last October under pressure from
EWG, but continues to delay finalizing the standards at the behest of the
regulated industry.
