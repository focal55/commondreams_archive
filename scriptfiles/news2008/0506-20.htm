<p>SAN FRANCISCO - May 6 -  
 <i>A coalition of conservation groups 
represented by Earthjustice sued in federal court today to overturn the Bush 
administration's latest attempt to weaken rules governing management of 
America’s 155 
national forests and grasslands. The new rules, issued April 21, repeal key 
protections for national forests. </p>
<p>The Bush administration rule being challenged mirrors one issued in 2005 
which was thrown out by a federal court. Like the 2005 rule, the current one 
eliminates mandatory protections in place since the Reagan administration that 
require the national forests to be managed to guarantee viable wildlife 
populations, to preserve clean, healthy streams and lakes, and to protect 
diverse natural forests. The Bush rule also sharply reduces public participation 
in decisions about the management of our public forests. </p>
<p>Prior forms of the rule from 1982 and 2000 contained enforceable standards 
for forest plans that protected wildlife, water, and the forests. The earlier 
rules also provided opportunities for public involvement and required analysis 
of environmental impacts of forest plans on the national forests, impacts that 
result from plan decisions regarding logging levels and other extractive uses of 
forest resources. [I know my formula is cumbersome, but it’s also correct; 
what’s being lost with these regs is not analysis of the activities under the 
forest plans, but impacts of the forest plans themselves]. </p>
<p>Earthjustice attorney Trent Orr said, “This is the Bush administration's 
parting gift to the timber industry. These regulations remove vital checks and 
balances on logging while minimizing the role of science and the public's say in 
maintaining wildlife and other natural resources. We’ve returned to court to 
insure that the Forest Service protect these invaluable resources and allows 
full public review of and participation in its decisions about how our national 
forests will be managed."</p>
<p>The lawsuit points out 
that the Forest Service violated the National Environment Policy Act by 
approving the new regulations based on a faulty environmental impact statement 
that failed to analyze adequately the environmental impacts of the new 
regulations. Contrary to common sense, the EIS flatly asserts that the new rule, 
which governs the development of management plans for every national forest, 
will have no environmental effects on the 193 million acres of national forest 
lands. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the second 
to be filed by conservation groups challenging the new rules. </p>

<p>The conservation groups 
filing today have also sent a 60-day notice letter under the Endangered Species 
Act regarding the Forest Service's failure to adequately consult with the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service about the 
effects of the new regulations on protected species and will add those claims to 
the lawsuit after the 60 days expires. </p>
<p>“Our National Forests and 
Grasslands belong to all Americans, not industry special interests,” said Bob 
Dreher, vice president for conservation law and general counsel of Defenders of 
Wildlife. “The American public has a right to be involved in planning for the 
management of their national forests, and to have forest plans that protect the 
wildlife and other natural resources of those forests for generations to come. 
The Bush rule fails on all these counts.”</p>
<p>Earthjustice is 
representing Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, and 
Vermont Natural Resources Counsel.</p><p><a href="/programs_and_policy/habitat_conservation/federal_lands/national_forests/index.php">Learn more about what Defenders is doing to protect our forests and grasslands.</a></p>

<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Congress 
passed the National Forest Management Act in 1976 to reform the Forest Service 
and to ensure that the agency give due consideration to non-timber resources, 
such as recreation, wildlife, and water. The NFMA regulations targeted by the 
Bush administration include the critical legal requirement that national forests 
be managed to maintain viable wildlife populations. This rule supports 
populations of popular game species such as elk, moose, and black bear, and 
helps keep sensitive and rare species off the endangered species list by 
identifying and correcting wildlife population declines before species become 
imperiled. </p>
<p>The 
Reagan administration adopted this wildlife viability protection in response to 
declines in the population and range of many species caused by the routine 
approval of logging and other development projects that did not take the need to 
conserve wildlife into account. The Bush administration's attempt to repeal the 
NFMA wildlife protections threatens a future in which rare species will once 
again dwindle and disappear from the national forests. </p>
<p>The National Forest Management Act also requires the Forest Service to allow 
citizens to participate fully in forest management decisions. The Bush rules 
invalidate the 1982 standards for national forest management instituted by 
Ronald Reagan that allow public review of the environmental impacts of proposed 
national forest plans governing timber harvest levels and natural resource 
protection. </p><p>The 
court's invalidation of the Bush administration's prior attempt to change these 
rules was a strong signal that full public involvement in decisions regarding 
their public forests must be restored.</p><p align="center">###</p><p></p><p><em>Defenders of Wildlife
