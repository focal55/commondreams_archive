WASHINGTON - August 8 - More than 400 delegates to the Democratic National Convention have already signed a statement calling for “guaranteed health care for all” to be included in the national party’s 2008 platform, a spokesperson for the effort announced Friday.
<P></P>
Progressive Democrats of America launched the statement nationwide in late July. Hundreds more delegates are expected to become signers before the national convention opens in Denver on Aug. 25.
<P></P>
Donna Smith, a spokeswoman for PDA, is scheduled to attend Saturday’s national Platform Committee meeting in Pittsburgh as part of a larger coalition working for guaranteed health care for all. Smith, who is featured in the Michael Moore documentary “SiCKO,” is co-chair of the Healthcare NOT Warfare campaign.
<P></P>
The first signer of the Guaranteed Health Care for All statement, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), is also expected in Pittsburgh for the platform meeting Saturday. He is also a co-chair of the Healthcare NOT Warfare campaign.
<P></P>
In sharp contrast to the national Democratic Party’s draft platform released on Thursday, which places the insurance industry at the center of the nation’s health care future, the proposed Guaranteed Health Care for All plank makes no mention of private insurers while sketching out a health care future for the country. Instead, the proposed plank lists five key principles:
<P></P>
<li>“Guarantee accessible health care for all.”
<br>

<li>“Create a single standard of high quality, comprehensive, and preventive health care for all.”
<br>

<li>“Allow freedom of choice of physician, hospital, and other health care providers.”
<br>

<li>“Eliminate financial barriers that prevent families and individuals from obtaining the medically necessary care they need.”
<br>

<li>“Allow physicians, nurses and other licenced health care providers to make health care decisions based on what is best for the health of the patient.”
