WASHINGTON, DC - May 21 - Twenty leading environmental, conservation, health and advocacy groups issue the following statement in response to the summary of the Climate Security Act substitute amendment released by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee:
 <P></P>
"We express our appreciation to Senator Boxer for her leadership on the Climate Security Act and for working so hard and having brought this bill so far. We also applaud Senator Boxer for building support for global warming legislation among labor unions, cities and mayors, and other constituencies. We also thank the many other senators who have worked closely with Senator Boxer to improve this draft.
 <P></P>
"Effective action on global warming is urgent. The best chance for progress this year on federal global warming pollution limits is for the Senate to strengthen and pass the Climate Security Act. The bill needs to be strengthened to ensure that it will meet the reductions that science dictates are needed to prevent dangerous global warming.
 <P></P>
"We are pleased that Senator Boxer's proposal maintains the emission reduction goals over the next decade and that it increases incentives for energy efficiency."<P></P>
