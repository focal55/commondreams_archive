WASHINGTON - August 13 - Paul Helmke, President of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, issued the following statement: <br>
<br>
“All of us who desire safer airports received good news on Monday.<br>
<br>
“The decision by U.S. District Judge Marvin Shoob allows Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to put public safety first and strenuously enforce their no-gun rule in that facility.&nbsp; It was a victory for sanity and common sense.<br>

<br>
“Allowing guns into airports increases the chances of airport security being breached, something that could lead to very tragic consequences.<br>
<br>
“The gun lobby leaders in Georgia who were dealt a setback Monday should learn that public safety is more important than their agenda of pushing guns into more and more public places.”</p><p align="center"># # #</p>
<p style="font-style: oblique;" align="left"></p><p align="left">
As the nation's largest, non-partisan, grassroots organization leading the fight to prevent gun violence, the Brady Campaign, with its dedicated network of Million Mom March Chapters, works to enact and enforce sensible gun laws, regulations and public policies.  The Brady Campaign is devoted to creating an America free from gun violence,   where all Americans are safe at home, at school, at work, and in our communities.
