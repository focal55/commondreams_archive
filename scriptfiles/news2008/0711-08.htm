WASHINGTON - July 11 - At 1:30 p.m. today EST, the Bush administration will announce its further delay of greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act. Rather than regulate the dangerous gases as recommended by scientists and internal Environmental Protection Agency documents, the administration will issue an “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” that pushes the decision back into the next administration.

 
<P></P>
“The administration needs to stop passing the buck and start regulating dangerous greenhouse gases,” said Kieran Sucking, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity. “The decisions we make today will not only determine whether the polar bear and thousands of other species will be driven extinct by global warming, they will determine whether human health and the economy will be wracked by dangerous climate change.”

 
<P></P>
The Advance Notice purports to respond to the Supreme Court’s April 2, 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the Court found that greenhouse gas emissions qualify as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The court ordered the EPA to make a finding as to whether such pollution endangers public health and welfare. Such a finding would require that the gases be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Rather than actually make the finding, however, the Advance Notice solicits further comments, thereby assuring that greenhouse gas pollution will continue unabated through the current administration.

 <P></P>

Former EPA Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett transmitted a draft finding to the White House in December 2007, concluding that greenhouse gases endanger the public welfare. The administration’s suppression of that finding led to Burnett’s resignation in June.
<P></P>
 

The May 30th draft Advance Notice spotlights fatal flaws in the administration’s proposed gas-mileage standards for cars and trucks, released in early May, 2007. The gas-mileage standards were issued in response to an Appellate Court decision in Center for Biological Diversity v. NHTSA holding that the Bush administration violated the law by failing to properly consider greenhouse gas emissions when setting the standards. In the May 30th draft, the EPA concluded that gas-mileage standards well above 35 mpg are achievable in the 2020-2025 timeframe, and that the net benefits to society could exceed $2 trillion. If these conclusions survive into today’s version, they will undermine the administration’s absurd contention that fuel-economy standards can’t be set above 35 mpg, setting the stage for either an improved final rule or continued litigation.

 <P></P>

Today’s Advance Notice of Rulemaking is expected to avoid acknowledging that the ultimate criterion for determining safe greenhouse gas emission levels is whether they will result in the atmosphere containing over 350 parts of carbon dioxide per million. Scientists have determined that maintaining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in excess of 350 ppm will result in runaway global warming with catastrophic impacts to humans, wildlife, and ecosystems. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently at 385 ppm and will likely reach 550 ppm by mid century without new regulations. To reduce carbon dioxide to save levels will require reducing emission by at least 90 percent and substantially increasing carbon sequestration.
<P></P>
 

“It is essential that we reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide below 350 parts per million as rapidly as possible,” said Suckling. “Any proposal that falls short of this standard will result in catastrophic runaway global warming.”

 <P></P>

The EPA will announce the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking at a teleconference at 1:30 p.m. EST, with the following call-in number:  (866) 505-1518, use Conference ID# 55763578.<!-- #EndEditable -->
