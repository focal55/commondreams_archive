<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 22 - AP reports: "On Sunday, the [Cuban] assembly will name the president, first vice president and five other vice presidents, and 24 other members of the Council of State. Fidel, who was re-elected to the National Assembly, could remain on the council but is unlikely to receive a top position." <br>

Author of <i>People's Power: Cuba's Experience with Representative Government</i>, Roman said today: "Castro is an important leader, but there are alot of important people in Cuba. They have a system -- a flawed system -- that works, not because of Castro, but because of others who are elected at various levels, especially the municipal level." <br>

Host of a daily Spanish-language radio program, Radio Progreso, in Miami, Aruca said today: "The Cuban-American community is not a monolith. Many of us are in favor of lifting the embargo and having a dialogue and negotiations, even more so now. The three most extreme Republican Congress members on Cuba in the Miami area are under serious challenges for the first time this year." <br>
