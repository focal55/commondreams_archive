<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 5 - Five years ago, on Feb. 5, 2003, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell made the U.S. case for war before the United Nations Security Council.<br>
<br>
<br>
The following analysts are available for interviews:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a href="mailto:robrtparry@aol.com">ROBERT PARRY</a></b><br>
Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories in the 1980s for the Associated Press and <i>Newsweek</i>. His latest book, just released, is <i><a href="http://neckdeepbook.com">Neck Deep: The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush</a></i> and was written with two of his sons, Sam and Nat.<br>

<br>
Parry said: "Today marks Powell's proclamation of a series of deceptions. While many were surprised that he would allow himself to be used in such a manner, in fact, it fits a pattern of opportunism throughout his career."<br>
<br>
Parry's latest piece is "Colin Powell's Fateful Lies." On Feb. 6, 2003, he wrote "<a href="http://www.consortiumnews.com/archive/powell.html">Trust Colin Powell?</a>"<br>

<b><a href="mailto:jonathan_schwarz@sbcglobal.net">JONATHAN SCHWARZ</a></b><br>
Schwarz, a contributor to <i>Mother Jones</i> magazine, made and collected on a $1,000 bet that Iraq had no WMD. He said today: "Five years later, the evidence is overwhelming that Colin Powell knowingly -- not mistakenly -- deceived the world at the United Nations. Powell doctored transcripts, left out crucial information, and directly contradicted what he was told by his own intelligence staff."<br>

<br>
Schwarz just wrote the piece "<a href="http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/002063.html">Lie After Lie: What Colin Powell Knew Five Years Ago Today, And What He Told The World</a>."<br>
