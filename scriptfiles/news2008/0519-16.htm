SACRAMENTO, CA - May 19 - The Sacramento City Council has quickly added to its agenda
Tuesday (beginning at 2 p.m.)  the question of permitting – the city
attorney quashed the permit last week – a special Memorial Day display of
120,000 flags to commemorate the deaths of U.S. troops, and Iraqi civilians
in the war in Iraq.
<P></P>
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in Sacramento and a veterans
group will hold a MEDIA AVAILABILITY TUESDAY at 1:45 p.m. shortly before
the 2 p.m. meeting at City Hall (915 I Street).
<P></P>
The ACLU has joined veterans and other organizations in appealing the
decision by the city attorney, and is asking the City Council allow the
flags to temporarily occupy otherwise empty city land over the Memorial Day
weekend.
<P></P>
Sponsors said permit approval for the display – part of a traveling display
which has been allowed in other U.S. cities, including Portland, OR and
Boulder, CO. – was assured by the city nearly 6 weeks ago, but the city
changed its mind just a few days ago, with little notice.
<P></P>
Because of the late termination, sponsors believe the rejection is based on
the suspected political content of the display – something that may make
the rejection unconstitutional, and contrary to city ordinances. Other than
the tiny flags, sponsors said there will be no other literature or
political content.
<P></P>
Several members of the City Council, including Vietnam War veteran Ray
Treatheway, said they support the display.<!-- #EndEditable -->
