<p>WASHINGTON - January 18 - On Tuesday, Jan. 22 NOW will hold its annual vigil at the U.S. Supreme Court, commemorating the 35th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision affirming women's constitutional right to abortion.
<P></P>
"Though we are celebrating 35 years of Constitutional protection of a woman's right to abortion, we cannot let our guard down. With so many limitations and roadblocks, the promise of Roe is already denied to many women, and access to birth control is under increasing attack. This year we have the chance to elect a new administration and send new members to Congress who will help protect and expand our reproductive freedom. Come November we must elect a president who will be vigilant in upholding a woman's right to make her own childbearing decisions, including access to birth control and abortion," said NOW President Kim Gandy.
