LOS ANGELES - July 23 -A coalition of organizations has launched a new campaign urging the House Judiciary Committee to hold Karl Rove in contempt and send him to jail.  In a clear violation of the law, Rove has refused to comply with a Congressional subpoena calling on him to testify under oath about his involvement in the prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman.  Brave New Films, The Nation magazine, Campaign for America's Future, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Progress Now Action and CREDO Mobile will host a press conference in Washington DC next Tuesday, prior to delivering a petition to the House Judiciary Committee urging committee members to "let Rove know he can't decide which subpoenas he obeys and which he ignores."
<P></P>
The online petition, created by Brave New Films and housed at SendRoveToJail.com, has amassed almost 100,000 names in less than six days.  The website also includes a short YouTube video outlining Rove's involvement in the Siegelman case and making the case for holding Rove accountable.

"Karl Rove is not above the law," said Robert Greenwald, founder and president of Brave New Films.  "Rove's refusal to comply with a Congressional subpoena makes a mockery of the justice system.  Even former high government officials like Rove are accountable to the law.  Rove needs learn that we live in a democracy, not a dictatorship."
<P></P>
"Karl Rove has built a career out of bending the law, but now he seems to feel entitled simply to break it," says Michael Kieschnick, President of CREDO Mobile.  "We expect the House Judiciary Committee to agree that Karl Rove is in contempt and should be sent to jail if he persists in his flagrant disregard for the laws of this country."
<P></P>
Even as the President quietly finishes out his last days in office, Rove's audacious display of indifference in the face of an unambiguous legal directive is yet another reminder of the monarchical attitude toward the rule of law that has been such a consistent feature of the Bush administration over two terms ? an ugly characteristic most closely associated with Karl Rove's machinations.
<P></P>
The "Send Rove to Jail" campaign follows in the footsteps of Brave New Films' successful "Lieberman Must Go" campaign, which has been covered by the New York Times, AP, Wall Street Journal, The Hill, The National Journal, NPR, MSNBC, and CNN.  Prior to that, another Brave New Films video exposed Senator McCain's relationship with the controversial Reverend Rod Parsley, forcing McCain to repudiate the pastor's endorsement.
