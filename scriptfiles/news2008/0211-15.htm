<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 11 - Following the release of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction’s (SIGIR) January 2008 report, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC) today said the US military is making an important effort to dignify civilian suffering but that the numbers don’t illustrate how well they’re doing.
<p></p>
Since the Vietnam War, the US military has had the ability to make ”solatia” or “condolences” – symbolic payments to civilians suffering deaths, injuries and property damage as a result of US combat operations.  Payments made to civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan are catalogued in a quarterly SIGIR report, most recently submitted to Congress on January 30, 2008.  According to the Inspector General, over $38 million has been provided since 2004 for condolence payments—more than half for Iraqis in Anbar province, who have received $21.35 million.  More than $5.5 million has been provided in Baghdad.  In 2007, $10.8 million was budgeted—an increase of more than 30% over 2006.
 <p></p>
“Paying condolences is a tremendous opportunity to create goodwill among Iraqis,” said CIVIC’s Executive Director Sarah Holewinski. “But the accounting here is so vague as to be irrelevant in determining success or failure toward that goal.  Who was paid?  How much? Importantly, who wasn’t paid and why?”
<p></p>
In 2006, CIVIC filed a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act request) for the records used to compile SIGIR reports on condolence payments.  The Army Contracting Agency’s response included a nine-page spreadsheet outlining payment amounts ranging from $30 to $100,000, listing the general location and amount of payments made to Iraqis.  That spreadsheet did not provide details on to whom the payments were made, nor for what harm the payments corresponded.   CIVIC noted that numbers, like those in the newly released SIGIR report, provide little insight into the effective functioning of the US condolence system on the ground.
<p></p>
“Condolences aren’t just hand outs.  They’re necessary strategy in a place where the US needs the support of the population,” said Holewinski.  “Inadequate records on civilian harm–and help–deny the military the chance to prove effective implementation and ultimately the success of the condolence system.”
<p></p>
CIVIC is a Washington-based organization that believes civilians harmed in conflict should be recognized and helped by the warring parties involved.  In 2005, CIVIC's founder Marla Ruzicka was killed in Iraq by suicide bomb.  CIVIC honors her legacy and strives to sustain her vision.
