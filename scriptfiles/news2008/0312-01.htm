<p>WASHINGTON, DC - March 12 - The American Civil Liberties 
Union responded today to a stunning new report that the NSA has effectively 
revived the Orwellian "Total Information 
Awareness" domestic-spying program that was 
banned by Congress in 2003. In response, the ACLU said that it was filing a 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for more information about the spying. 
And, the group announced that it was moving its "Surveillance Clock" one minute closer to midnight. </p>
<p>"Congress shut down TIA because it represented a massive and 
unjustified governmental intrusion into the personal lives of Americans," said Caroline Fredrickson, Director of the 
Washington Legislative Office of the ACLU. "Now we find out that the security agencies are 
pushing ahead with the program anyway, despite that clear congressional 
prohibition. The program described by current and former intelligence officials 
in&nbsp;Monday's Wall Street Journal 
could be modeled on Orwell’s Big 
Brother." </p>

<p>The ACLU said the new report confirmed its past warnings that the NSA was 
engaging in extremely broad-based data mining that was violating the privacy of 
vast numbers of Americans.</p>
<p>The Total Information Awareness (TIA) program was a mammoth data mining 
program that envisioned programming computers to trawl through an extensive list 
of databases containing personal information about Americans – including communications, medical, travel, 
education and financial data – in an attempt 
to detect supposedly "suspicious" patterns. Congress shut down the program amid 
bipartisan objections that it was the most far-reaching domestic surveillance 
proposal that had ever been offered.</p>
<p>"Year after year, we have warned that our great nation is turning into 
a surveillance society where our every move is tracked and monitored," said Barry Steinhardt, Director of the ACLU’s Technology and Liberty Project. "Now we have before us a program that appears to 
do that very thing. It brings together numerous programs that we and many others 
have fought for years, and it confirms what the ACLU has been saying the NSA is 
up to: mass surveillance of Americans." </p>
<p>Last year, the ACLU created its Surveillance Clock (<a href="http://www.aclu.org/clock" target="_new" class="noline_blue">www.aclu.org/clock</a>) as a way to symbolize the 
nation’s rapid descent toward a surveillance 
society. Initially set to six minutes before midnight, the ACLU today moved it 
up to five minutes before midnight to highlight the greater threat to privacy 
Americans face in light of the NSA’s 
activities. </p>
<p>According to the new Journal report, the NSA was engaging in broad 
domestic spying operations that involve collecting and analyzing the personal 
information of Americans in ways that are "essentially the same" as TIA. The elements that reportedly make up the 
new spying encompass a variety of mass surveillance and data mining programs 
about which the ACLU has previously warned, including: </p>


<p>TIA and other data mining programs.</p><ul><li>The NSA’s illegal wiretapping program, 
the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP).</li></ul>

<ul><li>The Patriot Act’s broadening of FBI power 
to collect third-party personal information without a subpoena through Section 
215 searches and National Security Letters.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Treasury Department’s expanded 
surveillance of financial transactions through Cash Transaction Reporting and 
Suspicious Activity Reporting.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The CIA’s illegitimate access to the 
SWIFT database to monitor international financial transactions.</li></ul>
<ul><li>DHS’s efforts to increase collection and 
monitoring of airline passenger data.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Partnerships between these government agencies and private sector entities to 
collect and monitor customers’ data and 
transactions.</li></ul>
<p>The erosion of privacy through the judicial creation of a distinction between 
content and "transactional data" (such as the recipients of e-mails or phone 
calls and the times and dates of each communication) through the Patriot Act and 
prior developments. </p>
<p>"Congress needs to investigate immediately whether its will has been 
thwarted, and the media needs to give this program the attention it deserves as 
a radical departure from the privacy that Americans have always expected," said Fredrickson. "Just how many times is Congress going to sit back 
and watch this administration run roughshod over its prerogatives?"</p>
<p>The FOIA request the ACLU filed today is intended to gain information about 
the "role that the NSA plays as a hub for 
the collection, analysis and distribution" 
of "transactional information of 
Americans." It seeks information from the 
NSA as well as the FBI, CIA, the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence, and the Departments of Treasury, Justice, Defense, and Homeland 
Security. </p>
<p>In 2006, the ACLU published a summary of what it believed the NSA was doing, 
based on the various media reports citing current and former intelligence 
officials. In the piece, entitled "Eavesdropping 101," the ACLU warned that the NSA was not just 
carrying out warrantless wiretaps on selected individuals, but probably carrying 
out broader data dragnets that violated the privacy of millions of Americans. 
This prospect has not always remained in focus during the debates over the 
agency’s illegal spying. </p>

<p>"We now know that TIA lives," said 
Steinhardt. "The question is, does American 
privacy live? And does Congress’ will to 
defend it? This program will be a test case; may we prove worthy of the freedom 
we have inherited."</p>
