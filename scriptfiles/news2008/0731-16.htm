NEW YORK - July 31 - The American Civil Liberties Union obtained a government "manual" 
distributed to defense lawyers assigned to represent immigrant workers arrested 
and prosecuted in last May's Postville, Iowa meatpacking raids. The document – 
posted on the ACLU Web site today – contains prepackaged scripts for plea and 
sentencing hearings as well as documents providing for guilty pleas and waivers 
of rights that were used to push the more than 300 Postville workers through 
mass criminal proceedings as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>"This document provides further evidence of the government's disturbing 
pressure cooker tactics for mass guilty pleas that assumed guilt instead of 
protecting the constitutional presumption of innocence," said ACLU Immigrants' 
Rights Project Director Lucas Guttentag. "Along with the workers, fairness and 
due process were the victims of the Postville prosecutions." </p>

<p>The government "manual" provided for the workers to waive all their legal 
rights and in the overwhelming majority of cases, to plead guilty to charges of 
falsely using identity documents for employment. It was an important tool used 
to rush defendants through the criminal justice and immigration systems without 
a criminal trial or immigration proceedings. The plea forms in the "manual" 
included a requirement barring immigrants from pursuing any legal claims or 
procedures under the immigration laws. </p>
<p>After the Postville meatpacking raids, the ACLU and many other organizations 
sharply condemned the denial of basic legal protections to the arrested 
immigrant workers. The troubling system implemented by the U.S. Attorney's 
Office and the Department of Homeland Security appeared designed to undermine 
fairness and due process by criminally prosecuting the workers under 
circumstances that undermined their ability to understand or protect their 
rights.</p>
<p>The large scale criminal prosecution of workers is a new tactic of the Bush 
administration. Previously, charges of fraud and identity theft were usually 
reserved for cases that involved the theft of people's identities to rob them of 
money and property and did not typically extend to the use of false papers for 
employment. </p>
