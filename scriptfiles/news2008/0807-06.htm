WASHINGTON - August 7 - The League of Women Voters today called for a moratorium on new construction of coal-fired electric power plants.
<P></P>
“Global warming is happening now,” said national League President Mary G. Wilson. “If we wait for federal action from our congressional leaders, it will be too late.  We must take immediate and aggressive action to halt climate change,” she said.  (Click <a href="http://www.lwv.org/Content/ContentGroups/StudyTaskforces/GlobalClimateChange/Coal_FactSheet_2008.pdf" target="_new">here</a> for a fact sheet on the League’s stand.)
<P></P>
“Burning more coal is too big a risk for too many people,” Wilson said.  “Coal is the single largest source of global warming pollution in the U.S., with power plants responsible for 33 percent of CO2 emissions.  Because of this pollution, we already face increasingly severe heat waves and droughts, intensifying hurricanes and floods, disappearing glaciers and more wildfires.  If left unchecked, the effects will be catastrophic to us and our planet,” she said.
<P></P>
“We will be active in opposing the building of these plants,” said Wilson.  “Coal-fired electric power plants have a very long lifespan and contribute huge amounts of pollution to the atmosphere.  Building these new plants would foreclose the possibility of preventing dangerous global warming.” 
<P></P>
“Today, there is no environmentally sound use of coal,” Wilson said.  “Many hope that CO2 can be captured and stored underground,” she observed, “but this technology has never been demonstrated on a commercial scale.” 
<P></P>
“Instead of coal, we must look to clean energy alternatives,” according to Wilson.  “California, which has been a leader in energy conservation and efficiency, has been able to keep per capita energy consumption essentially constant for three decades while enjoying a growing economy,” she noted.  “Wind and solar are also ready to make large contributions to economic growth,” she said.     
<P></P>
The League carefully examined many facets of energy policy before taking its stand (click <a href="http://www.lwv.org/Content/ContentGroups/StudyTaskforces/GlobalClimateChange/CoalFAQ_FINAL.pdf" target="_new">here</a> for the League’s FAQ).  “We support strong action in Congress to stop global climate change, but the planet can’t wait,” Wilson concluded.
