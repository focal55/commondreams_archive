WASHINGTON, DC - May 13 - President Bush has submitted a new war funding request totaling $178 billion. $135.4 billion of this war supplemental would go toward operations in Iraq through the end of the year. The remainder of the $42.6 billion would go to operations in Afghanistan and other activities in the global war against terrorist networks.</p>

Based on updated information released, a new interactive map below shows a breakdown by state of what taxpayers could now be facing should the full amount of funding be approved.</p>
