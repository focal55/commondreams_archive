<p>BOSTON, MA - April 14 - LEADING TO WAR is a new
documentary film that reveals the Bush administration's 14-month campaign
to persuade the public to support an invasion of Iraq. Constructed from
carefully selected television news footage of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice
and other officials, the film is available for free viewing on the
internet, subtitled in an unprecedented 19 languages. The film, along with
the extensively researched website <a href="http://www.leadingtowar.com/" target="_new">http://www.LeadingtoWar.com</a>, provides a potent
new resource that examines Bush's path to war.

    LEADING TO WAR, praised by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as "a
staggering film," highlights how Bush officials presented claims of
imminent danger to rush the United States to war. This calculated strategy
included warnings of nuclear peril and terrorists with biological weapons.
Without narration or commentary, the film documents the rhetoric that
roused the American people to support a military invasion, despite
worldwide opposition. The film includes footage from press conferences,
interviews and speeches.

<P></P>

    Award-winning director Barry Hershey began the project in 2005. He
realized that the extraordinary events that led to war could best be shown
by presenting Bush officials in their own words. Reflecting new trends in
media, the film is available for free download or streaming at
    <a href="http://www.leadingtowar.com/" target="_new">http://www.LeadingtoWar.com</a> and is subtitled in 19 languages: Arabic, Bahasa,
English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin
(Traditional/Simplified), Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish (Latin
American/Castilian), Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese.

    "For those not subjected to Bush's media campaign -- people in other
countries, and future generations - this footage will be especially
revealing," said Hershey. "With the perspective of history, and the
compression of 14 months into a concise 72 minutes, the film provides a
unique opportunity to see how a government sells a war to its people."

<P></P>

    LEADING TO WAR's release coincides with the war in Iraq entering its
6th year -- with violence continuing, hundreds of thousands maimed or
killed, and 4 million Iraqis having fled their homes. The film and website,
    <a href="http://www.leadingtowar.com/" target="_new">http://www.LeadingToWar.com</a>, are supported on a worldwide network of 20,000
servers to provide enhanced quality for international viewers.
