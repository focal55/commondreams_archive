WASHINGTON - June 26 - The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation today commended the steps taken by the Bush Administration and North Korea to disable and verify the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. 
<p></p>
Leonor Tomero, Director of Nuclear Non-Proliferation at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said <b>“Today’s steps are welcome progress and represent a notable milestone.” </b>
<p></p>
Tomero continued: <b>“The declaration by North Korea of its nuclear program, the destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon, and granting access to its personnel and nuclear sites vindicate the Bush Administration’s policy of engaging in negotiations with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program.” </b>
<p></p>
She added <b>“It is also encouraging that the negotiating process is on track, and that both sides seem to be serious about implementing their sides of the agreement in good faith.”</b> 
<p></p>
<b>“Several important and difficult steps remain, including verifying North Korea’s declaration, dealing with remaining North Korean nuclear weapons, and putting in place a reliable verification system to ensure North Korea does not pursue a covert nuclear program, but so far, so good,” </b>Tomero concluded.
<p></p>
Immediate next steps in the process include the United States verifying North Korea’s declaration of its nuclear program, and beginning a 45-day review process to remove North Korea from the list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
<p></p>North Korea is planning to destroy the cooling tower at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor site tomorrow in front of dozens of foreign television cameras.
