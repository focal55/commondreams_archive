<p>WASHINGTON, DC - February 6 -  Conservative pundits have a new talking
point courtesy of the <em>National Journal</em>'s new claim that Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) is
the Senate's "most liberal" member. But there's more to
the story than the talking heads would have the American people think.</p>

<p>In an email, the National Journal Group encouraged
subscribers to read the magazine's Senate ratings, stating: "We expect
this story will have immediate traction in the media and blogosphere and at
watercoolers around the country. In 2004, President Bush invoked Senator John
Kerry's [D-MA] liberal Vote Ratings score repeatedly on the campaign trail and
at their head-to-head debates." </p>

<p>The email did not mention that the <em><em>National Journal</em></em> has acknowledged the
methodology it used to produce its "most liberal" rating for Kerry
was flawed. </p>

<p><strong>"It seems the <em>National Journal</em> is more interested in
becoming part of a campaign's talking points than honestly and accurately
assessing the votes of United
  States senators," </strong>said
Karl Frisch, a <em>Media Matters for America</em>
spokesman.<strong> "Failing to disclose
previous flaws in its rating system is irresponsible. The <em>National Journal</em> should focus on reporting
the facts, instead of spinning for attention."</strong></p>

<p>Numerous outlets and conservative media figures have
reported on the <em><em>National Journal</em></em>'s
rating of Obama as "the most liberal senator in 2007," but have
ignored issues raised about the 2003 study and the fact that the same <em><em>National Journal </em></em>feature could not rate
Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) because he "missed more than half of the votes in
both the economic and foreign-policy categories." </p>

<p>The <em>National
Journal</em> has yet to reveal how most
other senators compared to Sens. Obama, McCain, and Hillary Rodham
Clinton (D-NY) in their 2007 ratings -- a problem for those looking to dig
deeper into the report's findings.</p>

<p>In an email
to readers encouraging recipients to read the <em><em>National Journal</em></em> article on the
magazine's Senate ratings, the National Journal Group wrote: "We expect
this story will have immediate traction in the media and blogosphere and at
watercoolers around the country. In 2004, President Bush invoked Senator John
Kerry's liberal Vote Ratings score repeatedly on the campaign trail and at

flawed. </p>

<p><em><em>Media
Matters </em></em>has identified numerous media outlets or figures
who reported that the <em><em>National Journal</em></em>

has rated Sen. Barack Obama "the most liberal senator in 2007," but
did not report that the same <em><em>National
Journal </em></em>feature stated that Sen. John McCain "did not vote
frequently enough in 2007 to draw a composite score. He missed more than half
of the votes in both the economic and foreign-policy categories."</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
