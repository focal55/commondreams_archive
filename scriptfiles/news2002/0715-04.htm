- July 15 - The Sierra Club today expressed deep concern that the Bush Administration's 
approach to the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg 
may seriously undermine the global community's efforts to protect clean air and 
water, and fight global warming. The Sierra Club is stressing to the Administration 
that working with other countries at the Johannesburg Summit to hold enormous 
global corporations accountable for their environmental impact will help protect 
the environment both here at home and around the world.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Administration 
has consistently blocked attempts to protect the global environment by promoting 
plans that benefit large corporations rather than the billions of citizens who 
have to deal with environmental crises, like dirty water and air, and global climate 
change,&quot; said Sierra Club Director Michael Dorsey, who has represented the 
Club during the preparatory meetings and will attend the Johannesburg Summit. 
&quot;People around the world are seriously concerned that the Bush administration 
is undermining the World Summit instead of working with other countries to benefit 
everyone.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1992, heads of state, including President George H. W. Bush, attended the 
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They were asked to support binding international 
treaties on forest protection, climate change and biodiversity protection. President 
Bush Sr. agreed to the Rio Declaration and its Principles on Sustainable Development 
&quot;with the goal of establishing a new and equitable global partnership through 
the creation of new levels of cooperation among States.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A decade later, George W. Bush is attempting to reverse his father's legacy 
and turn back the clock. Instead of a partnership among nations, he proposes to 
eliminate oversight of corporations on the 10-year anniversary of the Earth Summit 
slated to begin in August in South Africa. The President is ignoring in this approach, 
the very lesson he has just affirmed with regard to domestic corporations for 
&quot;standards enforced by strict laws and upheld by responsible business leaders.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the final preparatory meeting held in May in Bali, the US government delegation, 
following the directive of the Bush Administration, repeatedly resisted any serious 
steps to address a host of global environmental problems, especially global warming. 
The Administration steadfastly opposes international efforts to hold multinational 
corporations accountable for their business practices. The head of the US delegation 
criticized environmental targets and timetables as &quot;theater&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot; 
not worthy of serious consideration. Already more than 200 non-governmental organizations 
have signed a critique of the Johannesburg meeting entitled, &quot;A Disaster 
in the Making&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What is fiction is not the concept of the global community holding global 
corporations accountable,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope, 
&quot;but the idea that voluntary actions by these corporations will protect the 
world's citizens from pollution, destruction of their communities and the natural 
resources upon which they depend.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Unfortunately, this appears to be another attempt by President Bush to 
withdraw from global cooperation,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Director of the Sierra 
Club's International Program, who will also be attending the summit for the Sierra 
Club. &quot;Americans want to be part of a country that acts as a responsible 
neighbor, and they know we need to cooperate with other nations to protect the 
environment if we expect them to cooperate with us.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club will be asking the Administration to promote efforts to shift 
policy away from an approach that benefits corporations but rarely protects the 
environment. At the summit, the Sierra Club will be advocating for the Administration 
to:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Represent public interests 
before corporate interests by supporting binding corporate accountability measures, 
including public release of corporate environmental performance data. The Administration 
supports voluntary, non-binding environmental agreements that rely on corporations 
policing themselves.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reverse its position that 
World Trade Organization rules should trump international environmental agreements.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Seriously address climate 
change and air pollution: So far the Administration has shown a lack of commitment 
to curbing climate change and protecting clean air, as evidenced by withdrawal 
from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, and domestic efforts to weaken the 
Clean Air Act.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Respect the basic human 
right to clean drinking water - not undermine it by privatizing water services. 
In March, during its testimony on the Water Investment Act of 2002 the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency stated that the Administration did not support additional funding 
to help the country's crumbling water systems, but instead believed that privatization 
is a better solution. The Administration is expected to support a similar position 
in Johannesburg. As we have just seen with Enron and Global Crossing, unregulated 
private companies cannot be relied upon to provide basic public services at a 
fair and just cost. We should not add drinking water as yet another vital public 
service that will be open to corporate manipulation and profiteering.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protect Agriculture and Biodiversity. The Administration must resist pressure 
from huge agri-businesses and instead support calls for biosafety in order to 
prevent the widespread production and use of genetically modified organisms in 
agriculture.
