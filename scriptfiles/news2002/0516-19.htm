- May 16 - Michael D. Barnes, 

President of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, today issued 

the following statement regarding reports that lawyers for John 

Walker Lindh, the California man accused of fighting with the 

Taliban, are seeking to dismiss a firearms charge against him based 

on the Bush Administration's reversal of the United State's 

long-standing position on the Second Amendment: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It was only a matter of time before the Bush Administration's 

new position on the Second Amendment would be used in an attempt to 

prevent terrorists and criminals from being prosecuted on firearms 

charges, but this is incredible,&quot; said Barnes. &quot;It is extremely 

disturbing that one of the first cases to use Ashcroft's new 

position would be an individual who was fighting for the fanatics 

who took so many innocent lives on September 11, 2001. What an 

ironic development in the war on terrorism.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is just the tip of the iceberg. The National Rifle 

Association (NRA) has already stated that it would use a changed 

U.S. position to challenge the constitutionality of common-sense 

gun laws. Look at how hard the NRA has tried to defend the ability 

of Timothy Joe Emerson to own guns, a man who had threatened his 

wife and child with a pistol, owned an arsenal of weapons, and had 

a domestic violence restraining order against him. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sadly, thanks to Mr. Ashcroft and the Bush Administration, we 

can expect to see more challenges to life-saving gun laws and more 

attempts by criminals to overturn firearms convictions.&quot; </font></p>
