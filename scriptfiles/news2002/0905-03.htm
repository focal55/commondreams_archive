YORK - September 5 - Colombian President Alvaro Uribe should immediately reverse 

Colombia's decision not to accept, for a period of seven years, the jurisdiction 

of the International Criminal Court (ICC) over war crimes, Human Rights Watch 

said today. The Colombian government only recently admitted having made this decision, 

which was contained in a declaration filed with the United Nations on August 5.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the treaty provision invoked by Colombia, a state party can decline the 

ICC's competence for up to seven years for war crimes committed by one of its 

nationals or on its territory. Such crimes are committed routinely by both rebel 

and paramilitary forces in Colombia.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the government has not stated its reasons for rejecting the court's 

jurisdiction during this period, the move appears intended to bolster the government's 

bargaining power in eventual peace negotiations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This step looks like a prelude to impunity, via some kind of amnesty 

law,&quot; said Jos&eacute; Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights 

Watch's Americas Division. &quot;At the moment, peace has never seemed further 

off, and this dispensation will only encourage more horrific abuses against civilians 

to occur. President Uribe can reverse the declaration at any time, and he should 

do so now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Colombia ratified the ICC's treaty on August 5. Unbeknown to the general public, 

it introduced a declaration under Article 124 of the statute, a transitional provision 

that allows state parties to reject the court's jurisdiction for a seven-year 

period for crimes covered under Article 8 of the statute. Article 8, which covers 

war crimes, includes crimes like intentional attacks on the civilian population, 

hostage-taking, summary executions, torture and the recruitment of children under 

15.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Article 124 declaration was not made public at the time of Colombia's ratification, 

nor was it discussed in the Colombian Congress. According to a foreign ministry 

statement on September 2, &quot;Congress was aware of this possibility and presented 

no objection at the time.&quot; But Colombia's ambassador to the United Nations, 

Alfonso Valdivieso, admitted Congress &quot;probably didn't know&quot; about the 

government's plans.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The government of President Andr&eacute;s Pastrana made the declaration two 

days before President Uribe took office, reportedly in consultation with the new 

president. Another declaration the government attached to the ICC ratification 

stated that the government believed itself free to decree amnesties or pardons 

for political crimes.</font></p>
