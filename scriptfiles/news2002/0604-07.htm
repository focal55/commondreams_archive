<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 4 - The Sierra Club reacted to the Census Bureau's release that the national average of time spent commuting increased by pointing to the common-sense, responsible transportation and development solutions that will let Americans enjoy shorter commutes, cleaner air, and more time with their families.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Information released by the Census Bureau today shows that commuting times are increasing across the country as more people are spending more time alone in their car.  Average commute times to work in the U.S. increased an average of 3.1 minutes, from 22.4 to 25.5 minutes, from 1990-2000 according to Census numbers.  At the same time, the number of people driving alone increased 2.5 percent  (73.2 percent  to 75.7 percent), while carpooling, transit use, walking and other forms of transportation all dropped slightly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What's troubling about this increase in commute time is that it's largely due to poor planning that takes choices away from people,&quot; said Melody Flowers, Associate Washington Representative of Sierra Club's Challenge to Sprawl Campaign.  &quot;Scattered development and haphazard road-building are leaving commuters stuck in their cars, instead of spending time with their families or at work.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A National Association of Realtors poll done in September of 2001 showed that 62 percent of commuters surveyed would be willing to take rail transit if it was convenient, accessible and safe.  And more than half of commuters would take the bus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club believes the main cause for increased commuter time is

sprawl: scattered development that increases traffic, saps local resources and destroys open space. By better balancing transportation spending between roads and less-polluting public transportation, like rail transit and clean buses, we can reduce the number of miles people have to drive, provide Americans with more transportation choices, and better reflect America's priorities for a clean environment, good health, and enhanced quality of life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to save time and protect our communities and clean our air and water, the Sierra Club recommends transportation policies that:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*    Make significantly greater investments in clean, public

transportation.<br>

*    Build more affordable housing near transit and job centers.<br>

*    Improve neighborhood walking and bicycling conditions and access to

shopping and   parks, and implement traffic calming measures.<br>

*    Use resources to maintain existing roads before building new ones and

spend less     tax dollars on new car-only projects<br>

*    Promote and support regional and statewide planning that combines

transportation,     land use and environmental planning.<br>

*    Support public involvement in the transportation and land use planning

process.<br>

*    Fund innovative incentive-based programs for encouraging alternative

transportation      use, such as tax credits for public transit, walking or

biking, parking cash-out      and parking fees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By focusing on giving people more choices for how they get around, and looking at new developments in a more responsible way, families will be able to enjoy shorter commutes, cleaner air, and more time with each other,&quot; continued Flowers.</font></p>
