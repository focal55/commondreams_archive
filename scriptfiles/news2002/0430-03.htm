- April 30 -  In an historic decision, the <a href="http://www.ci.cambridge.ma.us/dept/council.html" target="_new">Cambridge City Council</a> 

voted unanimously not to invest in World Bank Bonds until the Bank 

changes its destructive policies.  With this resolution, Cambridge 

becomes the seventh city in the US to join the boycott, and the first 

in the Northeast.  The resolution also called on the State 

Legislature and the Governor to join the boycott on a state level, 

further underscoring the condemnation of World Bank practices which 

have created deep poverty for millions and caused serious 

environmental damage with irresponsible development projects.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The World Bank receives 80% of its funding from the sale of bonds,&quot; 

said Catherine Benedict of Bankbusters, a local volunteer group 

spearheading the Cambridge campaign.  &quot;By refusing to invest in the 

World Bank, Cambridge and other cities and organizations are having a 

real material impact on the Bank.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of Cambridge residents testified in favor of the resolution, 

some representing such organizations as Cambridge's Area 4 

Neighborhood Coalition, Carpenters Local 40, Centro Presente, and the 

National Lawyers Guild.  Speakers discussed the World Bank's impact 

on workers who lose jobs, on immigrants forced to flee poverty in 

their homelands, on the environment, and more.  Over 20 organizations 

in the city had endorsed the campaign, along with roughly 900 

individuals who signed petitions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution specifically called on the bank to respect labor 

rights, stop promoting privatization, cancel 100% of debts owed to it 

by impoverished nations, and stop the imposition of destructive 

economic policies.  It also instructed the City Manager to 

investigate and report on further steps the City could take to oppose 

the destructive policies of the World Bank.</font></p>
