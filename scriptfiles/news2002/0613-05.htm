- June 13 - The nonprofit Clean Air Trust today assailed the Bush Administration's 
new plan to weaken the Clean Air Act. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The plan announced today by the Environmental Protection Agency will 
undermine the Clean Air Act by creating gaping new loopholes that will allow big 
polluters to increase pollution,&quot; said Frank O'Donnell, executive director 
of the Clean Air Trust. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell added &quot;this plan appears to pose a direct threat to the enforcement 
actions that EPA has brought against electric power companies, refineries and 
other smokestack industries.&quot; He noted those industries &quot;illegally modified 
their plants without installing new cleanup controls.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell noted that EPA was responding to heavy lobbying by industry groups 
led by such powerful lobbyists as Haley Barbour, former Republican National Committee 
Chairman and current RNC Chairman Mark Racicot. They have lobbied the Bush Administration 
and Congress on behalf of defendants -- including Southern Company. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Lawsuits were brought against these companies for violating the so-called 
new source review provisions of the law,&quot; O'Donnell noted. &quot;Their defense 
was that they were only doing routine maintenance. But now the Bush Administration 
seeks to change the definition of routine maintenance,&quot; O'Donnell noted. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This looks like nothing more than an engraved invitation to powerful 
campaign contributors,&quot; O'Donnell added. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is remarkable that the announcement, not expected for several months, 
has been rushed out on the eve of a massive Republican fundraiser scheduled for 
next Wednesday.&quot; </font></p>
