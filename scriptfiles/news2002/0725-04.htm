- July 25 - The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) -- a purported "good 

government" group that pushes special-interest legislation from big corporations 

-- will entertain state lawmakers from around the country next month at the home 

of Disney World. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite state budget crunches, many lawmakers are attending the

annual ALEC conference Aug. 6-11 at taxpayer expense, according to

Defenders of Wildlife. They will be joined at a posh Orlando, Fla.,

resort by platoons of lobbyists, corporate executives, and

representatives of trade and professional associations who give

tens of thousands of dollars each to ALEC for access to the

lawmakers.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"As the nation focuses on the ethics of corporate America,

ALEC's corporate underwriters will wine and dine lawmakers in

Orlando in an attempt to influence state policies on a wide range

of key issues. Protecting corporate polluters from environmental

regulation is a major ALEC goal," a Defenders of Wildlife

spokesperson said.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to a report by Defenders of Wildlife and the Natural

Resources Defense Council, ALEC is almost entirely funded -- not by

dues from legislator members -- but by corporations, trade and

professional associations, and ultraconservative foundations. In

return, ALEC, which touts itself as a membership association, acts

as a conduit for special-interest legislation to key state

lawmakers, according to the report.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Influence peddling to shape government laws to suit corporate

special interests is not just a Washington phenomenon," Defenders

of Wildlife President Rodger Schlickeisen said. "It is just as

aggressive if not as visible in the states. Especially now as the

nation demands greater corporate responsibility, it's time

to shine the public spotlight on how ALEC allows major corporations

to exercise corrosive, secretive and highly influential power on

state policymaking."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALEC's major underwriters have included the now-disgraced Enron

Corporation, as well as the American Nuclear Energy Council, the

American Petroleum Institute, Amoco, Chevron, Coors Brewing

Company, Shell, Texaco, Chlorine Chemistry Council, Union Pacific

Railroad, Pharmaceutical Research &amp; Manufacturers of America, Waste

Management, Philip Morris Management Corporation, R.J. Reynolds

Tobacco and many other of the nation's major corporations and trade

associations, according to the report.

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALEC's own Web site, <a href="http://www.alec.org" target="_new">http://www.alec.org</a>., 

promises "daily special events and giveaways" from corporate exhibitors in Orlando. 

The agenda features nightly parties, dancing, a golf tournament and even a "cigar 

reception" -- and all only minutes away from Disney theme parks, ALEC boasts. 

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"From the magic of Walt Disney World to the thrills of Universal

Studios to the excitement of Sea World, there's something for

everyone in Orlando," the ALEC Web site says.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report by Defenders of Wildlife and the NRDC titled "Corporate America's 

Trojan Horse in the States: The Untold Story Behind the American Legislative Exchange 

Council" -- is available online at <a href="http://www.alecwatch.org" target="_new">http://www.alecwatch.org</a>. </font></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has been endorsed by 

public-interest organizations that include the Center for Policy Alternatives, 

U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the League of Conservation Voters, and Public 

Citizen. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"ALEC allows its corporate underwriters to do what they couldn't

attempt to do directly or openly without risking public criticism,"

the report states. "They funnel cash through ALEC to curry favor

with state lawmakers through junkets and other largesse in the

hopes of enacting special-interest legislation -- all while

keeping safely outside the public eye."

more information on state lawmakers who are associated with ALEC.
