- May 6 - The Brecht Forum, home of the Institute for Popular Education and the New York Marxist School, will host a reception in honor of Political Research Associates' (PRA) 20-year history of providing information and resources to activists.  The reception will be held at 122 West 27th St., 10th Floor, in New York City on Thursday, May 23rd beginning at 7:30pm.  

<p>The Brecht Forum is one of New York's oldest political education centers, providing classes, seminars and workshops for progressive activists throughout the year. "The staff of PRA consistently turns out reliable information and analysis that activists can use to challenge social and economic injustice," said Nan Rubin, co-chair of the Brecht Forum's Board of Directors. She continued, "We are delighted to host this event and help PRA celebrate their 20 years of tracking the twists and turns of the U.S. body politic as it dances to the tune of right-wing movements.  PRA is a unique organization that deserves the strongest support and appreciation from the left!"

<p>The evening will feature brief remarks and an opportunity for supporters to meet with PRA staff.  ""We're delighted that the Brecht Forum is providing us with this opportunity to connect with old friends and meet new ones," commented PRA Director Kate Cloud.

<p>This will be the second major event in New York for the Somerville, MA based organization.  They will host another celebration on Wednesday, May 22nd at the RamScale Loft, located at 463 West St., from 6pm - 8:30pm.
