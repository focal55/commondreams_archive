- August 26 - CEOs of companies under investigation for accounting irregularities 

earned 70% more from 1999 to 2001 than the average CEO at large companies, according 

to a new report, &quot;Executive Excess 2002: CEOs Cook the Books, Skewer the 

Rest of Us.&quot;</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CEOs of 23 large companies under 

investigation earned an average of $62 million from 1999 to 2001, compared with 

an average of $36 million for all CEOs in the annual Business Week executive pay 

survey.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report looked at companies which 

are under investigation by the SEC, Department of Justice, and other agencies 

and which have had market capitalizations over $1 billion sometime since January 

2001 and: Adelphia, AOL Time Warner, Bristol Myers Squibb, CMS Energy, Duke Energy, 

Dynegy, El Paso, Enron, Global Crossing, Halliburton, Hanover Compressor, Homestore, 

Kmart, Lucent Technologies, Mirant, Network Associates, Peregrine Systems, PNC 

Financial Services, Reliant Energy, Qwest, Tyco, WorldCom, and Xerox.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Collectively, the CEOs at firms under 

investigation pocketed $1.4 billion from 1999 to 2001. While these executives 

are cushioned by the vast wealth they have accumulated, their shareholders and 

employees are dealing with massive losses. Between January 1, 2000, and July 21, 

2002, the value of shares at these firms plunged by $530 billion, about 73 percent 

of their total value.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Employees of the 23 companies have 

suffered a total of 162,000 layoffs since January 2001. Tyco, for example, has 

laid off 18,400 workers in that time. The company paid CEO Dennis Kozlowski $331 

million from 1999 to 2001 and gave him over $135 million for luxury living. Kozlowski 

has since resigned in disgrace.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Taxpayers shoulder the burden when 

corporations show different books to shareholders and the government. A recent 

IRS study shows that hocus-pocus accounting techniques allowed companies to report 

profits to shareholders that were 24% higher than the profits reported to the 

IRS. Profits reported to shareholders rose from $753 billion in 1996 to $817 billion 

in 1998, while corporate profits reported to the government declined over the 

same period from $660 billion to $658 billion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stock option accounting explains 

a major portion of this discrepancy, especially in the high tech sector. Merrill 

Lynch estimated that if stock options were treated as expenses, earnings for the 

S&amp;P 500 would have been 21% lower in 2001 and an estimated 10% lower in 2002.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Congress reconvenes after Labor 

Day, legislation to require the same option accounting for shareholders and the 

government will be debated.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High-tech companies lobbying to preserve 

the status quo on stock options have a great deal to lose. TechNet, a high-powered 

group of high tech executives, is leading the lobbying effort. If the companies 

run by TechNet Executive Board members had been forced to expense options in 2001, 

their reported earnings per share would have declined between 14 percent and 100 

percent. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CEO pay remains stubbornly high, 

despite a slight drop in CEO pay from 2000 to 2001. The CEO-worker pay gap of 

411-to-1 is nearly ten times as high as the 1982 ratio of 42-to-1.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Worker pay is again stagnating: the 

Commerce Department reports lower wages and salaries in August 2002 than in December 

2000. If worker pay had grown as fast as CEO pay since 1990, production workers 

would have averaged $101,156 in 2001 instead of $25,467. If the minimum wage had 

grown as fast as CEO pay, it would have been $21.41 an hour in 2001 instead of 

$5.15.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The explosion of corporate scandals 

has helped stoke a growing backlash against excessive executive compensation. 

The report offers a 9-course menu of remedies, including expensing options, ending 

taxpayer subsidies for excessive pay, banning special perks to executives, and 

improving transparency and corporate accountability.</font></p>
