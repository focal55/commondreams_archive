Highly Restrictive Legislation Targeting Non-Governmental Organizations

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - June 5 - Legislation that allows the Egyptian government to summarily dissolve any non-governmental organization, confiscate its assets and jail its leaders, passed the Egyptian Parliament Monday. Once President Hosni Mubarak signs it, it will become law.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a giant step backwards for Egypt,&quot; said Neil Hicks, the director of LCHR's Special Initiative on Human Rights in the Middle East. &quot;The extremely limited political space that Egyptian civil groups have to operate in today is on the verge of disappearing altogether.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new legislation, which is designed to regulate the work of private aid and advocacy groups in Egypt, was drawn up to replace Law 153 of 1999. Law 153 was struck down by Egypt's High Constitutional Court in June 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rather than endorse the new law, we urge President Mubarak to send it back to Parliament with instructions to work with non-governmental groups to develop a new law on associations that will promote civil society's freedoms rather than further hamper them,&quot; added Hicks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major problems with the new draft law lie in three areas:</font></p>

<ol>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They entrench a policy of state domination over the non-governmental sector. The most egregious element in the new draft law is the power vested in the Ministry of Social Affairs, an administrative authority, to dissolve an association and seize its assets by administrative order, without first having to obtain a court ruling to permit such drastic action. In this important respect, the proposed new law is even worse than Law 153 of 1999. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of overly broad language. Proposed language in the bill could be used to prosecute NGOs that engage in a wide range of activities. Under the bill's language virtually any criticism of a government activity or government official could be construed as &quot;political&quot; and be deemed illegal. </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Severe criminal penalties for activists. Leaders, members and employees of NGOs not registered under the new law could face fines of 2,000 to 10,000 Egyptian Pounds (approximately $400 to $2,000), and imprisonment for between six months and one year. This includes most of Egypt's human rights groups. </font></li>

</ol>
