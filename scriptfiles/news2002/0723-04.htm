<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WASHINGTON - July 23 - News 

Advisory: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What: <br>

The Working Group on Corporate Accountability, a coalition of some 120 NGOs, labor, 

environmental and civic organizations, has assembled a "truth squad" of informed 

experts offering broadcast and print interviews analysing corporate reform legislation 

under intense negotiation in closed-door House-Senate conference committee, with 

a vote expected Thursday. As markets continue their record slide amid WorldCom's 

bankruptcy filing and lack of investor confidence in reforms, many experts are 

calling for the conference to be made public and for intense lobbying by the accounting 

industry to weaken the bill to receive more public scrutiny. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who: <br>

Interview resources include members of Congress, laid off WorldCom and Enron workers 

and leading independent experts who can discuss technical and political dimensions 

of the reform bill, including how it would and would not reform accounting practices, 

impose penalities on corporate wrongdoing, how it would fail to reform abuses 

of employee pensions, overseas tax havens, corporate governance, whistleblower 

rights, reporting on employee stock options, and whether it would offer any mechanism 

at all for making financial restitution to victims of corporate crime. Available 

interview guests on the provisions and omissions of the bill include, among many 

others: </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), 

named to the House Senate conference committee on the reform bill and on the Financial 

Services Committee, lead sponsor of the Enron Employee Pension Recovery Act. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), 

member of the House Ways &amp; Means Committee, longtime proponent of reforming 

corporate tax shelters. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Rep. Dennis Kucinich 

(D-Ohio), a leader of the Progressive Caucus, outspoken advocate of stronger corporate 

reform. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- WorldCom workers across 

the US via Kathy Roeder of the AFL-CIO, which is working with the overwhelmingly 

non-union workers laid off by WorldCom and Enron, demanding the current low ceilings 

on their severance be raised, and that laid off workers be the first in line for 

back pay and severance whenever bankrupt corporation funds are disbursed. </font>
