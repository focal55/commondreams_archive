<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 26 - The 
New York City Council today voted 39 to 12
to call for a moratorium on executions until the death penalty
is investigated for issues of fairness, justice, equality, due
process and cost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Resolution 12A was sponsored by Deputy Majority Leader Bill Perkins
of Harlem, who has long called for such a moratorium.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
&quot;This is a momentous occasion for this Council,&quot; Perkins said.
&quot;With more than 100 innocent Americans sentenced to death since
1973, it is high time we questioned whether or not our judicial 
system is weighing the evidence properly, whether or not racial
factors, economic factors and factors relating to good defense
are what is making the difference in people's cases. A moratorium
on executions is both timely and necessary and we hope that the
Governor will take the resolution to heart and do the right thing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
New York City is the largest of the 73 municipalities that have
adopted resolutions in favor of a moratorium. The resolution calls
for a halt to executions while a commission is set up to study New 
York's death penalty statute.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Approval of the resolution by the City Council followed hearings
held two weeks ago before the Fire and Criminal Justice Committee.
Committee Chair Yvette Clarke noted that two states, Illinois and 
Maryland, have imposed a moratorium on executions and that within
New York State the cities of Buffalo, Rochester and Mt. Vernon and
the towns of Greenburgh and Newcastle have already passed
moratorium resolutions. &quot;People are beginning to realize that a
system that is unfair and plagued with problems should not be
permitted to continue,&quot; Clark said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
&quot;Many disturbing questions have been raised about the use of
the death penalty in the United States since New York reinstated
capital punishment in 1995,&quot; said David Kaczynski, executive
director of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty. &quot;Most states
have experienced grave problems with the death penalty and a
resulting decline in confidence in the criminal justice system.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Kaczynski noted that governors in two states, Gov. George Ryan
of Illinois and Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland, have put a
temporary halt to executions. In Illinois, a commission
recently issued a 207-page report containing 85 recommendations
aimed at preventing the execution of innocent people. In 
Maryland, a report examining the racial aspects of the death
penalty is expected to be released in September.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
&quot;Many of the same questions of fairness and accuracy that have
plagued other death penalty states need to be addressed here in
New York,&quot; said Kaczynski. &quot;Indeed, New York fails to meet most
of the 85 reforms suggested by the Illinois commission. I hope
that New York State can heed this clear call from New York City
and join the other states that have declared a moratorium.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Jane Henderson, co-director of the Quixote Center, said more
than 2,100 groups and municipalities have now called for a
moratorium on executions. &quot;Fourteen states have considered
moratorium legislation within the past year and the Governor
of Maryland just declared the nation's second moratorium,&quot; 
Henderson said. &quot;Every poll conducted on the issue has shown
that a majority of Americans support halting executions. This
changing tide is truly the result of concerned citizens taking
a stand.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
Steven W. Hawkins, executive director of the National Coalition
to Abolish the Death Penalty, commended the New York City Council
for its vote as well as the local organizers who made it happen. 
&quot;Across the United States, the question is not whether we will
put a halt to executions but when,&quot; Hawkins said. &quot;The rapidly
expanding moratorium campaign is the result not of court rulings
nor of principled political leadership on a national level.
Rather, it is the result of determined and effective organizing
at the grassroots level. New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty
and the Quixote Center offer an example of what we need to be
doing in every city, large and small, across the United States.&quot;</font></p>
