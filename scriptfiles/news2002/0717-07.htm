- July 17 - The Bush administration and big electric utilities have announced 
their opposition to a Senate energy bill provision that would increase wind, solar 
and other renewable energy produced by major electric companies to 10 percent 
by 2020. This opposition to one of the lone bright spots in the energy bill comes 
despite findings from the administration's Energy Information Administration (EIA) 
and new data from the Union of Concerned Scientists that show that the provision 
could be a boon for consumers and the economy.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bush's opposition to the renewable electricity standard makes no sense 
given that its own study shows that the renewable electricity standard would actually 
save consumers billions of dollars,&quot; said Alan Nogee, UCS Clean Energy Program 
Director. &quot;The administration is catering to big utilities that want to continue 
dishing out the same old mix of dirty fossil fuels. The summer air conditioning 
and smog season is a stark reminder of the need to develop clean energy sources.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Senate energy bill includes a renewable electricity standard that requires 
major electric companies to increase sales of electricity from wind, solar and 
other renewable sources from 2 percent today to about 10 percent by 2020. This 
would result in a quadrupling, by 2020, of the amount of clean, renewable energy 
produced. The 74,000 megawatts of renewable energy that would be online by 2020 
would be enough to power about 53 million homes. Twelve states, including Texas, 
have enacted their own renewable electricity standards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Because of the Texas renewable electricity standard that President Bush 
signed when he was Governor of Texas, the amount of wind turbines built in Texas 
last year was more than those built in the entire U.S. in any year,&quot; Nogee 
said. &quot;It's a shame that Bush won't support the clean air, consumer savings 
and energy security benefits that renewable energy could provide on the national 
level.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New research from UCS finds that the Senate's renewable electricity standard 
could save consumers nearly $3 billion through 2020. Recent analysis by the Bush 
EIA shows that a more comprehensive 10 percent renewable electricity standard 
than the one included in the Senate energy bill would save consumers over $13 
billion through 2020 on reduced energy bills. Despite this evidence, Secretary 
of Energy Spencer Abraham recently sent a letter to Congress stating that the 
administration opposes the federal renewable electricity standard. In addition 
to opposing the consumer-friendly renewable energy standard, utilities and Washington 
are colluding to propose weakening other consumer protections in the electricity 
market.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Energy technologies like wind, solar and bioenergy can also help reduce the 
emissions of heat-trapping gases that are causing global warming, as well as reducing 
smog-forming pollution that fossil-fuel burning power plants emit. These clean 
electricity sources are available throughout United States. For example, Illinois 
has the technical potential to generate all of its current electricity needs from 
renewable power alone.</font></p>
