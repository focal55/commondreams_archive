<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 25 - <i>Following is a statement

by Matthew L. Myers, president, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids:

</i></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last year in the Czech Republic, Philip Morris issued a report

arguing that early smoking deaths had "positive effects" because

they reduce government spending on benefits for the elderly.

Today, at the company's annual meeting in Richmond, outgoing Philip

Morris Chairman and CEO Geoffrey Bible blamed parents, rather than

his company's aggressive marketing, for the problem of youth

smoking. Philip Morris' latest statement shows a cynical disregard

for the facts and is deeply offensive to parents across America.

While Philip Morris may have changed its corporate name to Altria

today, it hasn't changed its deadly practices and refuses to accept

responsibility for the fact that more kids smoke its Marlboro

cigarettes than all other brands combined. Nothing has changed but

the name.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asked at the annual meeting if Philip Morris would get rid of

the Marlboro Man to show that it is serious about being a

responsible company, Bible said it was "simply naive" to think that

eliminating the Marlboro Man would reduce youth smoking. Bible

went on to argue that most youth smokers don't buy cigarettes and

that nine out of ten of them get cigarettes from loose packs left

around by adults. Surveys of youth smokers tell a different story.

According to the 2000 National Youth Tobacco Survey conducted by

the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 58.2 percent

of 9th to 12th graders who had smoked in the past 30 days reported

that they usually purchased their cigarettes -- 33.1 percent

usually bought their cigarettes from a story or vending machine,

while 25.1 percent had somebody else buy cigarettes for them. Just

2.9 percent reported taking them from a store or family member.

Also, if it were true that most kids get their cigarettes from

careless adults, then why do 54.8 percent of youth smokers smoke

Marlboro compared to just 36 percent of adults 26 and older?

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Philip Morris' actions today show once again that, while

claiming to be a changed company, it is in fact willing to do and

say almost anything to block real change that would reduce the

addiction, disease and death caused by its products.
