- May 16 - The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 

Committee (ADC) today called upon the Bush Administration to ensure that 

a number of Americans being held by Israel are given their due process 

rights and are not subjected to mistreatment.  ADC is specifically 

concerned about the fate of California physician Dr. Riad Abdelkarim and 

Trevor Baumgartner of Seattle and three of his colleagues who volunteer 

with the International Solidarity Movement.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Abdelkarim was arrested with Dallel Mohmed who was subsequently 

released.  Ms. Mohmed has reported that Israeli forces subjected the two 

to sleep deprivation and constant shackling and interrogation.  Trevor 

Baumgartner and three other Americans have been detained by Israeli 

forces since May 2nd, when they tried to enter the Church of the 

Nativity to bring food and water to Palestinians under siege there. 

Reports suggest that the four  have been on a hunger strike for the past 

10 days.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADC called upon the State Department to ensure that Americans being held 

by Israel are not subjected to mistreatment, and that the Israeli 

authorities allow them their full human and legal rights.  ADC is aware 

of numerous cases of Arab Americans being tortured while in Israeli 

detention, and being subjected to trials involving secret evidence, 

military judges and inadequate representation.  ADC is also aware of 

numerous instances in which Israeli authorities have refused to 

recognize the American citizenship of Arab Americans in Israel and the 

occupied Palestinian territories.  ADC calls upon the United States 

government to provide equal protection to all of its citizens abroad, 

regardless of their ethnicity and regardless of which state's authority 

they are under.  ADC urges the State Department to do everything in its 

power to ensure that Americans are not subjected to mistreatment while 

in Israeli custody.</font></p>
