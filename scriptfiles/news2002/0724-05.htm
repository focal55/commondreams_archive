- July 24 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force today urged the Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee to approve a women's rights treaty signed by President Jimmy 

Carter in 1980 and stalled in the U.S. Senate for the past 22 years, and to allow 

the full Senate to vote on whether or not to ratify the treaty. The Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee vote is slated for Thursday morning, July 25. Nearly 170 United 

Nations member states, including Saudi Arabia, have ratified the Convention on 

the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The U.S. 

is among a handful of countries--including alleged sponsors of terrorism Iran, 

Syria, Somalia and Sudan--that have refused to ratify CEDAW. </font> 

<P> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Basic equality for women should 

be a no-brainer," said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of the National Gay and 

Lesbian Task Force. "Yet the anti-gay right wing in America has blocked this treaty 

for nearly a quarter century. If President and Laura Bush are serious about supporting 

the rights of women in Afghanistan and other countries, they should urge their 

Republican colleagues in the Senate to ratify CEDAW once and for all." </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> CEDAW has languished in the U.S. 

Senate due to the opposition of right-wing groups and politicians, led by Senator 

Jesse Helms (R-NC). Although CEDAW merely mandates basic equality such as the 

right to own property, get an education, and enter into marriage on an equal basis, 

U.S.-based conservative groups have resisted its ratification by the Senate. The 

Family Research Council alleges that CEDAW "takes aim at family structure and 

morality," while Concerned Women for America calls CEDAW "the Equal Rights Amendment 

on steroids," and warns that it promotes "lesbianism" and "homosexual rights." 

"That CEDAW remains controversial is a stark indication of the true nature of 

conservative forces here at home," Jean said. </font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The U.S. Constitution requires 

that the Senate ratify treaties signed by the President, but since Carter signed 

CEDAW it has languished in the U.S. Senate due to Helms's opposition and that 

of the right wing. Under new leadership, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 

finally held hearings on CEDAW June 13th of this year. In response, right-wing 

groups have pressured the Senate, Secretary of state Colin Powell, and President 

Bush to oppose the treaty. If approved by the Foreign Relations Committee July 

25th, the treaty goes to the full Senate for approval, where it must receive a 

2/3 vote to be ratified. The Task Force has prepared an issue paper on CEDAW and 

the U.S. right-wing's promotion of a reactionary agenda at the United Nations, 

available for download at <A HREF="http://www.ngltf.org/downloads/cedaw.pdf" TARGET="_new">http://www.ngltf.org/downloads/cedaw.pdf</A> 

</font>

<P> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The reality is that the right wing 

fears that these treaties will undermine their own rigid concepts of the family 

and religion," Jean said. "The right wing has used this same anti-woman, anti-gay 

rhetoric to oppose reproductive freedom and equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual 

and transgender (GLBT) people, both here in the U.S. and abroad." </font>

<P> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Those who support equal rights 

and opportunities for women should contact the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 

their two U.S. Senators, and President Bush and urge them to ratify this treaty 

that promotes equal rights for women around the world," Jean continued. "This 

position is not only consistent with the goals expressed by the President and 

First Lady Laura Bush since the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan; it's truly 

the only moral position that the U.S. can take." </font>
