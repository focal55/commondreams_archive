<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 29 - American taxpayers may be 

stuck paying $850 billion in taxes normally paid by the 

super-wealthy if a measure currently before the U.S. Senate becomes 

law, according to a warning issued by Americans for a Fair Estate 

Tax (AFET), a non-partisan coalition of nonprofit organizations 

concerned about repeal of the estate tax. The threat comes from a 

tax plan by Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) to 

permanently mandate that multi-million-dollar estates would never 

have to pay any taxes. The Senate is expected to vote on the issue 

in June. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate should reject the Gramm-Kyl tax plan to permanently 

repeal the estate tax,&quot; said Gary D. Bass of OMB Watch and chair of 

AFET. &quot;We cannot afford to sacrifice Medicare, Social Security, 

education, homeland security and other key national priorities just 

to permanently mandate a special gift to a few multi-million-dollar 

estates at the expense of 98 percent of American taxpayers.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFET last week issued a letter to several thousand of its member 

organizations' constituents, advising them of the danger of the 

Gramm-Kyl estate tax plan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of this large handout to a small handful of 

multi-millionaires at the expense of most Americans, we favor 

common-sense estate tax reform that would protect family farms, 

small businesses and average taxpayers -- without a costly repeal 

that would leave most Americans holding the bag,&quot; said Chuck 

Collins, co-founder of AFET member organization Responsible Wealth, 

the group of small business owners and affluent individuals who 

organized last year's pro-reform statement, signed by Bill Gates 

Sr., Warren Buffett and 1,100 other people personally affected by 

the estate tax. &quot;Repeal of the estate tax is simply unfair and not 

the best way to advance America's priorities.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Permanent repeal of the estate tax means less revenue for the 

country -- $100 billion in the next 10 years and $750 billion in 

the following decade. It would force the government to either raise 

taxes on middle-income taxpayers or cut vital services, such as 

Social Security or prescription drugs for the elderly, just to pay 

for a special windfall for the wealthiest few. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax is applied when individuals leave behind estates 

worth at least $1 million ($2 million for couples) at the time of 

their death. There is no tax on the first $1 million per 

individual, and amounts in excess of $1 million are taxed at 

various rates, starting at 37 percent. As a result of last summer's 

tax legislation, the amount that is exempted from taxation rises to 

$3.5 million ($7 million for couples) and the highest taxable rate 

drops from 55 percent to 45 percent by 2009. In 2010 the estate tax 

is repealed, but is again instituted in 2011. The Gramm-Kyl plan 

would permanently repeal the estate tax. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Repeal of the tax also would have a major harmful impact on 

America's foundations and charities. Estates are allowed to 

transfer unlimited amounts of money to charitable groups, thereby 

helping to reduce the size of the estate that is taxed. In 1999, 

this tax incentive for charitable giving resulted in $14.8 billion 

in contributions to foundations, universities, museums, churches 

and many other charities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even beyond the heavy burden it would place on most taxpayers, 

the Gramm-Kyl tax plan would drain billions of dollars from 

foundations and hard-hit charities that are already struggling to 

serve the most vulnerable Americans,&quot; said Rick Cohen of the 

National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy and AFET. &quot;The 

Gramm-Kyl tax plan is as unfair as it is unwise. It would hurt 

America's charities even as the president and Congress are looking 

to promote charity.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estate tax was already scaled back last summer as part of 

President Bush's sweeping tax package. The Gramm-Kyl tax proposal 

would be far more costly for most American taxpayers as it would 

permanently repeal the tax rather than simply reforming it. Senate 

Majority Leader Tom Daschle has agreed to a vote in the Senate on 

the Gramm-Kyl proposal by June 28. The House will vote on permanent 

repeal of the estate tax for a second time on either June 5 or 6 to 

send a message to the Senate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of AFET's effort to reform rather than repeal the estate 

tax, Responsible Wealth sponsored an ad in the May 20 edition of 

Roll Call and the May 22 edition of The New York Times. Entitled 

&quot;Much Ado About a Very Few,&quot; the ad highlights just how few estates 

would benefit from the costly Gramm-Kyl tax plan -- 24 in Maine, 

for example. Overall, 5,854 multi-millionaires would get a break 

while the remaining taxpayers would have to pick up the tab if the 

measure passes. The ad is available at 

<a href="http://www.responsiblewealth.org" target="_new">http://www.responsiblewealth.org</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFET letter was signed by representatives of a wide range of 

public interest organizations, including AFSCME, American Arts 

Alliance, American Association of University Women, Americans for 

Democratic Action, Campaign for America's Future, Children's 

Defense Fund, Coalition on Human Needs, Evangelical Lutheran Church 

in America -- Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, Independent 

Sector, Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, National Committee for 

Responsive Philanthropy, National Council of Nonprofit 

Associations, National Women's Law Center, NETWORK (National 

Catholic Social Justice Lobby), OMB Watch, Responsible Wealth, 

United for a Fair Economy, and United Church of Christ Justice and 

Witness Ministries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans for a Fair Estate Tax (AFET) is a broad-based 

non-partisan coalition of nonprofit groups, including civic, labor, 

social justice, faith-based, and environmental organizations, as 

well as organizations providing human services. AFET advocates that 

instead of repealing the tax on multi-million-dollar estates, 

Congress should reform the estate tax to ensure that family farms 

and small businesses are not unfairly taxed while keeping 98 

percent of taxpayers exempt and safeguarding Medicare, Social 

Security, education, charities and other key national priorities 

that would be threatened by a complete repeal. More information
