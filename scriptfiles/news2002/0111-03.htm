A contributing editor for <I>Middle East Report</I> and for <I>Goft-o-Gu</I> ("Dialogue" in Farsi), Ehsani -- who is writing a book on Iran -- said today: "A stable

Afghanistan is in Iran's interest. Obviously, Iran is concerned about undue

influence that other powers like the U.S., Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the

Russians, may exercise over the shaping of Afghanistan. It has been precisely

this kind of external unprincipled interference that has destabilized and

reduced Afghanistan to its present state. Iran has also been guilty of

interference there in the past. But it has suffered seriously as a result of

the situation of its neighbor. Remember that for two decades Iran has had to host

2 to 2.5 million refugees from Afghanistan, without any financial help from the

international community. It has suffered from a tremendous drug trafficking

problem and armed cross-border raids and constant instability from its eastern

neighbor. Nor does Iran, quite reasonably, want to see a hostile military

presence on its eastern border in the shape of U.S. troops or their allies, as

it finds such presence on its southern border in the Persian Gulf already quite

threatening. The claim that Al-Qaeda fighters are seeking refuge in Iran seems

to be quite farfetched. It is difficult to believe George Bush's advisors and

informers do not know that doctrinally Al-Qaeda finds Shiite Iran [to be] the

very embodiment of the subversion of true Islam, and as such more evil than the

United States itself! Iran is concerned that the U.S. is acting in Afghanistan

in a way that seems to blatantly ignore and even threaten the legitimate

strategic concerns of its neighbors. The appointment of someone with as

questionable credentials as Zalmay Khalilzad -- a former oil lobbyist for

Unocal, a vocal critic of Iran and a former public supporter of Taliban -- as

the current U.S. envoy to Kabul has certainly not escaped the attention of the

Iranians and cannot be seen as a reassuring move toward stabilizing Afghanistan

by inviting the constructive participation of its neighbors."

Executive director of the Center for International Policy, Goodfellow said today: "To

circumvent Senate opposition to Otto Reich's long-stalled nomination as

assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, the White House

seems poised to give Reich a recess appointment. This procedure, intended for

emergency appointments that cannot wait until Congress returns, would be a

blatant abuse of power by the president and would make a mockery of the advise

and consent provision of the Constitution. The administration has been trying

to shift the focus away from Reich's record by blaming the Senate Foreign

Relations Committee for not scheduling a hearing for Mr. Reich. The real reason

for the delay, however, is the refusal of the administration to respond to the

committee's requests for documents relating to Mr. Reich's career, even such

basic documents as his personnel file from his earlier tenure at the State

Department...."
