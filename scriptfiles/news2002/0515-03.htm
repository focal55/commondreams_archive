- May 15 - Canada's medical marijuana program has been greatly delayed by the U.S. government's refusal to supply standardized marijuana seeds, the Canadian government has reported. Concerned that this may represent deliberate obstructionism, the Marijuana Policy Project yesterday filed a Freedom of Information Act request for information related to the U.S.'s refusal.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Last July the Canadian government announced a new program under which authorized medical marijuana patients would receive medical cannabis grown by Prairie Plant Systems, a private company working under contract for Health Canada, the government agency that oversees Canada's health care system. Testifying before the Health Committee of the House of Commons on May 7, Health Minister Anne McLellan explained that her department sought a supply of tested, standardized marijuana seeds from the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, which maintains a marijuana farm in Mississippi.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   The request was refused after months of negotiations, the Vancouver Sun reported. The paper quoted Assistant Deputy Health Minister Dann Michols as saying that the Drug Enforcement Administration refused to give its approval. An attempt to grow a medical marijuana crop using seeds seized by law enforcement produced unsatisfactory results, delaying patients' access indefinitely. In her testimony, McLellan declined to state when government-authorized medical marijuana would be available.</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rather than lending a hand to our northern neighbors as they sought to gain new scientific knowledge while helping seriously ill citizens, our government seems to have put a roadblock in their path,&quot; said Bruce Mirken, director of communications for the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project. &quot;This raises the possibility that the DEA deliberately tried to obstruct the Canadian program, whose very existence undercuts U.S. government claims that marijuana has no medical value. We would like to think our government wouldn't act in such a manner, but it is important that the truth come out, whatever it may be.&quot;</font></p>

<p>   <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Marijuana Policy Project works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have the approval of their doctors.</i></font></p>
