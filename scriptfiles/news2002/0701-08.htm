- July 1 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) should test raw beef carcasses 
and trimmings for the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7, just like it does 
now for raw ground beef, according to consumer groups who filed a petition with 
USDA today. The groups, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), 
the American Public Health Association, Consumer Federation of America, National 
Consumers League, and Safe Tables Our Priority (STOP), want testing earlier in 
the production process&#8212;so beef contaminated with the deadly pathogen won&#8217;t 
be ground in with un-contaminated beef. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Current government testing for E. coli O157:H7 isn&#8217;t working as 
well as it could or should,&#8221; said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director 
for CSPI. &#8220;USDA should start testing beef carcasses for that deadly bacterium, 
and any carcasses found to be contaminated should be cleaned and retested.&#8221; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E. coli O157:H7 is a dangerous strain of bacteria that can cause acute illness 
and even death, particularly in vulnerable persons such as children, the elderly, 
and those with compromised-immune systems. According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, in 2000, there were 631 cases of food-borne E. coli O157:H7 
infection. Forty percent of those people were hospitalized. A 1992-93 outbreak 
of E. coli O157:H7 in Washington State, due to undercooked hamburgers consumed 
at a restaurant chain, resulted in more than 700 illnesses. Of those, 51 persons 
were hospitalized, 45 developed life-threatening complications, and four died. 
The median age of all afflicted was 8. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because E. coli O157:H7 poses a significant public health concern, USDA has 
established a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy for that pathogen. To keep contaminated 
meat from reaching consumers, USDA annually tests about 7,000 random samples of 
raw ground beef prepared in federally inspected plants and in retail stores. In 
the last two years, between 50 and 60 samples tested positive. Recently, USDA 
Undersecretary Elsa Murano admitted that USDA&#8217;s limited testing program 
for E. coli O157:H7 had &#8220;failed miserably&#8221; in protecting children 
and their families. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Government testing of carcasses and trim would encourage slaughterhouses to 
implement new safety measures, and would result in safer food on America&#8217;s 
tables, say the groups. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;&#8216;Nick of time&#8217; 
testing of ground beef has prevented some outbreaks and illnesses, but has failed 
to prevent numerous others,&#8221; Smith DeWaal said. &#8220;Testing further upstream 
in the production process could help eliminate the hazard before a contaminated 
carcass is processed and contaminates other, safer beef.&#8221; </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
