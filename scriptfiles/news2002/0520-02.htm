of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting here, 21 

prominent scientists from around the world -- among them three 

Nobel Prize winners -- challenged the scientific credibility of 

Japan's &quot;scientific&quot; whaling program and called on the Japanese 

government to halt it. A letter from the scientists was delivered 

today to top officials in Tokyo, including the prime minister. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although Japan's &quot;scientific whaling&quot; program has long been 

criticized within the whaling commission itself, Monday's letter is 

the first definitive scientific judgment from outside the IWC. The 

scientists criticized the country's whaling program, ostensibly 

done as scientific research, as failing to meet &quot;minimum standards 

for credible science.&quot; The letter also ran as a full-page ad in the 

western edition of The New York Times today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The open letter to the Japanese government was signed by marine 

biologists and distinguished scientists such as David Suzuki, Jared 

Diamond, Jane Lubchenco, Sylvia Earle, E.O. Wilson and Nobel 

laureates Sir Aaron Klug and Roger Guillemin. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The letter serves as an independent critique of Japan's 

'scientific whaling' program outside the IWC and it comes from 

world-recognized scientific authorities,&quot; said Richard Mott, vice 

president for international policy at World Wildlife Fund, which 

sponsored the newspaper ad. &quot;We are pleased to see so many 

luminaries in the science world defending science so forcefully.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite a global moratorium imposed by the IWC in 1986, Japan 

has continued to hunt whales, using a loophole in the moratorium 

that allows the killing of whales for scientific research. But 

Japan has never allowed outside experts to review its results. And 

the country distributes its whale quota among commercial whaling 

interests, which sell the whale meat to upscale stores and 

restaurants in Japan. &quot;The commercial nature of Japan's whaling 

program conflicts with its scientific independence,&quot; the 

scientists' letter says. &quot;Most of the data being gathered by 

Japan's 'scientific whaling' are obtainable by non-lethal means. 

Yet Japan's whale research program kills hundreds of whales each 

year in the absence of a compelling scientific need.&quot; </font></p>
