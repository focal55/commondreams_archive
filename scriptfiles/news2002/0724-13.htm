Executive director of the Financial Markets Center, Schlesinger said today: "New 

information about the role of large financial holding companies in the Enron debacle 

raises questions about the effects of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), a 1999 

law that completed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and permitted firms like 

Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase to combine banking, securities and insurance operations 

under one roof. The dealings between Enron and its banks also highlight another 

key question: <i>Where were the regulators?</i> This question applies most directly 

to the Federal Reserve, which received umbrella supervision authority over all 

financial holding company activities under GLBA." The Financial Markets Center 

web site -- <A HREF="http://www.fmcenter.org/pdf/dec99.pdf" target="_new">www.fmcenter.org/pdf/dec99.pdf</A> 

-- contains an overall critique of GLBA written at the time President Clinton 

signed the law. Also see: <A HREF="http://www.fmcenter.org/fmc_superpage.asp?ID=245" target="_new">

Professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and author of the

forthcoming book <i>Contours of Descent: U.S. Economic Fractures and the

Landscape of Global Austerity</i>, Pollin said today: "The fraud and

accounting scandals are not the cause of the financial crisis, but rather a

consequence of it. No one seemed to care about loose accounting practices as

long as the stock market was going up. Only when investors realized that stock

prices were not going to continue to go up, and they had to rely on earnings,

did it become apparent that the earnings were simply not there. The stock

prices were at historical highs at the end of the 1990s, even if the bogus

profit numbers had been true. Historically, the average price-earnings ratio is

about 15:1. In 1999, it was about 42:1 based on companies' reported earnings.

One of the major factors in driving the bubble was the deregulation of

financial markets. For example, Clinton's Treasury secretary, Robert Rubin,

presided over the deregulation of the banking industry. Now he's heading up

Citicorp. The type of fraudulent activity that corporate leaders have engaged

in would clearly have been far more difficult within a reasonably functioning

regulatory environment."</p>

Director of policy strategies at the Pensions Rights Center, Friedman said today: 

"It's crucial that any legislation on 401(k)s do the following: limit over-concentration 

of employer stock in 401(k) plans; hold company officials accountable for their 

unlawful actions; require worker representation on 401(k) plan boards of trustees; 

assure that 401(k) trustees are insured if a court finds that they acted unlawfully; 

and provide whistle-blower protection for employees who protest unlawful 401(k) 

actions...."</p></p> </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center">###</p>
