<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 25 -The Alliance to Save

Energy today gave the U.S. Senate a "D-plus" for making a "pitiful

showing" on energy efficiency in its major energy bill (S. 517).

By a vote of 52-47, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by Sen.

Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) which significantly weakened the bill's

efficiency standards for central air conditioners.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"By voting today for the Harkin amendment, the Senate voted for

more power plants, more pollution, and more money out of consumers'

pockets," said Alliance to Save Energy President David M. Nemtzow.

"It's a sorry day when the Senate votes down such a common-sense

provision."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate also rejected, 57-42, an amendment by Senators Tom

Carper (D-Del.) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) which would have required

the Department of Transportation to reduce gasoline consumption by

one million barrels of oil a day by 2015.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These two provisions would have protected the nation's economic

security, bolstered the reliability of the electric system, saved

consumers billions of dollars, and significantly reduced

pollution," Nemtzow said.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Senate has failed on fuel economy, missing an important

opportunity to save more oil than the U.S. currently imports from

Iraq and Kuwait combined," Nemtzow continued. "The amendment was

no substitute for the fuel economy provision stripped from the

original energy bill. But in failing to rise to the challenge of

our severe vulnerability to oil supply disruption, the Senate has

failed the American people.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"On energy efficiency, the Senate energy bill is redeemed only

by its $3 billion tax package, an increased authorization for

energy efficiency programs, and new, tough energy efficiency

requirements for federal buildings and facilities," Nemtzow said.

The tax package includes tax credits for energy-efficient homes,

washers, refrigerators, heating and cooling systems, windows, and

insulation, and a tax deduction for investment in efficient

commercial buildings.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate joined the House in failing to provide a Public

Benefits Fund that would have attacked energy waste in the

electricity sector and reduced the need for construction of

hundreds new power plants in the next 20 years.
