- June 14 - The Interfaith Alliance today spoke out in response to remarks made 
by a Southern Baptist minister that attacked Islam and its foundations, citing 
the attacks as an attempt to divide the religious community.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As reported by the Associated Press (6/12/02), Rev. Jerry Vines, a former Southern 
Baptist convention president, told guests at a pastors' conference on Monday that 
many of this country's problems can be blamed on religious pluralism. Pluralists 
&#8220;would have us to believe that Islam is just as good as Christianity, but 
I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that Islam is not just as good as 
Christianity.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vines, pastor of First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Fla., reportedly told 
several thousand delegates at the gathering in St. Louis that &#8220;Islam was 
founded by Muhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives - and his last 
one was a 9-year-old girl. And I will tell you Allah is not Jehovah either. Jehovah's 
not going to turn you into a terrorist that'll try to bomb people and take the 
lives of thousands and thousands of people.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. David Currie, Executive Director of Texas Baptists Committed and a board 
member with The Interfaith Alliance responded to Vines&#8217; remarks with dismay, 
&#8221;As a Southern Baptist, I find Rev. Vines&#8217; words to be grossly inappropriate. 
They demonstrate insensitivity to people of the Muslim faith and to those Christians 
worldwide who are attempting to share Christ in Muslim countries. It is never 
appropriate to share Christ by insulting another religion.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Rev. Vines&#8217;statement opposing religious pluralism reflect a further 
distancing of Southern Baptist leaders from historical Baptist traditions. Historically, 
Baptists have been passionate supporters of religious liberty and its corollaries 
of church/state separation and have had an appreciation of pluralism,&#8221; said 
the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, Executive Director of The Interfaith Alliance, practicing 
Baptist pastor for over 40 years and former member of the Executive Committee 
of the Southern Baptist Convention. &#8220;This kind of comment from a religious 
leader perpetuates the image of Christianity as a divisive force in our society 
rather than as a healing and reconciling force.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I think it is always appropriate for people to speak of their understanding 
of God, but it is offensive and audacious to presume an ability to define someone 
else&#8217;s deity,&#8221; added Gaddy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rev. Jack Graham, elected the convention&#8217;s president on Tuesday, 
has rejected calls to repudiate the remarks, saying the Rev. Jerry Vines&#8217; 
comments about Islam were &#8220;accurate.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan clergy-led grassroots organization 
dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of 
the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, 
divisive agenda.</i></font></p>
