<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNITED NATIONS - July 25 

- The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) welcomes the announcement made today 

by the European Commission to strengthen its support for sexual and reproductive 

health in 22 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The 

$32 million joint project will be carried out by UNFPA in partnership with the 

European Union (EU) and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) 

to provide the targeted countries with family planning services and advice on 

population and health issues. Of the total amount, UNFPA is expected to receive 

approximately $20 million. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The resources will allow us to help 

women in these countries plan their families, have safe pregnancies and deliveries, 

and protect themselves from HIV infection," said Thoraya Obaid, executive director 

of UNFPA. "We are very pleased with the European Commission's decision, especially 

following the recent announcement by the United States Administration to withhold 

funds from UNFPA this year." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The funding for the new three-and-a-half 

year reproductive health initiative to serve 22 African, Caribbean and Pacific 

nations was negotiated over the past year. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We are very grateful to our staunch 

partners in the EU for their generous support of multi-country reproductive health 

initiatives, including the successful initiative in Asia, and we thank Poul Nielson, 

the European Commissioner of Development and Humanitarian Aid, who has long been 

a supporter of reproductive health, women's empowerment and UNFPA," said Obaid. 

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNFPA is currently engaged in a special 

fund-raising campaign to increase resources for its core programmes in all of 

the 142 developing countries it helps. "The gap left by the withdrawal of U.S. 

funding must still be filled," said Obaid. "We call on our partners to urgently 

support poor women and families. Unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions and HIV 

prevention will not wait. We cannot allow poor women to suffer, and die, because 

they cannot get the care they need. Together we must remain committed to the Cairo 

Programme of Action on Population and Development to ensure universal access to 

reproductive health services by 2015." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>UNFPA is the world's largest multilateral 

source of population assistance, with programs in 142 countries. Since it became 

operational in 1969, the Fund has provided some $5.6 billion to developing countries 

to meet reproductive health needs and support sustainable development. </i> </font></p>
