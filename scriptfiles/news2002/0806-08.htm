<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 6 - 

A prominent American Muslim civil rights and advocacy group is again calling on 

mainstream political and religious leaders to speak out against the growing number 

of extremist right-wing and evangelical commentators who seek to demonize Islam 

and Muslims. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That call from the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) 

came after another attack on Islam by Christian evangelist Franklin Graham. In 

two media appearances yesterday, Graham said terrorism is part of &quot;mainstream&quot; 

Islam and claimed the Quran, Islam's revealed text, &quot;preaches violence.&quot; 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Fox News cable network's &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; program, Graham, 

after repeatedly refusing to deny that Islam is &quot;evil,&quot; said: &quot;I 

think it's (terrorism) more mainstream. And it's not just a handful of extremists. 

If you buy the Koran, read it for yourself, and it's in there. The violence that 

it preaches is there.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hannity responded by saying: &quot;But this then raises a question. If this 

is not, reverend, the extremist fanatical interpretation of the Quran, then we 

do have a big problem.&quot; Graham replied: &quot;Big problem.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier in the day, Graham appeared on Hannity's nationally-syndicated radio 

program where he made similar remarks and claimed that Muslim leaders have failed 

to condemn terrorism, despite the fact that all major American Muslim groups condemned 

the 9/11 attacks and other acts of terrorism. When a Muslim caller tried to offer 

a balancing view, Hannity cut his microphone. When other callers openly stated 

that &quot;Islam is evil,&quot; neither Graham nor Hannity challenged those bigoted 

views. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Mainstream political leaders and religious figures must speak out against 

the growing demonization of Islam by extremist right-wing commentators and by 

representatives of the evangelical Christian community. Defamatory attacks on 

other faiths can only lead to a spiral of distrust and intolerance that will divide 

our society along religious lines,&quot; said CAIR Communications Director Ibrahim 

Hooper. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hooper quoted the Quran, which states: &quot;Invite (all) to the way of thy 

Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are 

best and most gracious.&quot; (16:125) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In November of last year, CAIR requested a meeting with Graham to discuss his 

remarks that attacked Islam as an &quot;evil and wicked religion.&quot; Graham 

did not reply to that request. Franklin Graham is the son of Billy Graham, an 

internationally-known minister who has counseled a number of world leaders. The 

younger Graham offered the benediction at President Bush's swearing-in ceremony. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In June, leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) refused to repudiate 

anti-Muslim statements made at the group's annual conference. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The American Muslim Political Coordination Council (AMPCC), made up of the 

nation's four most prominent Muslim political advocacy groups, is calling on all 

faith communities to participate in the national observance by opening houses 

of worship on September 11, 2002, for interfaith visits, prayers, congregational 

exchanges, and other activities intended to foster national unity and religious 

tolerance. The AMPCC consists of American Muslim Alliance (AMA), American Muslim 

Council (AMC), Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and Muslim Public 

Affairs Council (MPAC). </font></p>
