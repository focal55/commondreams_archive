- April 24 - Hundreds of thousands of 

Midwest welfare recipients have gone to work since 1996, but most 

have taken jobs that pay low wages, are part-time, or don't last, 

according to a major report released today by the Joyce Foundation. 

As a result, most of those who have made the transition from 

welfare to work remain poor. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These findings and recommendations were released today in 

&quot;Welfare to Work: What Have We Learned?&quot; The report presents 

leading research on welfare-to-work initiatives in Illinois, 

Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Midwest 

states have been innovators on welfare policy both before and since 

the 1996 national welfare reform. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We hope policymakers will use this information to build on the 

gains of the last five years, stabilize working families, help them 

weather economic downturns, and provide the supports they need to 

climb out of poverty,&quot; said Ellen Alberding, president of the Joyce 

Foundation. &quot;Meanwhile, we need strategies to reach out to the 

poorest families still untouched by policy reforms or national 

prosperity.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report's major findings include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Caseloads have declined across the board 

-- Part-time and temporary work and low wages leave families in 

most states below the federal poverty level for a family of three. 

-- Hunger, lack of health care, and other hardships affect many 

families. 

-- Many former recipients express satisfaction about getting 

jobs. 

-- Programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and subsidized 

childcare help many working families, but others are not getting 

information about available assistance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The research also shows most who left welfare for work cycled in 

and out of low-wage jobs. Others faced serious barriers, including 

health and mental health problems preventing them from taking jobs 

despite the pressure to do so. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Report recommendations include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Invest in effective education and training. 

-- Maintain funding levels 

-- Restructure the safety net to build supports around work 

-- Maintain state innovation and flexibility to help individual 

families </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Joyce Foundation has invested over $8 million in research to 

study the effects of welfare reform in the Midwest. Based in 

Chicago with assets of just under $800 million, the Foundation 

supports efforts to strengthen public policies in ways that improve 

the quality of life in the Great Lakes region. </font></p>
