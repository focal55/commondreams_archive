- May 3 - The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit today upheld EPA clean air rules that will dramatically reduce air pollution emitted by heavy-duty trucks and buses starting in 2007.  The rules were finalized in the last days of the Clinton Administration, and were attacked in court by the diesel engine manufacturers and the oil refiners.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hundreds of thousands of Americans will live longer and healthier lives as a result of these new truck and bus standards,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Clean Cars Advocate Emily Figdor.  &quot;Our days of tolerating thick, black belches of truck exhaust on city streets and highways are coming to an end,&quot; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May 2000, the U.S. EPA proposed new soot and smog emission standards for heavy-duty trucks and buses.  The new standards, which take effect in 2007, require new heavy-duty engines to be more than 90 percent less polluting than they are today.  In order to meet these emission standards, the diesel

fuel must also be clean.   Therefore, the rules require oil refiners to

eliminate much of the sulfur that currently contaminates diesel fuel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These rules, combined with the new clean car standards adopted last year, are the most significant vehicle pollution steps since eliminating lead from gasoline,&quot; said Figdor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The State PIRGs campaigned to support the EPA's proposal.  More than 82,000 Americans spoke up in favor of the new standards by sending e-mails, postcards and letters to the Administration.  During the five public hearings during the summer of 2000, U.S. EPA officials were overwhelmed by the number of citizens in attendance to support the tough new rules.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Cleaning up the pollution from trucks and buses will prevent health problems ranging from asthma attacks to cancer and premature death,&quot; said Figdor.  &quot;The public won a significant victory today.&quot;</font></p>
