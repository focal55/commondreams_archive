- May 10 - &quot;Once again, lawmakers 

have needlessly jeopardized the health, lives and dignity of 

American servicewomen and dependents stationed overseas by blocking 

their access to safe abortion services,&quot; stated NARAL President 

Kate Michelman. By a vote of 215 to 202, the House defeated an 

amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill offered 

by Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) that would have repealed the 

current ban on privately funded abortions at overseas military 

facilities. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Women willing to sacrifice their lives for this country should 

not have to forego basic healthcare services overseas,&quot; stated 

Michelman. &quot;Anti-choice lawmakers are denying women the very 

liberties they are committed to defending.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;American military women deserve the same options available to 

women here at home. They are serving abroad to protect and defend 

the rights they themselves are continuously denied as 

servicewomen.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: The Sanchez amendment would lift the current-law ban 

on privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals. The 

amendment would not require the Department of Defense to pay for 

abortions, nor would it affect current policies that permit 

military personnel who object to abortion not to participate in the 

procedure. </font></p>
