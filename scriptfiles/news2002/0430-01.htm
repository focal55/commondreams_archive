- April 30 - News Advisory:

<p>Rev. Al Sharpton and Rev. Horace Sheffield III of the

National Action Network will lead two demonstrations in

New York today.

<p>The first demonstration will take place in Middletown, N.Y.,

at 10 a.m. this morning (Tuesday, April 30) outside of the

headquarters of Mediacom Communications Corporation, 100 Crystal

Run Road, Middletown, N.Y. The second demonstration will occur

this afternoon at 2 p.m. at the Sky Forum conference outside of

the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City.

<p>Both demonstrations are part of a National Action Network

national campaign to have the nation's TV satellite and cable

broadcasting industry provide more positive programming for

African Americans.

<p>Sheffield, the president of the Michigan Chapter of the

National Action Network (NAN), says that NAN attempts to opened

dialogue with Mediacom were rebuffed and NAN was forced to conduct

a direct action protest against Mediacom.

<p>Sheffield commented on the reasons NAN has targeted Mediacom:

"We have traveled the nation protesting and negotiating to open the

door of positive programming for African Americans in the satellite

TV and cable broadcasting industry. Cable giants such as Comcast

Cable, Charter Communications and AT &amp; T have set the tone for

corporate responsibility by agreeing to carry positive programming

such as The Word Network. Mediacom CEO Rocco Commisso has not

returned calls nor communicated in a respectful manner. That is

why NAN has commenced direct action against Mediacom," said

Sheffield.

<p>Previous NAN demonstrations in Washington, D.C., St. Louis and

Denver have attracted hundreds that marched in protest with some

demonstrators being jailed for civil disobedience. The

demonstrations were protests against the lack of positive

programming for African Americans and the exclusion of The Word a

religious network that broadcasts to millions of African Americans

daily.
