ANGELES - August 8 - Drivers along Los Angeles' famous Sunset Boulevard may be 

surprised tomorrow to see a herd of African elephants looking down on them from 

a massive 18' by 48' billboard, as seen through the gun sights of ivory poachers, 

with the message: &quot;Stop the Slaughter! www.ifaw.org.&quot; The hard-hitting 

imagery of the billboard heralds the launch of a major new international campaign 

to protect elephants from the ivory trade by the International Fund for Animal 

Welfare (IFAW -- (http://www.ifaw.org), the world's leading animal welfare organization. 

</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's ironic that this billboard is on Sunset Boulevard because the sun 

may be setting on the future of the African elephants. We need to act now to save 

them,&quot; said IFAW President Fred O'Regan. Five Southern African countries 

have announced plans to sell thousands of pounds of ivory in one-off stockpile 

sales, as well as the yearly sale of additional elephant ivory. Some nations have 

even gone so far as to call for the legal sale of elephant skins and meat. &quot;Half 

of Africa's elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in the 1980s and early 

'90s,&quot; said O'Regan, &quot;We cannot allow this to happen again. We are calling 

on the public to visit ifaw.org, where they can send protest postcards to these 

governments.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of IFAW's most influential supporters in Los Angeles and New York donated 

the billboard space, design and related creative elements. &quot;We're thrilled 

to be a part of this campaign,&quot; said Brian Kennedy, president of Regency 

Outdoor, which donated the billboard space. &quot;We hope this message will encourage 

residents and visitors to Los Angeles to take a moment and consider what each 

of us can do to help out.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We're privileged to be involved,&quot; said Michael Burns, vice chairman, 

Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., and a key leader of the IFAW effort. &quot;This 

is about each of us stepping forward and doing what we can to ensure that future 

generations have the chance to see these majestic creatures in the wild, not just 

in zoos and picture books.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The billboard will remain at Sunset Boulevard and Horn Avenue for the month 

of August. IFAW plans further campaign events in Los Angeles and internationally 

over the next several months, through its 13 country offices. &quot;This issue 

is a global one,&quot; said O'Regan, &quot;and so is the IFAW campaign.&quot;
