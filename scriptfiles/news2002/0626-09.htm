<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 26 - In 
the wake of two landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings, activists from across the 
country will converge on Washington, D.C. for five days of activities aimed at 
raising public awareness about the death penalty. The activities, scheduled for 
Friday, June 28 through Tuesday, July 2, commemorate the historic 1972 and 1976 
Supreme Court rulings that suspended the death penalty in the United States and 
later allowed executions to resume.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Organized by the Abolitionist 
Action Committee (AAC) and endorsed by the National Coalition to Abolish the Death 
Penalty, the main event will be a fast and vigil on the sidewalk in front of the 
U.S. Supreme Court beginning at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, June 29 and ending at midnight, 
July 2. June 29 marks the 30th anniversary of the Furman v. Georgia decision suspending 
executions, while July 2 marks the 26th anniversary of the Gregg v. Georgia ruling 
allowing executions to resume.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ATTENTION REPORTERS, EDITORS 
AND PRODUCERS: A noon rally will be held Monday, July 1 on the sidewalk in front 
of the Supreme Court. Photo-ops will be available as well as spokespeople to comment 
on the Supreme Court's recent rulings and overall trends relating to the death 
penalty in the United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On Friday, June 28, seven 
abolitionists arrested in January for unfurling a banner reading &quot;Stop Executions!&quot; 
on the steps of the Supreme Court will go on trial in D.C. Superior Court. Such 
speech is not allowed on the Supreme Court steps. The trial is scheduled to begin 
at 8:30 a.m. before Judge Gerald Fisher in Courtroom 217 or 218 on the second 
floor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Abe Bonowitz, spokesman 
for the Abolitionist Action Committee, said the primary goal of the fast and vigil 
is to educate the public. &quot;We are going to maintain a presence at the Supreme 
Court between the dates of the anniversaries of when the death penalty was ruled 
unconstitutional in practice in 1972 and when new laws were upheld in 1976,&quot; 
Bonowitz explained. &quot;We are going to educate the public about the death penalty 
and ask people to stand with us against our nation's culture of violence and for 
alternatives to the death penalty.&quot;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The death penalty 
in 1972 was arbitrary and capricious,&quot; said Steven W. Hawkins, executive 
director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;The death 
penalty in 2002 is arbitrary and capricious. The difference between 1972 and 2002 
is that the abolition movement in the United States is now committed to a strategy 
of legislative repeal - organizing on a grassroots level, state by state, legislature 
by legislature. It is no longer a question of whether we will abolish the death 
penalty, but when.&quot;</font></p>
