- May 21 - Ralph Nader today dubbed 

the agreement between New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and 

Merrill Lynch &quot;grossly inadequate&quot; to protect investors. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I call on Attorney General Spitzer to reconsider his framework 

reached with Merrill Lynch as it insufficiently protects investors 

and shareholders,&quot; said Nader. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This agreement leaves shareholders unprotected for several 

reasons: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. It denies restitution to investors who were harmed. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. By allowing Merrill Lynch to avoid admitting wrongdoing, this 

deal makes it much more difficult for investors to recover in 

private civil litigations. Spitzer agreed to the following phrase 

by Merrill Lynch regarding the agreement: &quot;(It) represents neither 

evidence nor admission of wrongdoing or liability&quot;. Said Nader: 

&quot;This betrays Spitzer's own standards that he insisted on -- an 

admission of wrongdoing -- as a condition for Merrill Lynch to avoid 

criminal prosecution. &quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Any deal with Merrill Lynch or any other brokerage should 

require that investment banks divest their analyst divisions that 

provide investment advice to the public. There needs to be a 

complete separation of analyst and investment banking functions to 

protect investors. This deal does not achieve this. Only if 

analysts are entirely independent of investment bankers can 

investors be confident they are receiving objective advice. 

&quot;Spitzer's deal even allows analysts to continue to attend 

investment banking roadshows,&quot; said Nader. &quot;Investors should hang 

onto their wallets.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Nader criticized Spitzer for commending Merrill Lynch in a 

press release announcing the settlement. &quot;You don't commend 

someone who has just deceived investors into huge losses for their 

own investment banking fees benefit,&quot; said Nader. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Nader also urged Spitzer to appoint a monitor to oversee 

Merrill Lynch's compliance that has no ties to the securities or 

accounting industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the evidence that continued to flow in to Attorney General 

Spitzers investigators and given the magnitude of the wrongdoing, 

Spitzer's concessions to Merrill Lynch not only weaken his own 

enforcement action, but provide gratuitous obstacles to innocent 

investors who are intent on securing restitution for their losses,&quot; 

said Nader. &quot;A tiny fraction of the losses by investors directly 

attributable to Merrill Lynch's deceptions is encompassed in the 

fine of $100 million that goes not to investors, but to the 

states.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a swank political dinner in Washington recently, the joke 

circulating was that there is a new axis of evil: Enron, Arthur 

Anderson and Merrill Lynch. For millions of retirees, workers and 

investors, this is no joke. Just weeks ago, the cover page of 

Business Week asked &quot;How corrupt is Wall Street.&quot; The article 

inside answered the question by demonstrating that Wall Street is 

seriously corrupt. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even as Spitzer is inking a deal to absolve Merrill Lynch of 

ultimate responsibility for duping investors, Congress has not even 

begun to seriously address reforms that would ensure that Enron, 

Arthur Anderson, Merrill Lynch and other corporate misdeeds are not 

repeated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nader called for Congress, the SEC and the Attorneys General to 

get behind the following reforms as the only way to protect 

investors: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. Total public funding of all elections. No more 

Enron-purchased politicians. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B. Restore New Deal protections that investors, retirees, 

savers and workers are entitled to. The shredding of the New Deal 

investor and retiree safety net begat Enron, Anderson and Merrill 

Lynch. Repeal all legislation that has undermined New Deal 

safeguards in the last decade: consumer, securities, and banking 

deregulation in particular must be reversed. Broaden protections 

to encompass evolving financial institutions that did not exist 

during the New Deal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C. Demand Globalization of investor and retiree protections. 

Financial statements must be understandable and comprehensive 

around the globe; firms that violate this prerequisite to investing 

must be subject to criminal penalties and lose access to American 

financial markets. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">D. Get tough on corporate crime. Heightened criminal penalties 

for financial crimes equal to the toughest federal and state 

penalties for street crimes related to property and not involving 

violence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E. An Independent Prosecutor for Merrill Lynch, Enron, Global 

Crossing and progeny. An Independent Prosecutor is needed for any 

situation where the majority of either Congress or the lead 

investigating committee has received contributions from either the 

target or its accounting firm or underwriters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, Nader said there was a critical need for investors 

to band together and organize their own Financial Consumer 

Associations (FCAs) as watchdogs to represent them before 

regulatory bodies and in the courts in negotiations with securities 

firms and other financial services providers. The FCAs would be 

nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations supported by member dues and 

receive no tax money. The members would elect a board of directors 

which could hire researchers, organizers, accountants and lawyers. </font></p>
