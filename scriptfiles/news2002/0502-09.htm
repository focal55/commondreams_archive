<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 2 - The Council on American-Islamic Relations 

(CAIR) today condemned planned congressional resolutions in support of 

Israel's brutal invasion of Palestinian territory that the Islamic advocacy 

group said amounted to American elected officials &quot;pledging allegiance&quot; to 

a foreign government.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite President Bush's assertion that such a move would negatively-impact 

American foreign policy interests, Democratic and Republican congressional 

leaders say they would today go ahead with votes on the pro-Israel 

resolutions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yesterday, White House spokesman Ari Fliescher said the president is 

concerned that &quot;no foreign policy can survive 535 different secretaries of 

state.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Associated Press reports that the administration urged that if introduced, 

the resolutions should at least make reference to the need to &quot;alleviate 

the occupation of the suffering Palestinian people.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A statement by CAIR Executive Director Nihad Awad read in part:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is truly disturbing to see American elected officials falling over 

themselves in an unseemly attempt to 'pledge allegiance' to a foreign 

government and its domestic lobby. Perhaps these same politicians should be 

reminded that they were elected by American, not Israeli voters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At a time when the president and secretary of state are trying to 

encourage peace and stability in the Middle East, our elected 

representatives are undercutting that effort by engaging in crass political 

maneuvering that promotes their own prospects of re-election over America's 

national and security interests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans should not offer unconditional support to a brutal invasion that 

even the Israelis admit involved killings of noncombatants, looting by 

soldiers, denial of relief supplies to entire population centers, and the 

use of Palestinian civilians as human shields in military operations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Awad added that the one-sided congressional resolutions send a false 

message to the Muslim and Arab world that the American people do not 

support justice, human rights or a peaceful resolution to the Middle East 

conflict. He cited a recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll in which 71 percent 

of respondents said the U.S. government should not take either side in the 

Mideast conflict and asked voters to make their representatives aware of 

that fact.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most strongly-worded congressional resolution is being sponsored by 

House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), who just last week announced at the 

annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that: &quot;As 

long as I'm in Congress, I'll use every tool at my disposal to ensure that 

the Republican conference in the House of Representatives continues to 

preserve and strengthen America's alliance with the state of Israel.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last night on the MSNBC cable news network, House Majority Leader Dick 

Armey (R-TX) went further than even right-wing Israeli politicians by 

calling for the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people from the 

Occupied Territories.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These statements, and the rush to introduce the non-binding resolutions, 

are viewed by many political observers as an effort by both major parties 

to out-bid each other in appealing to Jewish voters and campaign contributors.</font></p>
