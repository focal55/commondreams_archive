<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - August 3 - A 

new law supposedly protecting U.S. servicemembers from the International Criminal 

Court shows that the Bush administration will stop at nothing in its campaign 

against the court, Human Rights Watch warned today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S. President George Bush 

today signed into law the American Servicemembers Protection Act of 2002, which 

is intended to intimidate countries that ratify the treaty for the International 

Criminal Court (ICC). The new law authorizes the use of military force to liberate 

any American or citizen of a U.S.-allied country being held by the court, which 

is located in The Hague. This provision, dubbed the "Hague invasion clause," has 

caused a strong reaction from U.S. allies around the world, particularly in the 

Netherlands. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, the law provides 

for the withdrawal of U.S. military assistance from countries ratifying the ICC 

treaty, and restricts U.S. participation in United Nations peacekeeping unless 

the United States obtains immunity from prosecution. At the same time, these provisions 

can be waived by the president on "national interest" grounds. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The states that have ratified 

this treaty are trying to strengthen the rule of law," said Richard Dicker, director 

of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. "The Bush administration 

is trying to punish them for that." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dicker pointed out that 

many of the ICC's biggest supporters are fragile democracies and countries emerging 

from human rights crises, such as Sierra Leone, Argentina and Fiji. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law is part of a multi-pronged 

U.S. effort against the International Criminal Court. On May 6, in an unprecedented 

move, the Bush administration announced it was "renouncing" U.S. signature on 

the treaty. In June, the administration vetoed continuation of the U.N. peacekeeping 

force in Bosnia in an effort to obtain permanent immunity for U.N. peacekeepers. 

In July, U.S. officials launched a campaign around the world to obtain bilateral 

agreements that would grant immunity for Americans from the court's authority. 

Yesterday, Washington announced that it obtained such an agreement from Romania. 

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, another provision 

of the bill allows the United States to assist international efforts to bring 

to justice those accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity - 

including efforts by the ICC. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The administration never 

misses an opportunity to gratuitously antagonize its allies on the ICC," said 

Dicker. "But it's also true that the new law has more loopholes than a block of 

Swiss cheese." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dicker said the law gives 

the administration discretion to override ASPA's noxious effects on a case-by-case 

basis. Washington may try to use this to strong-arm additional concessions from 

the states that support the court, but Dicker urged states supporting the ICC 

"not to fall into the U.S. trap: the law does not require any punitive measures." 

</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch believes 

the International Criminal Court has the potential to be the most important human 

rights institution created in 50 years, and urged regional groups of states, such 

as the European Union, to condemn the new law and resist Washington's attempts 

to obtain bilateral exemption arrangements. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law formed part of the 

2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery from and Response to 

Terrorist Attacks on the United States. </font></p>
