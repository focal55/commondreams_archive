<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BETHLEHEM - May 15 - Five Americans--four men and one woman--were illegally detained by the Israeli authorities on May 2nd and May 9, respectively. They are being held in Ramle prison-- a prison notorious for its human rights abuses, especially those against women and children. The Americans have not been charged with any crime. Their detention comes at the height of International humanitarian efforts to deliver food and water to besieged Palestinian civilians. To protest their illegal detention, the Americans have been on hunger strike for over a week (one man for two weeks), and 

have been refusing water for most, if not all, of the last 6 days. The US embassy has consistently refused to help these U.S. citizens and has attempted to force their parents to pay their deportation costs, despite 

the fact that each of them already has a return ticket.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The men were all arrested whilst trying to take humanitarian aid to 

 besieged Palestinian civilians in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem

(now released);</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the American woman, Kristen Schurr, was one of the 10 humanitarian 

 workers who brought food and water into the Church of Nativity-she  

 was detained when the standoff ended. She reports that she is being  

 beaten and repeatedly strip  searched;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> they were arrested by the Israelis in Bethlehem, which is in  'area 

 A,' within which Israel has no legal jurisdiction. Access to legal counsel has

been repeatedly denied to all five;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> all five Americans have agreed to leave the country, yet the Israeli 

 government continues to detain them, and now wishes to interrogate 

 Nathan Musselman.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The five Americans are: Kristen Schurr of New York, NY and Seattle, WA; Trevor Baumgartner of Seattle, WA and Berkeley, CA; Nathan Mauger of Spokane, WA; Thomas Koutsoukos of Lakeforest, IL; and Nathan Musselman of 

Roanoke, VA.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two of the American hostages, Trevor Baumgartner and Thomas Koutsoukos, released a statement from Ramle prison this morning:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We remain in prison because the Ministry of Interior, after making an agreement then breaking it, has been seeking to manipulate our parents and ourselves in to purchasing new flight tickets, rather than letting us use our own as our fellow internationals have, or purchasing them themselves, as is their legal obligation. Toward this end, Nathan Mauger and Nathan Musselman have been separated from us and each other, despite repeated assurances that this would not happen. This morning we were informed that when we leave, Nathan Musselman is to remain behind for interrogation by Shabak (Israeli internal security). We find this wholly unacceptable.&quot;</font></p>
