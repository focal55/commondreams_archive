YORK - September 5 - After September 11, 2001, New York&#8217;s Union Square became 

a center of hope, of grief, of protest and of mourning. On September 11, 2002, 

New Yorkers Say No To War will return to Union Square with these same emotions, 

to honor those who died in last year&#8217;s terrorist attacks and in all subsequent 

U.S. military actions. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 8:46 AM&#8212;exactly 

one year after the first jet struck the World Trade Center&#8212;mourners will 

lay silently on the ground in Union Square Park wearing tee-shirts proclaiming 

their message: Say No To War. Participants will rise and disperse at 10:29 AM, 

the anniversary of the fall of the second tower. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;With our Mourning, 

we are creating a space for New Yorkers to come together in quiet reflection to 

mourn our losses over the past year and to contemplate our political obligations 

going forward,&#8221; said Jennifer L. Pozner, a member of the anti-war group&#8217;s 

planning committee. &#8220;New Yorkers Say No To War mourns the violent loss of 

our friends, our families and our collective sense of safety in New York City 

and across our country. We protest retaliatory U.S. military actions that have 

killed hundreds of innocent Afghan civilians in our names. We protest the brutality 

and arrogance of the Bush administration's &#8216;war without end,&#8217; and 

the massive loss of life that could occur in Iraq and elsewhere throughout the 

world. We protest the racist and anti-democratic profiling of people of color 

and the increasing suspension of American civil liberties in the name of patriotism,&#8221; 

Pozner said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New Yorkers Say No to War, 

which formed immediately after September 11, 2001, is a diverse group of individuals 

meeting to explore alternatives to war in the face of grief, fear and anger following 

the events of September 11. NYSNTW meetings feature presentations by experts and 

artists on topics both local and global, and provide opportunities to share resources, 

insights, creative energies and hope through art and political action. NYSNTW 

seeks urgent, non-violent and constructive solutions that promote peace, equality 

and justice around the world. </font></p>
