<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- September 6 - The Sierra Club today urged Congress to reject the Bush Administration's 

proposed legislation that would increase destructive commercial logging, gut important 

environmental protections under the guise of forest fire prevention, and fail 

to adequately protect communities from fires.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America needs a sound vision for forest management that provides for 

better community protection, responsibly uses federal resources and personnel 

and maintains important environmental safeguards,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive 

Director Carl Pope. &quot;Instead of protecting communities, this legislation 

sells out America's forests to corporate special interests and muzzles the American 

public by squashing their rights to speak out on behalf of forest protection.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) is exploiting this summer's forest 

fires to push an amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill based largely on 

the President's proposal. The amendment would eliminate the effectiveness of important 

environmental laws, including the landmark National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 

that has protected National Forests and other special places for more than three 

decades. NEPA, which was signed into law by President Nixon, ensures that citizens 

have the right to comment on federal projects that impact the environment. Providing 

the American public an opportunity to be included in the management of public 

lands is a basic right that Congress and the Administration should not take away.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Gutting forest protections and eliminating public discourse on controversial 

logging projects will do nothing to address the problem of catastrophic wildfires, 

nor will it protect lives and communities,&quot; said Pope. &quot;The Forest Service's 

priority should be protecting communities, not quenching the timber industry's 

thirst for profit. The timber industry wants to log the larger, more fire-resistant 

trees that will yield a profit, not the smallest trees and underbrush that will 

protect people near at-risk communities.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senator Craig's amendment to the Department of Interior appropriations bill 

also includes language that would prohibit further public input on wilderness 

protection for Alaska's Tongass National Forest -- America's largest and wettest 

National Forest.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When you include a provision to bar public input on protection for the 

Tongass, a rainforest immune from fires, in legislation purportedly aimed at reducing 

fire risk, you call your own bluff,&quot; said Pope. &quot;This is a blatant attempt 

to increase logging in all National Forests and silence the public, regardless 

of fire-risk.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Sierra Club and other environmental groups last month offered a new vision 

for protecting communities. The seven-point plan includes:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do the most important work first. Make protection of communities from firs 

the Forest Service's Number One Priority.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Provide meaningful funding. This program should be a minimum of five years 

and funded at $2 billion a year to go directly to fireproofing homes and removing 

hazardous fuels in the Community Protection Zones.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Match personnel to work. Shift Forest Service personnel skilled in preparing 

brush clearing and thinning projects from backcountry, low priority areas to the 

Community Protection Zones.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carry out immediately the vast majority of fuel reduction projects in the 

Community Protection Zones that raise no significant environmental issues.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Restore natural fires to have natural forests. Prescribed burns can help to 

reduce fuel buildup and restore healthy forest habitats.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Protect our ancient and wild forest from logging and logging roads.&middot; 

Stop the attack on forest protection safeguards</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This plan will protect people and their communities, help reduce the 

likelihood of catastrophic wildfires and keep the wild areas of America's forests 

healthy and unspoiled,&quot; said Pope.
