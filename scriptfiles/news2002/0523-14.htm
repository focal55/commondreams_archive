<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - The field of credible Democrats running for President was significantly narrowed today when two rumored candidates insulted every employed woman, 

every woman in business, and every woman who has been a victim of violence 

in this country. In casting their votes to promote Judge D. Brooks Smith to 

the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, only one step below the Supreme Court, 

rumored candidates Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and Sen. John Edwards, 

D-N.C., disregarded the extensive evidence of unethical behavior and 

discriminatory conduct that caused the Washington Post, New York Times and 

Los Angeles Times to oppose Smith's confirmation.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an embarrassingly convoluted rationale, Biden expressed disappointment 

in Smith's strong criticism of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), but 

said it would be a &quot;double standard&quot; to vote against Smith because Supreme 

Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist held a similar opinion on VAWA. 

Apparently Biden doesn't recall that his vote for Rehnquist was cast many 

years before VAWA was even introduced. As for a &quot;double standard,&quot; someone 

should tell Sen. Biden that double nothing is still nothing. Biden's 

previous leadership on violence against women is just that -- previous. He 

has jettisoned it in favor of friendship -- his stated presumption of 

supporting any nominee sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. No doubt the 

people of Delaware will want to know that they have elected a Republican 

from Pennsylvania to represent them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another Presidential wanna-be, Sen. Edwards, hid out in his office across 

the hall from the hearing, and didn't even have the courage to cast his &quot;Yes&quot; vote in public. Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wisc., joined all of the 

committee Republicans, whose cowardly votes betrayed the women of their 

states by recommending elevation of a judge whose repeated &quot;ethical lapses&quot; 

deserve censure, not promotion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate's reputation as a &quot;Old Boys Club&quot; was reinforced by today's 

vote, in which both of the women on the Judiciary Committee voted against 

Smith, but he won anyway because 12 of the 17 men voted in his favor. To 

promote a judge who will have to decide on cases of discrimination, when 

that judge has himself cavalierly participated in discrimination and even 

ruled in favor of discriminatory practices, is the height of 

irresponsibility by those who are charged with that duty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW commends both of the women who serve on the Judiciary Committee, 

Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., whose 

votes against confirming Smith spoke volumes, as well as Committee Chair 

Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who spoke eloquently about discrimination against 

women, and Senators Richard Durbin, D-Ill., Russ Feingold, D-Wisc., Edward 

Kennedy, D-Mass., and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW intends to seek a filibuster in the Senate against Judge Smith's 

confirmation, and will urge every senator to participate who cares about 

protecting the last 40 years of progress women have made. The Judiciary 

Committee's vote for D. Brooks Smith made a mockery of judicial standards. 

Unless the full Senate reverses, it will send a message to women that they 

can't expect to have civil rights -- or ethics -- taken seriously by Senate 

or the courts.</font></p>
