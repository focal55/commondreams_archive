<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7 May 2002</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Colin L. Powell<br>

Secretary of State<br>

U.S. Department of State<br>

2201 C St NW<br>

Washington, DC 20520</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Honorable Donald H. Rumsfeld<br>

Secretary of Defense<br>

Department of Defense<br>

1000 Defense Pentagon<br>

Washington, DC 20301-1000</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are greatly troubled by Pentagon plans to significantly increase 

engagement with the Indonesian military (TNI). Prudent restrictions on 

military aid to Indonesia, renewed and strengthened by Congress in the FY02 

Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, would in effect be nullified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesian armed forces continue to perpetrate systematic human rights 

violations throughout the archipelago. The Indonesia section of the 2001 

State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices documents 

&quot;shooting of civilians, torture, rape, beatings and other abuse, and 

arbitrary detention&quot; and notes that &quot;the Government rarely holds the 

military or police accountable for committing extrajudicial killings or 

using excessive force.&quot; Rewarding the TNI with US assistance -- while 

crackdowns on civilians continue, and in some cases escalate, and 

resistance to accountability remains overwhelming -- signifies the 

condoning of serious rights violations by the Administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Administration has already lifted the embargo on commercial sales of 

non-lethal defense articles and increased bilateral contacts between the 

militaries, while Congress has agreed to reinstate Expanded International 

Military Education and Training (IMET) for FY02. Yet these initiatives have 

not led to military reform or greater influence in Jakarta, as argued by 

many in the Administration. On the contrary, the Indonesian government has 

been less than cooperative in the &quot;war on terrorism,&quot; largely neglecting 

Administration requests regarding terrorist suspects and their assets. 

Domestic-focused militant jihad groups continue to enjoy protection and 

support from members of the government and military.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are disturbed about the ease with which CINCPAC Admiral Dennis Blair 

overrode Foreign Operations Appropriations jurisdiction and succeeded in 

securing a last-minute addition to the FY02 Defense Department 

Appropriations Act (HR 3338, provision 8125), providing $17.9 million to 

establish a Regional Defense Counter-terrorism Fellowship Program. 

Provision 8125 was clearly an end-run around Foreign Operations 

Appropriations IMET restrictions, although none of the seven conditions 

Congress required to lift the ban have been met.  There are no restrictions 

on which countries can participate in the program, which has an unknown 

curriculum.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FY02 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations request is more troubling 

still. The request for an additional $8 million for the &quot;training of 

civilian and military personnel in support of humanitarian and peacekeeping 

activities in Indonesia&quot; can only be seen as yet another attempt to 

undermine congressional restrictions. Before peacekeeping training should 

even be considered for the TNI, soldiers would do well to stop their 

widespread practice of murder, torture, and rape of civilians. The purpose 

and composition of the $8 million to &quot;vet, train, and equip a 

counter-terrorism unit&quot; is unclear.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Potentially many more millions for defense articles, services, training, 

and other aid could be made available for Indonesia from large pools of 

money for unspecified countries, including  $100 million &quot;to support 

foreign nations.&quot; If the FY02 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations 

requests are honored, the TNI will not only have access to prestigious U.S. 

military training without congressional oversight, but bill language 

providing for defense articles and services to unspecified countries could 

be used to supply Indonesia with banned FMF. We further object to making 

funds &quot;available notwithstanding any other provision of law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the Pentagon is allowed to ignore existing Foreign Operations 

Appropriations restrictions in the FY02 Emergency Supplemental 

Appropriations request, congressional intent will be effectively ignored, 

an unacceptable and fundamentally undemocratic precedent. The message 

coming from Washington to Jakarta will be even more conflicted, rendering 

U.S. support for democracy and human rights in Indonesia even less 

credible.  It is incomprehensible to deny IMET and FMF for the TNI and talk 

about the need for military reform and an end to impunity on the one hand, 

while the same sought-after training, financing, equipment, and services 

are provided in everything but name. The United State's most important 

point of leverage  to foster respect for human rights and accountability 

and encourage military reform  will be lost with little or nothing gained.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is crucial that this leverage is not lost. As organizations working on 

behalf of human rights and social justice, we strongly request that the 

Administration cooperate with Congress to achieve the following: ***The IMET and FMF restrictions for TNI must be respected and 

administration support given for their renewal in FY03. The TNI should not 

receive training under the Regional Defense Counter-terrorism Fellowship 

Program. Funds appropriated through the supplemental request should not be 

used to train the TNI in any form or provide the military with undefined 

defense articles and services. Any clause stating that funds for foreign 

militaries &quot;may be made available notwithstanding any other provision of 

law&quot; should be excised. Throughout the bill, countries eligible for 

specific programs or pots of monies should be specified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">***We object to any military assistance for the TNI. However, if new aid 

programs are implemented, the Pentagon should consult in detail with 

members of Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittees and Foreign 

Relations/International Relations Committees, as well as other interested 

members of Congress, prior to and during any program. These consultations 

should include the curricula and locations of the training.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">***If any training does go forward, the Pentagon should provide Congress 

with verification that those with whom the Pentagon works  whether 

individuals or units of the police or military -- will not use skills 

gained to suppress domestic conflicts. All individuals and units that 

receive training must be vetted for participation in past abuses, and any 

with records of committing human rights violations should not be allowed to 

participate. The U.S. should not assist the TNI in further acts of murder, 

torture, rape, and other abuses in Indonesia.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">***Foreign policy formulation should be returned to the authority of the 

Foreign/International Relations Committees, the Foreign Operations 

Appropriations Subcommittees, and the State Department, where it 

traditionally has resided.

We also ask for clarification of the nature, composition, and purpose of 

the Regional Defense Counter-terrorism Fellowship Program, as well as the 

counter-terrorism unit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank you for your serious consideration. We look forward to your response.</font></p>
