- August 5 - State Circuit Court Judge Kevin Davey today ruled that Florida's 

1999 voucher law violates the state's constitution. The judge ordered an immediate 

injunction barring any students from using vouchers to attend private school this 

year. The decision was hailed by People For the American Way Foundation, which 

has served as a co-counsel in the legal case. PFAWF, which has offices in both 

Miami and Tallahassee, released the following statement: </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Statement by Elliot Mincberg, vice president and legal director, People For 

the American Way Foundation: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We're very pleased that despite the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 

Zelman case, the state circuit court in Florida has struck down its 1999 school 

voucher law under the state constitution. While this ruling is likely to be appealed, 

we urge state officials to turn their attention to the roughly nine out of 10 

Florida children who attend public schools. These elected leaders should work 

to strengthen public schools, instead of embracing gimmicks that divide communities 

and divert scarce tax funds. This ruling should serve as a wake-up call and get 

the state's leaders to refocus on proven reforms that work.&quot; </font></p>
