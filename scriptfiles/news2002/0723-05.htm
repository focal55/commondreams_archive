- July 23 - As the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy opened its New England regional 

meeting today, 25 of the world's leading whale and dolphin scientists joined World 

Wildlife Fund in urging governments, conservation organizations and fishermen 

to work together to address the leading threat to dolphins and whales -- entanglement 

in fishing gear. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New research released at 

a press conference at the New England Aquarium today finds that nearly 60,000 

whales, dolphins and porpoises (classified scientifically as cetaceans) are killed 

each year worldwide by entanglement. That compares with an average killing of 

21,000 whales a year by whalers during the 20th century, a practice that caused 

severe declines in nearly all large whale species. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scientists also agreed 

to form a global rapid response team, the Cetacean Bycatch Action Network, that 

will provide expert assistance to regions where species are in crisis. Working 

on the ground, they will join with fishermen, governments and other stakeholders 

to find solutions that work for individual fisheries. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their call to action, released 

at the press conference, says in part: "Incidental capture in fishing operations 

is the major threat to whales, dolphins and porpoises worldwide. Several species 

and many populations will be lost in the next few decades if nothing is done. 

Urgent national and international action is needed." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"This is the first coordinated 

effort by the world's experts to tackle the global problem of death from entanglement, 

the number one killer of whales and dolphins," said William Reilly, EPA administrator 

in the first Bush administration and chairman of the board of WWF. "Because of 

the urgent need for action, World Wildlife Fund has now made this one of its priorities 

for our marine conservation work." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unintentional deaths of 

whales and dolphins in fishing gear, known as bycatch, has pushed some cetacean 

species to the brink of extinction. In Mexico's Gulf of California, for example, 

up to 15 percent of the critically endangered vaquita population is killed every 

year in fishing nets. With a population of only around 500, the small porpoise 

-- found nowhere else on Earth -- is being decimated by bycatch. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The numbers are staggering: 

my research estimates that at least 150 whales and dolphins die each day after 

being accidentally caught in commercial fisheries," said Dr. Andy Read of the 

Duke University Marine Laboratory and co-chair of the new Cetacean Bycatch Action 

Network, who today released new figures for global bycatch. "There are effective 

solutions being used by some fishermen around the world, but more action is needed 

to apply those lessons learned to other fisheries." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"My experience working with 

fishermen to reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in New England is a good illustration 

of the challenges and opportunities the network will face," said Scott Kraus, 

director of research at the New England Aquarium and a member of the network. 

"Generally, fishermen want to avoid bycatch for economic reasons, so reducing 

bycatch is a win-win situation for fishermen and cetaceans. But one-size-fits-all 

solutions will not work and our network is committed to working toward solutions 

for individual fisheries." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The global response network 

will provide scientific expertise to regions of the world where cetaceans are 

in crisis to help reduce bycatch. It will also play an advisory role to fisheries 

and governments, provide training and promote research and outreach. A website 

launched today, <a href="http://www.cetaceanbycatch.org" target="_new">www.cetaceanbycatch.org</a>, 

will serve as a virtual resource center for scientists to collaborate and share 

their expertise with each other and with governments and fishermen that request 

assistance. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In releasing this call 

to action, we are urging governments worldwide to address this issue as part of 

their fisheries management," said Andy Rosenberg, co-chair of the Cetacean Bycatch 

Action Network and dean of the College of Life Sciences and Agriculture at the 

University of New Hampshire. "The United States has made some progress in mitigating 

bycatch, but we need to show more leadership by helping solve this problem worldwide 

and continuing to improve our own track record." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whales and dolphins can 

become entangled in commonly used fishing gear like gillnets, tangle nets, trammel 

nets, trawl nets and long lines. Solutions to the problem of entanglement vary 

by region and species involved, but can include adding gillnet floats that break 

away when hit by a whale, acoustic "pingers" that warn marine mammals away from 

nets and buoy lines that are less likely to snare whales and dolphins. Fishermen 

have been crucial in developing these successful gear modifications, the scientists 

noted. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WWF has made reducing cetacean 

bycatch a priority of its Ocean Rescue initiative, acting as the global leader 

in safeguarding marine ecosystems and working to end destructive fishing practices, 

stop illegal trade in marine wildlife and reduce pollution on land and sea. WWF's 

Ocean Rescue also promotes innovative market incentives for responsible fishing 

and works to reform government policies that undermine the ocean's web of life.
