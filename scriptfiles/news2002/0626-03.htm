<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - June 26 - Afghan 
President Hamid Karzai should put a stop to the intimidation of former Women's 
Affairs minister, Dr. Sima Samar, Human Rights Watch said today. A formal charge 
of blasphemy against Dr. Samar was dismissed by a Kabul court on Monday, but future 
charges are still possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The blasphemy charge 
against Dr. Samar is part of a larger pattern of threats and intimidation directed 
at legitimate representatives in Afghanistan - and especially women,&quot; said 
LaShawn R. Jefferson, Executive Director of the Women's Rights Division of Human 
Rights Watch. &quot;It seems that in Afghanistan, female leaders who stand up 
to warlords are threatened, while the warlords themselves are given high-level 
government posts.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch has learned 
that Dr. Samar received a summons on June 22 calling for her to appear in a Kabul 
court to face a blasphemy charge. A letter to the editor in a weekly newspaper 
published by Jamiat-e Islami, Payman-e Muhajid (&quot;message of the holy warrior&quot;), 
had previously alleged that Dr. Samar told a Canadian newspaper that she did not 
believe in Sharia (Islamic law). The writer had demanded that she be given &quot;appropriate 
punishment,&quot; and that the judicial authorities carry out an investigation. 
After Dr. Samar complained to President Karzai, the court dropped the charge on 
June 24, saying that it was not supported by sufficient evidence. But a deputy 
chief justice, Fazel Ahmad Manawi, was quoted by the BBC as saying, &quot;Maybe, 
if we get stronger evidence, we will reopen the case.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The use of a blasphemy charge against Samar - even if it was later dropped 
- is a troubling sign that the judiciary in Afghanistan might become an instrument 
of political repression,&quot; said Jefferson. &quot;The charge can be reinstated, 
against Dr. Samar or anyone else, and be used to silence and intimidate. The government 
needs to explain how all of this happened, why it happened, and why it won't happen 
again.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch said the blasphemy charge is connected to reports of threats 
during the loya jirga. During the loya jirga, Human Rights Watch documented how 
Dr. Samar and several other female delegates were targeted for intimidation on 
numerous occasions. The blasphemy allegation was repeatedly highlighted by warlords 
threatening Dr. Samar. Delegates aligned with the Jamiat-i Islami party, and other 
groups aligned with the former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, demanded that she 
&quot;repent&quot; for comments in the paper. Chief Justice Shinwari was widely 
reported in Afghan media as saying that Dr. Samar had made &quot;irresponsible 
statements&quot; and that the Supreme Court of Afghanistan believes that she cannot 
hold an official position in government. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch said that the intimidation and threats had helped to marginalize 
Dr. Samar during and after the loya jirga. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch also called on President Karzai to carry through on his 
promise to investigate all cases of intimidation during the loya jirga, and to 
ensure the security of those who report such abuses. </font></p>
