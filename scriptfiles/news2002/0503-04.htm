- May 3 - The U.S. Government has reversed a decision to allow the release of more than $40 million worth of illegal mahogany earmarked for U.S. furniture companies following pressure from Greenpeace and top authorities in the Brazilian government. Greenpeace discovered earlier this week that the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Fish and Wildlife had approved the release of the mahogany based on an April 25 document from the Brazilian government deeming the timber legal. The international environmental group immediately sent evidence of the timber's illegal status to White House officials and showed the release document from IBAMA to top officials in Brazil. The Minister of Environment in Brazil and other top officials then rescinded the release document, dismissed the official who wrote it and made emergency calls to the White House. In light of those frantic calls, the USDA announced late last night that it would not release the timber. The timber remains impounded at 15 U.S. ports. The White House is investigating whether any timber actually left the 15 ports yesterday. 

<p>

"The fact that this illegal timber trade is destroying the Amazon is enough evidence that the U.S. needs to return the mahogany and begin investigating the companies buying it," said Scott Paul, Greenpeace forests campaigner. 

<p>

When President Bush announced in February 2002 that he was calling on the Secretary of State to begin an initiative to combat illegal logging, Greenpeace met with top advisors and provided evidence of U.S. links to illegal logging in endangered forests. 

<p>

In October 2001, Greenpeace released a report, titled "<a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/forests/mahogany.pdf" target="_new">Partners in Mahogany Crime</a> (pdf)," that exposed rampant illegalities and corruption in the Brazilian mahogany trade. The report also linked companies such as Aljoma, Ethan Allen and Stickley to this illegal trade. Based on Greenpeace's investigation, the Brazilian government halted all mahogany trade. In spite of this moratorium, several powerful exporters took legal action and continued to ship mahogany. Despite the ban, some companies have managed to continue exporting to the United States and other countries. As reported in the Wall Street Journal on March 29, 2002, Greenpeace's on-going investigation revealed that at least  $10 million worth of shipments arrived in U.S. ports following Brazil's ban. That figure has now escalated to estimates of more than $40 million.

<p>

"President Bush has made illegal logging a priority, but the U.S. continues to be the biggest importer of illegal wood," added Paul. "Talk won't save the Amazon from illegal logging. Only tough U.S. laws and tough enforcement will ensure that U.S. consumers are not unknowingly fueling this crime."<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
