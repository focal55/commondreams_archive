David Potorti, who lost his brother James at the World Trade Center, said today: 

"Victims of terrorism and war -- from Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian 

territories, the Philippines and Japan -- will join family members of Sept. 11 

victims for a joint speaking tour in the days immediately before and after Sept. 

11, 2002. The 'No More Victims' tour, co-sponsored by September Eleventh Families 

for Peaceful Tomorrows and the American Friends Service Committee, hopes to place 

the human dimension of the 9-11 attacks and of war at the center of the national 

debate over the 'war against terrorism'.... By putting a human face on the casualties 

of terrorism and war, we hope to demonstrate the price of responding to violence 

with violence. The true cost of the U.S. war on terror, in human terms, is reflected 

in the experiences of these people, leading them to seek alternatives." Peaceful 

Tomorrows members available for interviews include Talat Hamdani, a Pakistani-American 

woman who endured rumors that her son was a terrorist after he disappeared on 

Sept. 11. His remains were later found at the World Trade Center site, where it 

is thought he rushed to try to save people with his skills as a trained emergency 

technician. [Joseph Gerson is director of programs at the AFSC in New England.

A founder of United for Peace, a coalition of groups, Benjamin said today: "In 

over 100 U.S. cities, as well as nearly a dozen foreign countries, people are 

honoring those who died on Sept. 11 by calling for no more innocent victims."</p>

Kelly is coordinator of Voices in the Wilderness, a humanitarian relief group. 

She and other members of the group have been on a 40-day fast at the UN headquarters 

in Manhattan, calling for a nonviolent foreign policy. They will break their fast 

on Sept. 10 at 11 a.m. with symbolic servings of embargoed Iraqi dates. The group 

has openly violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by taking medicine there without 

U.S. government approval. Two participants in the fast, Henry Williamson (from 

Charleston, S.C.) and Cynthia Banas (from Verona, N.Y.), are then planning to 

go to Iraq; they intend to stay through any massive U.S. assault on Iraq.</p>
