- July 1 - The Sierra Club today expressed deep concern that the Bush Administration's 
plan to slash the Superfund cleanup program could leave dozens of communities 
exposed to dangerous toxic waste, and allow the polluters off the hook. In addition 
to eliminating cleanup funding completely at 33 sites, as reported in today's 
New York Times, the Bush Administration is reducing funding at another 15 sites, 
which will slow the pace of cleanup there. The lists of sites appear at the end 
of this release.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Superfund cleanups 
are already running on fumes and if the Bush administration has its way, the program 
will be completely out of gas,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the 
Sierra Club. &quot;The Administration should be demanding that the polluters who 
made these messes pay for cleanup, but instead they're slowing down or stopping 
cleanups. The Bush administration is telling communities that have waited for 
years to get rid of toxic chemicals in their water and soil that they'll just 
have to wait some more.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More than 1,200 toxic sites that have not yet been cleaned up remain on the 
EPA's National Priority List of sites, and according to a study Congress commissioned 
from Resources for the Future, an estimated 23 to 49 new toxic sites could be 
added to the list each year.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original 'polluter pays' funding mechanism that Congress enacted to pay 
for the Superfund program expired in 1995. The money accumulated in the Superfund 
Trust Fund has diminished greatly since then, and Superfund is expected to run 
out of money by 2004. As a result, individual taxpayers have been picking up more 
of the costs of the program. In 1995 taxpayers paid about 18 percent of program 
costs; in 2003 they will pay 54 percent of the costs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The pace of completed cleanups has slowed dramatically in recent years. The 
EPA completed construction on only 47 sites in 2001, less than the 75 it had projected 
and far less than the 87 achieved in 2000. The rate of cleanups will continue 
to decline in the future unless Congress acts to increase funding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This cleanup slowdown comes just as the Superfund funding should be reaching 
its peak, according to projections made in a 2001 report requested by Congress. 
That report, conducted under EPA contract by Resources for the Future, estimates 
that funding needs for FY 2000 through FY 2009 could range from $15.6 billion 
to $18.3 billion.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'polluter pays' mechanism, which expired in 1995, was supported by every 
President since it's inception, including President George H.W. Bush. But now, 
President George W. Bush opposes funding mechanism. The Sierra Club supports legislation 
in the House and Senate that would reinstate the polluter pays program.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We applaud those members of Congress, including Senators Barbara Boxer 
and Lincoln Chafee and Representative Frank Pallone, who have introduced legislation 
to reinstate the same 'polluter pays' funding program that Congress authorized 
in 1986,&quot; said Pope. &quot;We urge Congress to pass this legislation to help 
communities who have been living too long with toxic waste.&quot;</font></p>
