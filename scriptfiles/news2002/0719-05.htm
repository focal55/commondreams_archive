<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- July 19 - The White House has approved the release of records of former President 
Ronald Reagan and former Vice President George H.W. Bush &#8212; records that 
were required by law to be released more than a year ago. The delay in releasing 
the records, as well as an unlawful executive order that purports to authorize 
the delay, was challenged by Public Citizen and a coalition of other groups in 
federal district court here. The Justice Department notified the Public Citizen 
Litigation Group of the White House&#8217;s decision in a letter today. Although 
the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/litigation/briefs/FOIAGovtSec/PresRecords/articles.cfm?ID=6515" target="_new">lawsuit</a> 
spurred the release, other documents, including about 1,600 pages about which 
former President Reagan's representatives have expressed unknown &quot;concerns,&quot; 
remain under wraps.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The records to be released include approximately 150 pages of Reagan documents, 
the last of a group of about 68,000 pages of records that were supposed to be 
released in January 2001 under the Presidential Records Act, which governs access 
to records of former presidents and vice presidents. Most of the 150 pages, which 
the lawsuit&#8217;s plaintiffs have not yet seen, are believed to consist of memoranda 
concerning Supreme Court appointments and other presidential appointments to federal 
office.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush White House blocked release of the Reagan records in early 2001 and 
then issued an executive order in November 2001 that claimed to give former presidents 
and vice presidents, as well as the incumbent president, the power to veto the 
release of records by claiming &quot;executive privilege.&quot; After Public Citizen 
and a coalition of historians and journalists filed a lawsuit in December challenging 
the executive order, the White House approved release of most of the 68,000 pages 
of Reagan records in March, but 150 pages that were considered especially sensitive 
were held back for further review, which resulted in another four months of delay 
in their release.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The disclosure that the White House has finally decided to release these 
documents is a clear indication that they realize they can&#8217;t make a claim 
of &#8216;executive privilege&#8217; stick so many years after President Reagan 
left office,&quot; said Public Citizen attorney Scott L. Nelson. &quot;And with 
the pressure of a lawsuit, they also knew they couldn&#8217;t keep stalling indefinitely 
on the pretext that they were still &#8216;reviewing&#8217; the documents.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nelson added that he expects the government now to argue that the lawsuit should 
be dismissed because the Reagan documents will soon be released. &quot;The White 
House desperately wants to avoid having a court decide whether its executive order 
is lawful, so it has made every effort to dodge the issue,&quot; he said. &quot;But 
the government is continuing to implement the executive order and is using it 
to hold up release of other documents, so the legal challenge to the order remains 
a live issue.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In particular, Public Citizen has recently learned that there are another 1,654 
pages of Reagan records, whose existence was not previously disclosed by the National 
Archives, that were supposed to be released in January 2001. But the Archives, 
apparently in deference to &quot;concerns&quot; expressed about the documents 
by Reagan&#8217;s representatives, did not include them with the 68,000 pages 
that initially gave rise to the executive order and the litigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only after Public Citizen raised questions about the handling of the additional 
1,654 pages did the Archives belatedly notify the White House and Reagan in June 
that it intended to release them. The release of those documents, the contents 
of which are completely unknown, is currently being held up pending review by 
the former president&#8217;s staff and the White House under the executive order.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The White House decision today also authorizes the release of about 40 pages 
of records of former Vice President Bush. Those pages, which were not part of 
the 68,000 pages of Reagan records, were among 884 pages of Bush vice presidential 
documents that were supposed to be released under the Presidential Records Act 
in January 2001. They, too, were held back until Public Citizen raised questions 
about their status. In June, 844 pages were released, but 40 pages remained under 
review pursuant to the executive order. Like the 150 pages of Reagan documents 
whose release has just been authorized, the 40 pages of Bush documents are said 
by the Archives to relate to appointments to federal office. So in all, the government 
plans to release 190 pages.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Prying these documents loose has been like pulling teeth,&quot; said 
Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook. &quot;We intend to keep fighting to overturn 
President Bush&#8217;s illegal executive order on presidential records so that 
the unimpeded public access that the Presidential Records Act was designed to 
bring about is a reality.&quot;
