Twenty-first Century<br>

The Rainbow Ark Foundation ,the creators and producers of the Global Wisdom Council 

Trek have been invited to collaborate with the 2002 International Trek of the 

Tall Ships, in order to begin to create a highly visible, global ambassadorial 

journey of televised Global Wisdom Councils. The Trek began in May of this year 

in Okinawa, Japan and proceeded to Korea, then on to Vancouver, BC; Seattle, San 

Francisco, Los Angeles, culminating its journey in San Diego on September 11,2002. 

The Global Wisdom Council will convene for a council at sea, on the Europa (the 

symbolic Rainbow Ark) as she ports in Los Angeles, September 9th with the tall 

ships. This council will be focused on the theme of September 11th, One Year Later.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just as The Rainbow Ark 

Foundation's October 11, 2001, New York Global Wisdom Council on board the Europa, 

then ported in Manhattan, focused on the issue of the media's responsibility in 

creating a culture of peace, the Global Wisdom Council will continue to gather 

peacemakers, and media makers as well as wise visionaries from around the world 

to contemplate the following questions:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What values do we bring 

on board the Ark for the Twenty-first Century in order to build a sustainable 

world that supports everyone? </font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What values do we let go 

of? </font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What is our responsibility 

in healing our own duality of the us against them beliefs that still predominates 

our way of being in the world ? </font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Can we finally heal our 

ancient collective broken heart? </font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What is the media's (our 

collective voice) responsibility in creating a culture of peace?</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Global Wisdom Council Trek:<br>

The Rainbow Ark's Global Wisdom Council intends to continue on to Europe in 2003 

- England, the Netherlands, and beyond, continuing to facilitate and televise 

Global Wisdom Councils. This working council will not only reveal and share solutions, 

but will help implement these solutions through it's growing grassroots global 

networks. In this way Global Wisdom Council will help shift the power of television 

to a higher octave...to educate, uplift, heal and share our collective wisdom 

and resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This voyaging Global Wisdom 

Council is designed to galvanize eco-spiritually based citizens to build links 

and bridges between people and organizations that are already working to create 

a better world, so that we can synergize a greater global collaborative effort 

in helping to create a culture of lasting peace - and healing of the Earth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background on The Global 

Wisdom Council:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creating inner and outer 

peace;<br>

The Rainbow Ark Foundation's first Global Wisdom Council was held in the summer 

of 1998 at Zaca Lake, CA. Peter Russell, author of The Global Brain, Mark Dubois, 

co-producer of the International Earth Day Events, David Dellinger, one of the 

original Chicago Seven and dear friend of Martin Luther King, Lavina White, Haider 

elder from the Queen Charlotte Islands were some of the many visionaries in attendance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These cross cultural, cross 

disciplinary, cross generational global Councils are meant to create the space 

not only to acknowledge our differences, but to learn how to respect them in new 

and creative ways that will inspire transformative action, helping to heal the 

fragmentation of our cultures, our generations, and our relationship to the Earth 

and ourselves. This work is a seed that is intended to help rebuild community 

in the world; a new global community that seeks unity while honoring diversity. 

This council seeks to answer the current state of the world challenges from the 

inner wisdom of the heart.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result of the events 

of September 11, 2001, we took the Rainbow Ark Foundation's vision to the next 

level by creating the beginnings of a voyaging Global Wisdom Council on board 

an Ark for the 21st century. This tangible symbol of global steward-ship and global- 

citizen-ship brings together those already working for peace, ecology and human 

rights to focus on the creation of a greater collaborative force for positive 

change.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On October 11, 2001, in 

New York City, The Rainbow Ark Foundation hosted a Global Wisdom Council on board 

one of the great tall ships of the world, the Europa of the Netherlands. This 

event was co-produced with The Lifebridge Foundation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On board, people actively 

working for peace met in council with media makers to spend an entire day together 

to begin to understand, and possibly heal, our us against them, victim vs. enemy, 

beliefs which dominate our way of being in the world. We discussed the recent 

example of our collective trauma that occurred in Manhattan, exactly a month earlier, 

with the intention going to a deeper level of healing within ourselves our piece 

of the collective broken heartedness.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the goals of the 

Rainbow Ark' Global Wisdom Council is to influence media makers to pick up the 

&quot;torch of peacemaking&quot; through making commitments to creating theater, 

film, television, journalism and personal statements that will reach and affect 

their audiences. A key objective of the New York council was to engage invited 

media makers in a deeper conversation regarding their role as story tellers, in 

creating peace.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This council was so powerfully 

impacting that attending council elder and filmmaker, Andre Gregory (My Dinner 

with Andre) imparted the following to all of us that evening, &quot;I will try 

to heal the disease that's within me, the disease of indifference&#352;so that 

I take responsibility to doing something in this world that will relieve the pain 

of this world so we wouldn't continue to be where we are today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other attending council 

elders committed to join the next steps of the Rainbow Ark Foundation, the Global 

Wisdom Council trek. One was Paul MacIssac, award winning filmmaker, journalist 

and current artistic director of the Play Back Theatre,NYC (an international theater 

troupe that uses improvisational theater to make socio-political statements) will 

bring the power of his troupe to the council experience.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Others that have joined 

the Crew include renowned ecologist and representative for the environment at 

the recent opening of the 2002 Olympics at Salt Lake City, Jean&shy;Michel Costeau. 

Seeing the importance of this kind of global synergy, Mr. Costeau made a commitment 

to help connect the Rainbow Ark internationally to sympathetic groups and individuals..</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These Councils in New York 

and now, in Los Angeles on September 9th, mark the beginning of a series of Global 

Wisdom Councils that will draw together some of the world's greatest visionaries 

from the media and theater arts as well as peace, environmental, social justice 

and spiritual initiatives. These councils will create a visible, global chorus 

of Wisdom Elders (elderhood not necessarily meaning old age but a sacred way of 

being in the world, whether 18 or 80) to help heal our wounded world, as well 

as navigate our newly emerging compassionate world society, at its chaotic beginning 

of the twenty-first century. A contemplative chorus that will hold a higher divine 

directive, helping to create a culture based on spiritual values.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As, Peter Russell (author 

of The Global Brain) and council elder from England attested about the importance 

of these councils is - &quot; This deep sharing from the heart is what our society 

needs so desperately. We need to develop kindness, caring and compassion for each 

other. This is how the &quot;magic&quot; happens and the needed changes in the 

world take place.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This visible chorus will 

carry the voice of another conversation, currently unrecognized by our corporate 

media, that speaks of a desire for a new moral code that's beyond the &quot;eye 

for an eye.&quot; This chorus speaks of tolerance and compassion as Gandhi taught 

us: &quot;a willingness to hear the other side.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rainbow Ark's Global 

Wisdom Council Trek's long-term vision is an on-going international television 

program oriented towards the interconnectedness and reverence for all life. This 

program will address issues holistically to help us remember and understand that 

our thoughts and actions always affect others as well as the Earth. Through a 

series of televised councils, this program will create a global echo that spreads 

like ripples on a pond from a pebble whose lasting effects will return the power 

to where it belongs; back to the global citizens of the Earth&#352;as well as 

the responsibility for ourselves and the Earth</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These Global Wisdom Council 

treks are being established to fulfill the mission of the Rainbow Ark Foundation: 

To help create a culture of peace through the fundamental teaching of Sacred Ecology. 

Sacred Ecology is based on the axiom that all life is an expression of soul and 

spirit. It has a deep reverence for life and an understanding that there is no 

separation betw een humans and other living things including the Earth. It asserts 

that the recognition of this fact leads us to re-embrace and honor our inherent 

unity while celebrating our diversity. In practicing Sacred Ecology, we seek to 

reawaken our sense of the interconnectedness of life from which true respect and 

honoring of all life can exist for all beings of the Earth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rainbow Ark's Foundation 

thanks you for your consideration in participating in this sacred work. We would 

love for you to be part of the crew.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With great love, </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Global Wisdom Council 

will convene on the Europa, at the port of Los Angeles at San Pedro on Monday 

September 9th at 1pm until 8pm for a Council at sea, Fred Stern, the Rainbow Maker 

will put a giant rainbow over the port of LA at 5pm, followed by a dinner reception.</font></p>
