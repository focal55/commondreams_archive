<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - July 1 - Jews 
for Peace in Palestine and Israel (JPPI) officially launched today its Congressional 
Report Card for the 107th Congress. The report card can be viewed at: <a href="http://www.jppi.org/congress_reportcard.html" target="_new">http://www.jppi.org/congress_reportcard.html</a>. 
Members of Congress were graded on their voting patterns and their sponsorship 
of major bills and resolutions introduced in the 107th Congress which pertain 
to the Israel-Palestine conflict.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of Congress received a negative mark each time they voted for or sponsored 
a bill or resolution which is unbalanced. These typically place all of the blame 
for the violence on the Palestinians and sanction them while absolving Israel 
of any responsibility or wrongdoing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of Congress received a positive mark each time they voted against or 
abstained from voting for a bill or resolution which is unbalanced. In addition, 
they received a positive mark for sponsoring a bill or resolution which is balanced. 
These typically acknowledge that both Israelis and Palestinians have engaged in 
acts of violence and that both sides must make an effort to return to the negotiating 
table and find a solution to the conflict based on UN resolutions in order to 
prevent further bloodshed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Report Card found that two Senators&#8212;Robert Byrd (D-WV) and Ernest 
Hollings (D-SC)&#8212;had a perfect &quot;pro-just peace&quot; score (+1). Three 
Representatives&#8212;John Dingell (D-MI), Cynthia McKinney (D-GA) and Nick Rahall 
(R-WV)&#8212;received perfect &quot;pro-just peace&quot; scores (+6) in the House. 
Seven Senators and 24 Representatives received the worst possible &quot;pro-occupation&quot; 
score (+5 and +6 respectively).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Josh Ruebner, co-founder of JPPI, the report card &quot;demonstrates 
conclusively that Congress is playing a biased role in the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. By overwhelmingly backing resolutions that portray Israeli aggression 
against the Palestinian people as acts of legitimate self-defense, Congress is 
giving Israel encouragement to continue its senseless policy of militarily occupying 
Palestine.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leah Harris, a board member of JPPI, said that the United States &quot;cannot 
be an &#8216;honest broker&#8217; as it claims to be if it continues to make all 
progress toward peace contingent upon Palestinian action while rewarding Israel 
for exceeding the bounds of legitimate self-defense. As American Jews who support 
a just peace, we hope that Congress will take into account the needs and aspirations 
of both peoples.&quot; </font></p>
