- June 10 - News Advisory:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHO: This week ActionAid releases a policy brief based on a



recently completed substantive independent report that traces the



policy cycle and political economy that led to the recent food



related disaster in Malawi. The policy brief isolates policy



elements that show aid conditionalities and bad directives from the



IMF to the government of Malawi played a role in famine and death

at the beginning of this year.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: "The food crisis in Malawi in early 2002 resulted in

several hundred hunger-related deaths -- perhaps several thousand.

These deaths make this the worst famine in living memory, certainly

worse than the drought of 1991/92, and worse even than the

Nyasaland famine of 1949." Quotation from the report.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHEN: 1:30 p.m., Thursday, June 13

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHERE: National Press Club, The Murrow Room, 14th and F Streets,

NW, Washington, D.C.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHY: Understanding of the process and conditions that led to

the deaths of up to 1,000 men, women and children in Malawi this

year has been clouded by the public trading of blame by the

Government of Malawi and the International Monetary Fund. In the

United States, recent USAID statements have further complicated

understanding that there has not yet been a famine. The USAID

Administrator is scheduled to testify to Congress on Thursday

morning on this very issue.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This independent report and brief by one of the largest

development, relief and rights NGO in Malawi is the first

independent NGO assessments of the famine. The report persuasively

argues that the famine was caused by negative synergies between

government and donor policies and practices. It outlines the

following AND MORE:

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- The IMF instructed the Government of Malawi to sell the

Strategic Grain Reserve, to repay a debt of MK1 billion incurred by

the National Food Reserve Agency when it was set up as a

quasi-independent agency.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Private traders profiteered from the sale of the grain

reserve, buying maize cheaply and hoarding it until prices rose

before reselling it for exorbitant profits.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Donor-government relations were strained at the crucial time,

because of allegations by the donors of economic mismanagement and

governance failures. The donors delayed responding to the food

crisis because they were obsessed with finding out what had

happened to the Strategic Grain Reserve.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The release of the Policy Brief and Report in Washington occurs

during the week that hundreds gather in Rome for the World Food

Summit and one month from an IMF Board meeting to receive staff

reports on the situation in Malawi.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For further information on the press conference contact Denise

Hughes at 202-321-8923.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>ActionAid believes that poor people's right to food in 2002 is

directly threatened by global trade agreements that are dominated

by rich nations and profit-driven multinationals. International

corporations and institutions such as the World Trade Organisation,

IMF and World Bank have a huge impact on poor people's daily lives.

ActionAid works to influence these institutions and national

governments in thirty countries where it works, including Malawi

and an international level.</i></font></p>
