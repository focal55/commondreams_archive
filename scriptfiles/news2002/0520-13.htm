- May 20 - According to a draft 

Federal Register notice obtained by World Wildlife Fund, the U.S. 

Department of the Interior will open an estimated 800,000 acres of 

public forestland to prospecting and new mining claims. The action 

reduces by more than 90 percent the area protected by a moratorium 

on new mining claims in the Siskiyou National Forest and 150,000 

acres of adjacent BLM lands known as the Siskiyou Wild Rivers area. 

Copies of the draft notice can be obtained through WWF. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In January 2001, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt issued a 

two-year moratorium on new mining claims in the area so scientists 

could study impacts from mining and to give the public an 

opportunity to provide comments. Since then, more than 23,469 

public comments, an overwhelming majority of the comments received, 

have supported increased protection for the Siskiyou Mountains. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The draft notice says the action will be taken &quot;to protect the 

nationally significant ecological and biological values of the 

Siskiyou Wild Rivers area.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Protecting the Siskiyou Wild Rivers area by opening it up to 

mining makes no sense,&quot; said Dr. Dominick DellaSala, director of 

WWF's Klamath/Siskiyou program. &quot;This action reopens the area's 

salmon streams and forests to mining operations even though mining 

in this forest provides virtually no employment and contributes 

nothing to the local economy. It's mining for fun with bulldozers 

and suction dredges.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Secretary Norton's action would ignore the thousands of people 

who commented favorably on the moratorium,&quot; said Steve Marsden, 

executive director of the Siskiyou Project, &quot;and effectively kills 

the only avenue local people, scientists, and the rest of the 

American public had to voice how they thought this public land 

should be managed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The area withdrawn from the moratorium contains some of the most 

biologically diverse terrain in the West and some of the best 

salmon streams in the lower 48 states. It contains more untamed 

rivers than anywhere else in the Lower 48 and contains the largest 

block of unprotected roadless areas along the Pacific Coast from 

the Olympic Mountains to the Baja Peninsula. It is also home to 

the greatest concentration of rare plants of any national forest. </font></p>
