<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- May 15 - It takes a lot of pride in oneself -- and guts, too -- to run 

for office. Even more so if you're lesbian, gay, bisexual or 

transgendered. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elaine Noble was the first in the country to campaign and win as 

an out candidate, and a handful of men and women quickly followed 

her. But TIME Magazine in its &quot;Most Influential People of the 20th 

Century&quot; project perpetuated the myth that Harvey Milk was the 

first gay person to be &quot;elected to any substantial political office 

in the history of the planet.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Exhibit creator R.S. Lee is working to rectify that myth and 

others in a 60-piece photo and text exhibit called &quot;Out &amp; Elected 

in the U.S.A.&quot; The exhibit is traveling the country and is making 

a stop in Washington, D.C., to coincide with the city's annual 

Capital Pride festivities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Lee, Milk was elected to San Francisco's board of 

supervisors in 1977 -- five years after Noble fought off vicious 

anti-gay attacks to win election to the Massachusetts State House 

-- but perhaps the reason that Milk is erroneously credited as the 

first gay officeholder is his 1978 assassination, which made 

international headlines. Lee personally interviewed Noble, as well 

as brave men and women from 30 different states, all of whom have 

held themselves up to public scrutiny and have won elective 

offices, whether local party posts or seats in Congress. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This last 25 years is really important because it was the first 

wave of openly gay and lesbian people in public office,&quot; said Mike 

Nelson, who is the openly gay mayor of Carrboro, N.C., and whose 

story is included in the exhibit. &quot;(R.S. Lee) has done a service 

to not just the lesbian and gay community, but the American 

community in general. It's not unlike the first wave of African 

Americans being elected to office.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The national tour of &quot;Out &amp; Elected in the U.S.A.&quot; is sponsored 

by the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Foundation. Its showing in D.C. would 

not be possible without the support of Councilmembers Jim Graham 

and David Catania. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WHAT: <br>

The Washington, D.C., opening of R.S. Lee's acclaimed photo and 

text exhibit on gay elected officials entitled, &quot;Out &amp; Elected in
