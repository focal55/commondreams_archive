- July 2 - The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen today released new information 
about 1,111 physicians who have been disciplined by Texas&#8217;s state medical 
board and other agencies for incompetence, misprescribing drugs, sexual misconduct, 
criminal convictions, ethical lapses and other offenses. Most of the doctors were 
not required to stop practicing, even temporarily.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen has been publishing national and regional editions of its Questionable 
Doctors database in book form for more than a decade. But now, for the first time, 
the database is available on the World Wide Web. The Questionable Doctors Online 
web site is <a href="http://www.questionabledoctors.org/" target="_new">www.questionabledoctors.org</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consumers will be able to search the list of disciplined doctors for free. 
For $10, they can view and print detailed disciplinary reports on up to 10 individual 
doctors over a three-month period in any state listed. The web site contains information 
about doctors in California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Vermont. More states will 
be added throughout the year.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen criticized the Texas Board of Medical Examiners&#8217; poor 
record of disciplining Texas doctors. Examples of doctors who were disciplined 
but are currently allowed to continue practicing in Texas include:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A doctor who admitted to and was convicted for four drive-by shootings of 
garages and automobiles belonging to a former business partner; </font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A doctor who was arrested and pleaded guilty on charges stemming from writing 
prescriptions in exchange for sexual favors; </font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A doctor whose surgical outpatient died after he administered an overdose 
of Ketalar and Valium, placing her under general anesthesia rather than the conscious 
sedation he intended; </font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A doctor who settled a lawsuit alleging he fused the wrong level of a patient&#8217;s 
neck; and, </font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A doctor who had sexual relations with four patients and admitted to a history 
of alcoholism.</font>
</ul>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For many of the offenses committed by Texas doctors, the disciplinary actions 
have been dangerously lenient,&quot; said Sidney Wolfe, M.D., director of Public 
Citizen&#8217;s Health Research Group. &quot;The majority of Texas doctors who 
committed the five most serious offenses weren&#8217;t required to stop practicing, 
even temporarily. Therefore, it is likely that they are still practicing in Texas 
and that their patients are not aware of their offenses.&quot;</li>

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the 10-year period covered by the Questionable Doctors Online database, 
there were a total of 2,106 disciplinary actions issued against 1,111 doctors 
in Texas. For the five most serious offenses, there were: 106 actions taken against 
doctors because of criminal convictions; 220 for substandard care, incompetence 
or negligence; 190 for misprescribing or overprescribing drugs; 290 for substance 
abuse; and 95 for sexual abuse of or sexual misconduct with a patient.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the 220 actions taken against doctors for substandard care, incompetence 
or negligence, only six (3 percent) involved revocation or suspension. Similarly, 
of the 95 actions taken for sexual abuse of or sexual misconduct with a patient, 
only 14 (15 percent) involved suspension or revocation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;All too often, state medical boards are more concerned about protecting 
the reputations of doctors than doing their job, which is to protect unsuspecting 
patients from doctors who may be incompetent or negligent,&quot; Wolfe said. &quot;Texas 
has an appalling record of letting serious and sometimes repeat offenders off 
the hook.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen also has published a ranking of state medical boards, based 
on the number of serious disciplinary actions (license revocations, surrenders, 
suspensions and probation/restrictions) per 1,000 doctors in each state. In 2001, 
nationally there were 3.36 serious actions taken for every 1,000 physicians. Texas 
ranked No. 30 (tied with New Mexico and North Carolina) on the list, with 122 
serious sanctions levied against 47,994 doctors, for a rate of 2.54 per 1,000 
doctors. (To view the ranking, <a href="http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7166" target="_new">click 
here</a>.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For each of the past six years (1996-2001) Texas has ranked in the bottom half 
of states in the rate of serious disciplinary actions per 1,000 doctors, never 
higher than 28/29 and as low as 38. In 2001, there were 10 states that disciplined 
more than twice as many doctors per 1,000 doctors in those states than Texas did, 
including Arizona, Oklahoma, Ohio and Kentucky. If Texas had done as well as any 
of these 10 states, there would have been an additional 122 physicians subjected 
to serious disciplinary actions last year.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Nationwide, an extremely tiny fraction of doctors face disciplinary action,&quot; 
Wolfe said. &quot;And Texas is well below the national average. The state needs 
to start doing a better job of protecting the public.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wolfe also criticized the Texas Board of Medical Examiners for the lack of 
information about physician offenses that is posted on the board&#8217;s web site. 
&quot;The board&#8217;s web site is woefully uninformative,&quot; Wolfe said. 
&quot;Most of the time, there is little or no information about the doctor&#8217;s 
offense, only vague references to the offenses such as &#8216;unprofessional&#8217; 
or &#8216;dishonorable&#8217; conduct. This is unacceptable, because patients 
need to be able to make informed decisions about which doctor they choose to see.&quot;</font></p>

here</a>. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen recommends that states promptly make public all of their board 
disciplinary actions, malpractice payouts and hospital disciplinary actions; strengthen 
medical practice statutes; restructure their medical boards to sever any links 
with state medical societies; and increase funding and staffing for medical boards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen has long sought greater consumer access to information about 
doctors, and there have been recent improvements in making that information available. 
Most state medical boards now provide some physician information on the Internet, 
but the information about disciplinary actions varies greatly, is often inadequate 
and can be difficult for people to access.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information about doctor discipline, including state sanctions, hospital disciplinary 
actions and medical malpractice awards is now contained in the National Practitioner 
Data Bank, but that database is kept secret from the public.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;HMOs, hospitals and medical boards can look at the National Practitioner 
Data Bank, but consumers cannot,&quot; Wolfe said. &quot;It is time we lifted 
the veil of secrecy surrounding doctors and allowed the people who have the most 
to lose from questionable doctors to get the information they need to protect 
themselves and their families. But until Congress finds the will to open up this 
information, Public Citizen will provide the public with as much of the data as 
we can obtain.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the addition of Texas, Questionable Doctors Online now lists doctors disciplined 
in 13 states from 1992 through 2001. Information comes from all 50 state medical 
boards, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 
the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration. Previously 
listed physicians sanctioned in 1990 and 1991 were removed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using the information from the state and federal agencies, Public Citizen created 
a database containing the doctor&#8217;s name, degree, license number, date of 
birth, location, the disciplinary state or agency, the date of the disciplinary 
action, the nature of the discipline and available information about the case. 
Public Citizen asked all the state medical boards to provide information about 
court actions that may have overruled or changed previous disciplinary actions. 
Any disciplinary actions that were overturned by courts or for which litigation 
ended in the doctor&#8217;s favor were deleted from the database.
