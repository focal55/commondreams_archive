Past president of the American Public Health Association,

author of the recent article "Bioterrorism Preparedness: Cooptation of

Public Health?" and co-editor of <i>War and Public Health</i> and the

forthcoming <i>Terrorism and Public Health</i>, Sidel said today: "The

bill adopted Thursday by the Senate is likely to divert funds from essential

public health services. At a time when public health programs in the U.S. are

being sharply reduced in many states, this bill will divert $4.6 billion to

preparation for unsubstantiated threats. The U.S. would be better protected if

it worked to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits use

of biological weapons, rather than obstructing such efforts."

President of the National Center for Policy Research for

Women and Families, Zuckerman said today: "The bioterrorism bill contains

provisions that affect the FDA's review of all new prescription drugs (which of

course have nothing to do with bioterrorism). They were negotiated during

secret meetings between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry. The industry

got what it wanted -- an even faster drug approval process. Advocates for

consumers and patients were totally excluded from the meetings. Several members

of Congress added some safeguards for patients, but the law is still designed

primarily to benefit industry, not consumers. This affects all of us. For

example, more and more of us are taking medications for chronic health

conditions -- weight control, high cholesterol, diabetes, depression -- but

these medications have never been proven safe over the long term. The Enron

scandal should have taught us that we need strong safeguards so that watchdogs

like the FDA make sure that companies do the right thing.... If a company

making medical products puts profits before consumers, people lose their

lives."

href="http://www.umich.edu/~spwright" target="_new">www.umich.edu/~spwright</a><BR>

Coauthor of <i>Preventing a Biological Arms Race</i> and the

forthcoming <i>Biological Warfare and Disarmament: Global Perspectives</i>,

Wright said today: "What Congress is seeking in this bill is a technical

fix for the bioterrorism problem. And while it is reasonable to take

precautionary measures, there should be no illusion that these can solve the

problem in the long term, regardless of how much the U.S. is willing to spend.

In the long run, the only solutions to the bioterrorism problem are political

solutions. The problem of bioterrorism is intertwined with fundamental

geopolitical problems, especially in the Middle East, where biological weaponry

takes on its most intractable form. The stubborn fact is that as long as

nuclear weapons are present in Israel, other states will be tempted to develop

chemical and biological capacities... This in turn encourages dissemination of

expertise in the region.... Clearly a second major challenge is to find a

solution to the ongoing stand-off between Iraq and the UN Security Council over

inspection of Iraq's biological and chemical programs... Finally, it is

essential that all of the parties to the Biological Weapons Convention work to

strengthen this treaty. Unfortunately, the U.S. government is doing exactly the

opposite -- both by rejecting multilateral approaches to disarmament and by

pursuing biological defense projects that can be seen as treaty

violations."
