<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Settlement Includes:<br>

* Ban on Growing European and Genetically Modified Salmon Strains<br>

* Agreement to Operate So That Fish Do Not Escape, and to Comply With Federal Fish-Marking Requirements<br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PORTLAND, ME - June 4 - The U.S.  Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG) announced today that it has achieved a settlement of its lawsuit charging Heritage Salmon, Inc. with violating the federal Clean Water Act.  In a detailed Consent Decree submitted for approval to Judge Gene Carter of the U.S. District Court in Portland, Heritage is committing to precedent-setting salmon farm practices designed to reduce the impact of its operations on the nearly extinct wild Atlantic salmon and on water quality.

</font>

<p>	<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;U.S. PIRG sued the three biggest corporate fish farms in Maine to address the international scandal of salmon farm pollution,&quot; said U.S. PIRG's Maine Campaign Director Shana Starobin.  &quot;With this settlement, Heritage becomes the industry leader in pollution reduction.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> U.S. PIRG sued Heritage, Stolt Sea Farm and Atlantic Salmon of Maine in July 2000 for illegally discharging pollutants into the ocean without a Clean Water Act discharge permit.  The Stolt and Atlantic Salmon of Maine cases are still pending.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heritage operates salmon farms in Cobscook Bay, which is at the easternmost tip of Maine.  It is a subsidiary of George Weston, Ltd., a Canadian food conglomerate that makes Thomas' English muffins, Girl Scout Cookies and Entenmann's baked goods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This agreement sets a new standard for environmental regulation of salmon aquaculture,&quot; Starobin said.  The settlement requires Heritage to comply with a host of operational conditions designed to reduce the environmental impact of its salmon farms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Consent Decree:<br>

* Heritage will not grow European salmon.  Escaping European fish can cross-breed with wild North American salmon; their less fit offspring could hasten the demise of the wild salmon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will not grow genetically modified salmon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will take strong measures to prevent fish escapes.   Heritage

must employ fully functional marine containment systems designed, constructed and operated so that fish do not escape to open water from any of its farms.  Heritage will also mark its fish as specified by the federal wildlife services, so that any escapees can be traced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will fallow its farm sites.  Maine salmon farms have been plagued by disease outbreaks, including infectious salmon anemia, a deadly virus that could spread to wild salmon.  Fallowing reduces the chance of such outbreaks, and also allows the sea floor beneath the sea cages to recover from fish farm wastes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will limit the number of fish it grows by capping the &quot;stocking density&quot; of its cages at the time when fish are most susceptible to disease.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will not discharge toxic substances in concentrations identified by the state as toxic to aquatic organisms, and sediments may not contain toxic substances originating from Heritage's farms at levels likely to have an adverse impact on marine life.  This provision addresses longstanding concerns about pesticides and other chemicals used at salmon farms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Prophylactic antibiotic use is prohibited, and Heritage must test for antibiotic residues in local fish and shellfish.  Also, detailed information about any antibiotic use will be made publicly available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will not use experimental drugs and medicines without a prior review and approval by an environmental agency.  Requests to use experimental drugs and medicines will be publicly available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Heritage will not expand its operations to Penobscot Bay during the life of the Consent Decree.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many other husbandry practices and disease control measures are specified in the consent decree, as are enhanced monitoring and public reporting requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Heritage is also paying $375,000 to fund wild Atlantic salmon restoration efforts in Washington County, where most salmon farms in Maine are located. The U.S. government put Atlantic salmon on the Endangered Species List in November 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The Consent Decree is a binding, judicially enforceable agreement between the parties resolving the lawsuit.  It comes approximately three months after federal Magistrate Judge Margaret J. Kravchuk recommended that Judge Carter grant U.S.PIRG's request for an order finding Heritage liable for violating the Clean Water Act.  U.S. PIRG was represented in the lawsuit by the National Environmental Law Center, which is headquartered in Boston, and Portland attorney Bruce Merrill.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>U.S. PIRG is a non-profit non-partisan public interest advocacy group with approximately 1,000 members in Maine.  The National Environmental Law Center is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that represents citizens and citizen groups in environmental enforcement suits.</i></font></p>
