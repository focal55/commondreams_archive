YORK - June 12 - During multiple disruptions of the awards ceremony Wednesday 
June 12 of the Global Business Council on HIV/AIDS, members of the AIDS activist 
group ACT UP and Health GAP demanded multinational corporations like Coca-Cola 
pay for medicines for employees in developing countries facing death from untreated 
HIV disease.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While activists inside the 
gala interrupted the ceremony, confronting members of Anglo-American, Coca-Cola, 
and other companies with massive workforces in Africa, other ACT UP members chanted 
from bullhorns while floating alongside the gala at Pier 60 in a boat &quot;Coke 
lies, workers die, AIDS treatment now!&quot; The ceremony, sponsored by the Global 
Business Council on HIV/AIDS, was emceed by Dan Rather and attended by Kofi Annan, 
Bill Clinton, Dick Holbrooke, and other luminaries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Crumbs from Coca-Cola 
and other corporations for workers dying with AIDS are nothing to celebrate,&quot; 
said Sharonann Lynch of both Health GAP and ACT UP New York. &quot;Companies are 
patting themselves on the back, but they have skirted their most fundamental obligation 
-- paying for treatment for their HIV positive workers.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Coca-Cola's annual shareholder's 
meeting in April 2002 activists launched a campaign singling out the beverage 
company, the largest sole private sector employer in Africa, for their refusal 
to pay for HIV treatment for workers in their bottling and distribution facilities. 
Coca-Cola, despite its massive African employee base, has offered little more 
than billboard and truck space to African country governments for anti-AIDS advertisements 
and safe sex materials. Coca-Cola has only agreed to permit treatment access for 
a handful of HIV positive employees they consider their &quot;direct employees.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Multinational companies 
have no laurels to rest on,&quot; said ACT UP New York co-founder and HIV-positive 
activist Eric Sawyer. &quot;Coca-Cola, Anglo-American and other members of the 
Global Business Council have reneged on their promises to provide antiretroviral 
treatment and care to their workers and their families. Medical apartheid is nothing 
to be proud of.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;How can Coke make 
so much profit from the labor of HIV positive employees but refuse to pay for 
AIDS medicines?&quot; asked Amanda Lugg of ACT UP New York. &quot;Africa is Coke's 
largest growth market. Coke's inaction is unconscionable.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As attendees dined inside, 
protesters knocked on the windows, held up signs, and chanted names of companies 
that had shirked their responsibility in paying for workplace treatment. &quot;Last 
year Coca-Cola and Anglo-American grabbed headlines with announcements of workplace 
initiatives. In the past twelve months, Anglo-American has reneged twice on its 
treatment policy, while Coca-Cola has failed to treat its workers and their families,&quot; 
said protester Eustacia Smith of ACT UP New York. &quot;Meanwhile there are 8,000 
deaths and 14,000 new HIV infections every day.&quot;</font></p>
