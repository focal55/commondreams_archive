ANGELES - July 19 - Vowing her continued commitment to the struggle against Ecuador&#8217;s 

OCP oil pipeline, Julia Butterfly Hill will speak to the press today at 10.30 

am outside the LA offices of Occidental Petroleum located at Wilshire and Westwood 

Blvds. Julia was arrested and jailed along with seven Ecuadorians outside Occidental 

Petroleum (OXY)&#8217;s Quito offices on Tuesday, during a peaceful protest against 

Ecuador&#8217;s new OCP pipeline. Julia Butterfly arrived in Los Angeles last 

night after being forcibly deported from Ecuador presumably so that the government 

could avoid the international attention her scheduled court appearance would have 

generated on the controversial OCP project. The other seven protesters were all 

released yesterday following their court appearance. All charges were dropped.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT: Press conference <br>

WHEN: TODAY, Friday 10.30 am <br>

WHERE: Outside Occidental Petroleum&#8217;s headquarters, 10889 Wilshire Boulevard, 

at Westwood</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the Tuesday protest in Quito where Ms. Hill was arrested, 50 community members 

from Mindo, Lago Agrio, Esmeraldas and Shushufindi, who are adversely affected 

by the new pipeline or by Oxy&#8217;s operations, rallied outside the offices 

of Oxy to demand an end to the escalating destruction of their lands. Five representatives 

from the affected communities asked for a meeting with Oxy. Oxy refused only agreeing 

to meet with Julia Butterfly. Oxy&#8217;s offices were shut down for over two 

hours by the rally, and demonstrators disrupted traffic on a nearby Quito thoroughfare, 

clamoring for their case to be heard. Eventually, Oxy met with Amazon Watch and 

five representatives from affected communities.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As she was brutally dragged by six immigration police officers through the 

Quito airport yesterday morning, peacefully resisting deportation until the end, 

Julia called out to bystanders:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I&#8217;m being deported against my will. I&#8217;m being deported is 

because I&#8217;ve lent my solidarity to the forests of Ecuador and the communities 

defending their lands and their basic human rights.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ms. Hill, best known for her 738 day tree-sit 200 feet atop a 1000-year old 

threatened California old-growth redwood tree arrived in Ecuador July 9, joining 

the national struggle to resist the OCP pipeline. On Monday she accompanied Mindo 

community members to bear witness to OCP&#8217;s construction site in the Mindo 

Nambillo Cloudforest Reserve. Construction has now trespassed 200 meters inside 

Mindo community-owned property. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The OCP pipeline has been mired in controversy since its inception, with hundreds 

of protests over the last few months along its route, which crosses fragile ecosystems 

and affects 11 protected areas. Los Angeles-based Oxy is a key member of the OCP 

consortium, and is planning significant expansion of its Ecuador operations in 

pristine Amazon ecosystems, in expectation of the pipeline&#8217;s completion. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The majority of Amazon crude that will flow through the pipeline is destined 

for US West Coast markets. The OCP Consortium includes: Alberta Energy (Canada), 

Occidental Petroleum (OXY- USA), AGIP (Italy), Repsol-YPF (Spain), Perez Companc 

(Argentina), and Techint (Argentina). German bank WestLB is lead financer of the 

project and JP Morgan Chase is the project&#8217;s financial advisor. </font></p>
