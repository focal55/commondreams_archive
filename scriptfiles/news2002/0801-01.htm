- August 1 - The timber industry has announced it's suing the U.S. government 

to force the release of 16 shipments of Brazilian mahogany that Greenpeace, the 

Brazilian government and the U.S. Department of Interior have deemed either illegal 

or under investigation. The plaintiffs claim that they had all of the necessary 

paper work, including valid export permits issued by the Brazilian government. 

Greenpeace, however, uncovered evidence that these permits' validity is highly 

questionable and that the mahogany itself was illegally extracted following a 

ban on all mahogany exports put in place by Brazil in October of 2001.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The timber industry is abusing the legal system for illegal gains,&quot; 

said Scott Paul, Greenpeace Forest Campaign Coordinator. &quot;President Bush 

announced that the U.S. was going to become a leader in combating illegal logging 

and this lawsuit undermines any efforts to fight the outbreak of illegal logging 

that is destroying ancient forests around the world.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before issuing a permit for timber export, the Convention that Oversees Trade 

in Endangered Species (CITES), which oversees endangered mahogany, requires each 

country's designated agency be satisfied that the product was legally harvested. 

In the case of these shipments, the designated agency was Brazil's environmental 

agency IBAMA. IBAMA had shutdown the country's mahogany trade in October, 2001 

citing widespread corruption and illegalities. According to CITES, only IBAMA, 

not the courts or even the president of the country has the authority to issue 

these permits. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As reported in the news earlier this year, Greenpeace uncovered evidence that 

mahogany shipments were continuing into the United States following Brazil's ban. 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife sought clarification from Brazil about the legal status 

of the shipments mentioned in this lawsuit. So far the Brazilian government has 

requested that the United States continue to hold the mahogany and Greenpeace 

called for its return to Brazil to aid the government's efforts to track and combat 

illegal logging. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If these plaintiffs continue with this ill-advised lawsuit, it will just 

continue to shake people's confidence in the ethics of U.S. corporations,&quot; 

continued Paul. &quot;These companies have an opportunity to join President Bush's 

initiative to combat illegal logging and to be part of the solution - instead 

of fueling the problem.&quot;</font></p>
