SOUTH AFRICA - June 27 - OneWorld (www.oneworld.net), the online sustainable development 
and human rights network, announces the launch of OneWorld Radio AIDS Network 
<a href="http://www.oneworld.net/radio/aids" target="_new">www.oneworld.net/radio/aids</a>.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OneWorld Radio AIDS Network is a community of broadcasters, NGOs and activists 
coming together in the fight against AIDS. The network launches with 100 member 
organizations and radio stations across the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Globally, radio programming is being used to share experiences of AIDS and 
to give advice on reducing risk and supporting those living with HIV/AIDS. The 
medium can provide facts on HIV/AIDS in the face of fear and stigma to combat 
discrimination and prejudice. Radio is also critical in raising awareness and 
understanding of AIDS not just as a health and social issue but also as a political, 
development and human rights concern.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the wealth of AIDS awareness and other audio material produced by NGOs, 
government agencies and broadcasters is usually restricted to the geographical 
area where it has been produced and aired. It then often remains unheard by wider 
audiences.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Internet provides a 
solution to this problem. OneWorld Radio AIDS Network has a searchable database 
exchange of audio files that allows broadcasters and other programme producers 
to upload and download AIDS programming in any language on the World Wide Web. 
Radio stations around the world can then rebroadcast this copyright-free material 
or adapt it for their own audiences. Anyone with Internet access can listen to 
the programmes online at OneWorld Radio AIDS Network <a href="http://www.oneworld.net/radio/aids" target="_new">www.oneworld.net/radio/aids</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;For now, with no cure in sight, information and communication are our 
only effective weapons to beat AIDS/HIV,&#8221; said Priscilla Jere, director 
of OneWorld Africa. &#8220;OneWorld Radio AIDS Network links the power of radio 
with the networking potential of the Internet to make the connections that can 
really help limit the human suffering and devastation of HIV/AIDS.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The OneWorld Radio AIDS Network website also includes news, training materials, 
funding information and other practical resources for national and community broadcasters, 
health educators and campaigners as well as people working in AIDS/HIV organizations, 
aid agencies and development NGOs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Combining technology and 
information with this community of organizations and individuals, OneWorld Radio 
AIDS Network aims to make a real difference to the lives of millions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notes:<br>
