- June 13 - On June 11, President George W. Bush addressed the annual meeting 
of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) via satellite. While Bush lauded the 
SBC for upholding the ideals of religious tolerance, civility and the separation 
of church and state, SBC leaders' own remarks told a different story. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;President Bush should 
repudiate SBC leaders' rejection of the American tradition of religious pluralism 
and their appeals to bigotry,&quot; said People For the American Way Foundation 
President Ralph G. Neas. &quot;At a time when President Bush has called Americans 
to unity, he should not be embracing leaders whose message is grounded in sowing 
division.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush told convention 
delegates that &quot;Baptists have had an extraordinary influence on American 
history. They were among the earliest champions of religious tolerance and freedom. 
Baptists have long upheld the ideal of a free church in a free state. And from 
the beginning, they believed that forcing a person to worship against his will 
violated the principles of both Christianity and civility.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Neas said that while it 
is true that for many years Southern Baptists were among the strongest proponents 
of church-state separation and individual conscience in matters of religion, since 
the fundamentalist takeover of the denomination in the 1980s, it has been a far 
different story. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Unfortunately, President 
Bush wasn't present to hear Southern Baptist leaders' own take on religious pluralism 
and civility,&quot; Neas said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The night before President 
Bush lavished praise on the SBC, the Rev. Jerry Vines, a former president of the 
SBC, told several thousand convention delegates that many of this country's problems 
could be blamed on &quot;religious pluralism,&quot; according to news accounts. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, Vines harshly 
criticized Islam: &quot;They would have us believe that Islam is just as good 
as Christianity. Christianity was founded by the virgin-born son of God, Jesus 
Christ. Islam was founded by Muhammad, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 
wives, the last one of which was a 9-year-old girl.&quot; Vines continued, &quot;And 
I will tell you Allah is not Jehovah either. Jehovah's not going to turn you into 
a terrorist that'll try to bomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands 
of people.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newly elected SBC President 
Rev. Jack Graham called Vines' comments &quot;an accurate statement.&quot; Outgoing 
SBC President Dr. James Merritt also backed Vines, saying, &quot;historically, 
he is on solid ground.&quot; </font></p>
