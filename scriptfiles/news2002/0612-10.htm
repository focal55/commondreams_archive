- June 12 - The Union of Concerned Scientists today released the following statement 
by Dr. David Wright, physicist and senior scientist, Union of Concerned Scientists, 
and research fellow, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on the official withdrawal 
from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty on Thursday, June 13. The United 
States gave notice of its intent to withdraw last December. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Having withdrawn from the treaty and increased the missile defense budget 
by more than 45 percent, the Bush administration can no longer point to the treaty 
and lack of money as the stumbling blocks to building a national missile defense 
system. Technology remains the key barrier to building missile defenses that are 
effective against real-world attacks. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Unfortunately, the Bush administration plans to address the technical 
difficulties by sleight of hand and greater secrecy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;First, rather than waiting until the technical issues are addressed, 
it plans to rush immature defense systems into the field beginning in 2004 -- 
well before the testing program will have subjected the technology to anything 
like real-world conditions. These systems will not provide 'emergency capability' 
against real-world threats, only the illusion of capability. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Second, the Bush administration plans to hide its development program 
behind new layers of classification. As a first step, it is classifying basic 
information about upcoming tests, but more sweeping restrictions are expected, 
according to insiders familiar with the program. While the Pentagon says these 
restrictions are needed to keep crucial information from falling into enemy hands, 
the development and testing programs are at such early stages that this argument 
doesn't hold water. A more likely motivation seems to be to deny critics both 
in and out of government access to the information needed to assess the state 
of the technology, and thereby to keep these issues out of the public debate.&quot;
