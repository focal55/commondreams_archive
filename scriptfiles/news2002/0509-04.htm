<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 9 -  The following is a statement 

by Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After years of obstructing President Clinton's judicial nominees, 

some Republicans are now threatening to shut down the Senate simply 

for doing its job -- carefully scrutinizing all candidates for these 

prestigious lifetime positions. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman 

Patrick Leahy has pledged to move non-controversial, consensus 

nominees quickly, and he has done precisely that. The Senate has 

confirmed 52 judicial nominees to date, of whom nine are nominees to 

the courts of appeals. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Senator Leahy has said repeatedly, reviewing the records of 

problematic, divisive candidates takes more time. President Bush's 

nominees are problematic and present a real threat to established 

rights that Americans have come to cherish. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Would you believe that some Republicans want the Senate to 

rubberstamp nominees who: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Denied a workers' compensation claim by a man who had been 

severely beaten by a fellow employee after the man responded 

truthfully to a supervisor's question regarding whether the fellow 

employee had left work early (Deborah Cook, 6th Circuit nominee); </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

-- Are regarded as so anti-consumer and supportive of business 

that the conservative Washington Times would describe them as &quot;offer(ing) business the best opportunity in years to free itself 

from government regulations&quot; (Miguel Estrada and John Roberts, D.C. 

Circuit nominees); </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Strongly criticized fellow state supreme court justices for 

expediting their decision in a case involving a pregnant minor who 

had already endured a month of court proceedings over whether she 

could have an abortion without notifying her parents, and who was 

criticized by then fellow state Supreme Court Justice, now-White 

House Counsel Gonzales for engaging in an &quot;unconscionable act of 

judicial activism&quot; for her actions in that case (Priscilla Owen, 5th 

Circuit nominee);</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Waited eleven years to resign from an all-male club, at which important professional contacts are made, after promising the Senate Judiciary Committee that, if confirmed to the district court, he 

would resign right away if he were unsuccessful in persuading the 

club to change its policy. He finally did withdraw from the club in 

December 1999, but only after the appellate seat for which he is now 

being considering became open. (D. Brooks Smith, 3rd Circuit 

nominee); </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Dismissed a claim for invasion of privacy by a woman whose 

doctor had allowed a pharmaceutical company representative in the 

room during the woman's breast exam, a decision reversed by the state 

appellate court (Carolyn Kuhl, 9th Circuit nominee) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are just a few examples of actions taken by some of this 

administration's very problematic judicial nominees. They raise 

serious questions about the respect these nominees have for the 

longstanding role of the federal judiciary as guarantor of equal 

justice for all and for Congress's role in enacting critical rights 

and protections. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Republicans message today is very different from that of 

then-Senate Majority Leader Lott, who in 1996 said on the Senate 

floor: &quot;Should we take our time and look at these people who are 

nominated to be Federal judges for life and hold sway over us in ways 

that exceed our imagination.... Yes. Do I have any apologies? Only 

one: I probably moved too many already.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By contrast, Senate Democrats have confirmed relatively 

non-controversial nominees at a rapid pace and made clear that they 

will undertake a thorough, deliberative evaluation of all appellate 

nominees. To do any less would be to further jeopardize established 

rights and protections that Americans cherish. </font></p>
