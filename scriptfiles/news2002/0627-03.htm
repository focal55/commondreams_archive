<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - June 
27 - World Wildlife Fund today called on Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium 
producer, to live up to its own environmental standards and pull out of a project 
that would destroy Dimmugljufur Canyon, one of Iceland's great wilderness areas. 
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The project would see Alcoa, known 
for household brands like Reynolds Wrap(r) and Baco(r) foil, building a giant 
aluminium smelter in Iceland's Eastern Highlands. At the same time, the Icelandic 
government would construct a major dam complex to power the smelter. Alcoa claims 
that leadership in environmental, health, and safety performance is inseparable 
from its aspiration to be the best company in the world. However, this joint project 
will submerge parts of Dimmugljufur canyon, and breeding grounds for pink-footed 
geese and reindeer, under a 22 square-mile reservoir. It will also involve the 
construction of three giant dams and miles of new roads and tunnels. The project 
will dam and divert two of the three main river systems in the area, cutting off 
the vital arteries that feed streams, wetlands and habitat for wildlife. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Alcoa's performance in environment, 
health and safety has qualified the company as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Indexes (DJSI)," said Samantha Smith, director of WWF's Arctic Program. "Although 
they publicly emphasize their environmental principles, a decision to build this 
smelter would help destroy one of the last great wilderness areas of Western Europe. 
WWF is calling on Alcoa to live up to its environmental principles and back out 
of this devastating project." </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alcoa's move is all the more surprising 
given that it follows a decision by the Norwegian multinational, Norsk Hydro, 
to withdraw from the project after substantial criticism from environmental groups 
and an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that concluded that the project would 
have huge and negative consequences on the area. On the basis of the EIA, the 
Icelandic Planning Agency ruled that the project should not go forward. Subsequently 
the Icelandic government overturned that ruling, and allowed the project -- a 
decision that has now been challenged in court. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WWF is calling on Alcoa, which has 
129,000 employees worldwide and last year generated revenues of $22.9 billion, 
to live up to its environmental principles and back out of its joint plan with 
the Icelandic Government. The Alcoa board will take a final decision on the project 
on 11 July. The CEO of WWF-US, Kathryn S. Fuller, sits on Alcoa's board and has 
raised WWF's opposition to the project with the company at the highest level. 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WWF is supporting calls by Icelandic 
NGOs for the Eastern Highlands to be declared a national park. Such a park would 
ensure long-term protection for the highlands that risk to be affected by the 
Alcoa project. This could create more jobs through tourism than will be generated 
by the power and aluminum development, at much lower cost. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Everywhere we look, the Arctic is 
under pressure. From the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the Barents Sea, and 
now the Dimmugljufur Canyon, governments and industry see the Arctic as a new 
frontier for large-scale industrial development. What they don't see is that the 
Arctic is one of the last places left on earth where nature still works as it 
has for centuries. When we lose this, we'll never be able to get it back," Smith 
added. </font>
