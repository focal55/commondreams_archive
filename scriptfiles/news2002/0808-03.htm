JORDAN - August 8 - Israel today refused entry to a nine-person U.S. Congressional 

staff delegation co-sponsored by American Muslims for Jerusalem (AMJ) and Jews 

for Peace in Palestine and Israel (JPPI). This was to have been the first Jewish-Muslim 

co-sponsored Congressional delegation to Palestine and Israel. The bi-partisan 

delegation planned to meet with Israeli and Palestinian peace activists, American 

and international humanitarian organizations, and U.S. government officials.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The delegation, which consisted of 

staffers from six Congressional offices along with three AMJ and JPPI representatives, 

attempted to enter from Jordan the Israeli-occupied West Bank via the Allenby 

Bridge. After five hours, Israeli security personnel informed the delegation that 

the Ministry of Interior refused entry to the six Congressional staffers and the 

two AMJ staff members. The JPPI staff member, who is a dual American and Israeli 

citizen, was not refused entry but chose to return to Jordan with the remainder 

of the delegation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Israeli authorities held the 

passports of all nine members of the delegation, an Israeli policeman, Alexander 

Frumin, implied that violence might be used against the Congressional staff delegation, 

indicating that the situation could lead to &#8220;blows.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Josh Ruebner, co-founder 

of JPPI, &#8220;Members of Congress and the American people should be outraged 

by Israel&#8217;s refusal to admit a Congressional staff delegation. This unprecedented 

slap in the face to Members of Congress is Israel&#8217;s way of repaying the 

institution which gives it $3 billion of tax-payer money every year. What does 

Israel not want Congress to see?&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congressional staffers requested 

that the U.S. Consulate in East Jerusalem intervene on behalf of the delegation. 

They were informed that the Consulate would intervene for everyone but the two 

American Muslims on the delegation. Khalid Turaani, Executive Director of AMJ, 

stated &#8220;I am sickened that representatives of my government would condone 

Israel&#8217;s blatant ethnic and religious profiling. The State Department consistently 

has winked at Israel&#8217;s pattern of discrimination against and intimidation 

of American Muslims seeking to further peace and to provide humanitarian assistance 

to Palestinians suffering under Israel&#8217;s brutal military occupation.&#8221;
