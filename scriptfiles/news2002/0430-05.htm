- April 30 - An ad hoc coalition of

people of faith and leaders in the religious community today called

on President George Bush to release the full $34 million appropriated

for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for Fiscal Year 2002.

In a letter to the president, 136 religious leaders from 31 countries

said, "As a UN agency, UNFPA is vital to the reproductive health

needs of women, men and their families by providing life-saving

services such as family planning, and HIV/AIDS prevention, counseling

and services to people living in developing countries around the

world. As people of faith, we understand that women and men must

have access to information and services so they can act morally and

responsibly in their sexual behavior. Highly respected religious

leaders have supported modern family planning as a moral good."

<p>The letter, which was signed by Buddhists, Christians, Muslims,

Hindus and Jews, went on to note that, "We believe that UNFPA has

been unequivocally committed to providing informed and voluntary

family planning. The agency has used, and continues to use, its

stature as a UN agency to help governments, like China, to move more

and more towards respect for the rights of women and men to decide

for themselves on the number and spacing of their children and to

move away from draconian practices."

<p>"In the Catholic tradition, caring for the poor and marginalized

is a key social teaching. Too often, this value is neglected when

conservative Catholic leaders lobby to cut off family planning

services or funding. The Catholic leaders who have signed this letter

to President Bush know that you can be Catholic and support family

planning and they know that women's and children's lives are saved

when voluntary family planning is available," said Frances Kissling,

president of Catholics for a Free Choice in Washington, D.C.

<p>"For Muslim women, family planning is key to their empowerment,

and their ability to live responsible Muslim lives," said Zainah

Anwar, executive director, Sisters In Islam, Malaysia.

<p>"I understand President Bush's concern about abortion, but every

dollar spent on family planning means less illegal, unsafe abortion.

Denying UNFPA funding causes more harm than good, in that it means

less contraception, producing more unwanted pregnancies and therefore

more abortions," said the Rev. Dr. James Martin-Schramm, associate

professor of Religion at Luther College in Decorah, IA.

<br>LETTER FOLLOWS

<p>President George W. Bush

<br>The White House

<br>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue

<br>Washington, DC 20500

<p>Dear President Bush,

<p>As people of faith and leaders in the religious community, we are

deeply concerned that you are considering defunding the United

Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). We urge you to release the full

appropriation of $34 million for the UNFPA in the Fiscal Year 2002

Budget. Religious leaders actively supported the founding of the UN

and continue to believe that the UN and its agencies are critical

vehicles for world peace and justice. We recognize the importance of

the United Nations in providing the world with humanitarian

assistance, especially to those living in developing countries. As

a

UN agency, UNFPA is vital to the reproductive health needs of women,

men and their families by providing life-saving services such as

family planning, and HIV/AIDS prevention, counseling and services to

people living in developing countries around the world.

<p>As people of faith, we understand that women and men must have

access to information and services so they can act morally and

responsibly in their sexual behavior. Highly respected religious

leaders have supported modern family planning as a moral good.

<p>The Dalai Lama has said that "family planning is crucial,

especially in the developing world." Anglican Bishop Desmund Tutu

stated, "Planned parenthood is an obligation of those who are

Christians. Our church thinks we should use scientific methods that

assist in planning families."

<p>As people of faith we oppose any coercive measures in reproductive

health. We believe that UNFPA has been unequivocally committed to

providing informed and voluntary family planning. The agency has

used, and continues to use, its stature as a UN agency to help

governments, like China, to move more and more towards respect for

the rights of women and men to decide for themselves on the number

and spacing of their children and to move away from draconian

practices. The agency deserves and needs your support.

<p>Again, we respectfully urge you to respond with compassion and

provide $34 million for the UNFPA to help them promote the health and

well-being of women and families around the world.

<p>Sincerely,
