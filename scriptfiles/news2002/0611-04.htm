<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO   - June 11 - Today the Bluewater Network released a report uncovering new information about how the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transportation (DOT) are misleading consumers and the US Congress by overestimating the average fuel economy of passenger vehicles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The release of Bluewater's report, entitled Fuel Economy Falsehoods: How government misrepresentation of fuel economy hinders efforts to reduce global warming and US dependence on foreign oil, coincides with Bluewater Network's submission today of a rulemaking petition to the EPA and DOT in an effort to pressure the agencies to address this problem. The petition urges EPA and DOT to revise the outdated test procedures and calculation methods to more accurately reflect today's driving conditions, and to report this more accurate information to consumers and policy makers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fuel Economy Falsehoods brings attention to major discrepancies between how federal agencies portray fuel economy and the actual fuel economy which motorists achieve in real-world driving. While EPA proclaims that the average fuel economy of model year 2001 vehicles was 23.9 miles per gallon (mpg), and DOT informed Congress that this figure stood at 24.8 mpg, Bluewater's report demonstrates that these vehicles are actually getting only 20 mpg on the road, a difference of nearly 20 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report divulges that the test procedures and calculation methods EPA uses to determine fuel economy are based on surveys of traffic patterns conducted more than two decades ago. Significant increases in urban congestion, average highway driving speeds, and the percentage of driving taking place in urban areas have rendered the testing and calculation methods obsolete. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network said. &quot;Our federal agencies are lying to the public and policymakers about the average fuel mileage of American vehicles. Overstating our fuel economy makes it even more difficult to solve the problem of global warming because decision-makers need to rely on accurate and reliable information -- not propaganda. With global warming threatening our nation, and US petroleum consumption at all-time highs, this is no time to play numbers games that hide the declining fuel economy of America's passenger vehicles.&quot;</font></p>
