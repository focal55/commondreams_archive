- September 5 - Serious human rights violations have occurred as a consequence 

of the UK authorities' response to the 11 September attacks in the USA, states 

Amnesty International's report &quot;Rights denied: the UK's response to 11 September 

2001&quot; released today.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report denounces the treatment and conditions of detention of those detained 

in the aftermath of the events of 11 September. Detainees have been subjected 

to &quot;small-group isolation&quot;; and continue to be held in 22-hour-a-day 

lock-up. They have not received adequate health care and their right to religious 

exercise was limited. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The regime under which 

detainees are held can lead to a serious physical and mental deterioration of 

their health which, in turn, could undermine their capacity to prepare their defense,&quot; 

said Livio Zilli, Amnesty International's researcher on the UK.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Detainees were denied prompt access to a solicitor. Upon their arrest and detention 

at Belmarsh Prison all of them were refused permission to make telephone calls 

to solicitors, whether they had pre-existing solicitors or not. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The detainees' contact with relatives and the outside world has been severely 

impeded. Social visits with relatives are tape-recorded and have a prison officer 

present despite, in some instances, a glass screen separating the detainee from 

visitors. Detainees stated that they were strip-searched before and after every 

visit. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially, detainees were only allowed to communicate with family members in 

English or through an interpreter. On one occasion, a detainee complained that 

his visit could not proceed unless English only was spoken because his interpreter 

was not being admitted to the unit as she was refusing to remove her headscarf. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of 17 July 2002, none of those detained under the Anti-terrorism, Crime 

and Security Act 2001 (ATCSA) had been interviewed by the UK authorities. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The government has effectively created a shadow justice system devoid 

of the crucial components and safeguards present in the criminal justice system,&quot; 

said Livio Zilli. Amnesty International is today presenting a Memorandum to the 

UK Government urging it to address these deficiencies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The case of the Algerian Lotfi Raissi is a powerful illustration that 

in the search for 'suspected terrorists' innocent people can get caught up -- 

violating their rights and those of their relatives to liberty and livelihood,&quot; 

said Livio Zilli.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lotfi Raissi was arrested and detained for five months in Belmarsh high security 

prison, after the US authorities sought his extradition on the basis of suspicions 

concerning his involvement in the 11 September attacks. The extradition proceedings 

were brought to an end seven months later after the presiding judge ruled that 

he had received no evidence to support the US claims. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The US authorities' reasons for seeking Lotfi Raissi's extradition included 

the fact that his identity and profession fit a certain profile: an Algerian man 

and a Muslim, a pilot and a flight instructor in the USA,&quot; said Livio Zilli.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amnesty International received confirmation from the UK authorities in May, 

that seven UK nationals were being detained in Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba. The 

authorities also confirmed that the men had twice been &quot;visited&quot; by 

UK officials, including some from MI5 and that they had been interviewed in relation 

to issues relevant to the UK's national security. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UK authorities have failed to make representations to protect the rights 

of their nationals being held in Guant&aacute;namo, where they are denied prisoner 

of war status. In particular, Amnesty International is concerned that detainees, 

including UK nationals, have been denied access to legal counsel during questioning 

by US and UK intelligence officers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The defense of human 

rights begins at home. The UK authorities' real commitment to human rights is 

now being put to the test,&quot; Livio Zilli concluded.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eleven people have been detained without charge or trial, for an unspecified 

and potentially unlimited period of time, following their certification by the 

Secretary of State as &quot;suspected international terrorists&quot; under the 

ATCSA. The certification is based on secret information, which has not been disclosed 

to the detainees and which cannot be effectively challenged by them or by lawyers 

of their choice. At least another 25 people have been reportedly arrested under 

the Terrorism Act 2000, some of whom have been released without charge. The UK 

authorities have also detained a number of individuals on extradition warrants 

received from other governments, including the French and the US authorities.</font></p>
