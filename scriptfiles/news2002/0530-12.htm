- May 30 - Some legal experts are criticizing the decision announced Thursday by Attorney General John Ashcroft to modify existing guidelines that govern FBI intelligence, foreign

counter-intelligence investigations and domestic security terrorism

investigations. Among those available for interviews:

President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, Ratner said today: "The current

Guidelines were established in the '70s and early '80s after it was

demonstrated that the FBI was spying upon and disrupting groups and individuals

engaged in lawful dissent. Apparently, Attorney General Ashcroft wants to get

the FBI back in the business of spying on religious and political

organizations. That alone would be unconstitutional but history suggests the

FBI won't stop at passive information-gathering. We fear a return to the days

of Cointelpro. By its own terms, Cointelpro -- a widespread domestic spying

operation whose best-known target was Martin Luther King Jr. -- was designed to

'misdirect, discredit, disrupt and otherwise neutralize' political and activist

groups. Under its auspices, the FBI and local authorities went far beyond

passive surveillance, harassing a vast number of protest groups, infiltrated

them with provocateurs, devised and implemented disinformation campaigns....

Even with the Attorney General's Guidelines in place, the FBI has abused its

powers. In 1987 CCR exposed the widespread spying that was directed against

activists opposed to U.S. policy in Central America. Known as the CISPES

investigation, the bureau kept files on lawful dissenters across the country

and placed informants in peace groups in an effort to dampen opposition to U.S.

policy."

Associate professor at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, Cohn said today: "The FBI is reinventing itself by resurrecting a counter-intelligence program similar to

the dreaded Cointelpro, which was eliminated by Congress after the FBI used it

to abuse civil liberties in the '50s, '60s and '70s. In response to Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr.'s involvement in the movement to register African-Americans to

vote, the FBI undertook an aggressive smear campaign to discredit and destroy

him. Saying that Dr. King 'represented a clear threat to the established order

of the U.S.,' the FBI wiretapped his telephones and hotel rooms and obtained

highly personal information it used to try to wreck his marriage, drive him to

suicide, and discredit him in the eyes of the U.S. government, the religious

community, and foreign governments. Now, as the result of the FBI's

incompetence in analyzing information that was already available under pre-existing

guidelines before Sept. 11, the Justice Department has promulgated new rules,

giving the FBI wide latitude to spy on Internet communications, libraries,

political and religious organizations without probable cause. This ominous new

development in the war on terrorism threatens the constitutional rights of

law-abiding citizens."
