- July 23 - James Zogby, President of the Arab American Institute (AAI), reiterated 

the Institute's demand that the Bush Administration initiate an investigation 

of possible violations of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) by Israel in light 

of the recent killing and wounding of civilians in Gaza City. The Senate foreign 

operations appropriations subcommittee just approved $2.1 billion in military 

assistance for Israel for FY03, in addition to emergency and supplemental grants 

already made for Israel's participation in counter-terrorism activities. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Israel has demonstrated once again that it is not interested in pursuing 

policies that build credible alternatives to violence in its relations with the 

Palestinians. As various leaders toil to reduce levels of violence, the Sharon 

government responds with this attack, and then routinely apologizes for the collateral 

deaths of 16 people and the wounding of more than 150 men, women and children. 

This is not what US arms are intended for, and Israel's continued violation of 

US statutes regarding the use of American arms is a shame on their government, 

and a shame on the Bush Administration whose words are not followed by actions. 

If President Bush seriously believes that this attack by an F-16 is &quot;heavy-handed&quot;, 

then the U.S. should act to restrain such Israeli behavior.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zogby noted that calling the casualties &quot;collateral damage&quot; did not 

exonerate Israel from guilt for the disproportionate violence of the attack. &quot;This 

deliberate targeting of a building in a neighborhood populated by hundreds of 

innocents cannot be erased by calling them collateral damage. Palestinians are 

human beings, and just as we regret the loss of Israeli civilians and condemn 

the attacks against them, we mourn the mounting Palestinian casualties and condemn 

Israeli occupation policies that prolong the cycle of violence.&quot; </font></p>
