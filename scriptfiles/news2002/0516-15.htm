- May 16 - The following is a 

statement of Vicki Saporta, president and CEO of the National 

Abortion Federation on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in 

Planned Parenthood v. ACLA that 'wanted' posters and the Nuremberg 

Files Web site are not protected speech: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are very pleased with today's decision. This establishes 

that threatening speech, 'Wanted' posters and threatening Internet 

sites are not protected by the First Amendment. This decision will 

help ensure that the recent decrease in extreme forms of violence 

will continue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Ninth Circuit recognized today that these threats are real 

because of the overall context in which they have been occurring. 

The National Abortion Federation has been collecting statistics on 

incidents of violence and disruption against abortion providers for 

over twenty years, and since 1977 we have documented seven murders, 

17 attempted murders, 41 bombings and 165 arsons. Two of these 

murders occurred after the distribution of 'Wanted' posters. 

Additionally, a line was struck through Dr. Barnett Slepian's name 

on the Nuremberg Files Web site shortly after he was murdered in 

1998. Clearly, a link exists between these threats and the violence 

that subsequently occurred. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Health care professionals should not be threatened, 

intimidated, or terrorized for providing legal reproductive health 

care services to women. Regardless of one's position on a woman's 

right to choose abortion, today's decision should be welcomed by 

all those who believe that violence and threats of violence cannot 

be tolerated by our society.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The National Abortion Federation is the professional association 

of abortion providers, with member facilities throughout the U.S. 

and Canada. NAF is dedicated to ensuring that abortion remains 

safe, legal and accessible. </i></font></p>
