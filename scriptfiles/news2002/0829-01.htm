<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 29 - 

The International Committee of the Green Party of the United States will introduce 

a set of eight demands at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (&quot;Earth 

Summit&quot;) this week. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The eight demands, appended below, stress the need for wealthy nations to lead 

the world in overturning policies that have led to a global climate crisis, fossil 

fuel dependence, arms races and the threat of war, and an increasing gap between 

rich and poor. The demands have been distributed to the major NGO groups officially 

affiliated with the U.N. yesterday at the official site of the summit, the Sandton 

Convention Center in Johannesburg, South Africa. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The demands from the U.S. Green delegation address the ruin that trade 

authorities such as the WTO, IMF, and the World Bank are causing worldwide,&quot; 

said Tim Harthan, Green Party candidate in Iowa for the U.S. Senate. &quot;These 

secretive, anti-democratic cabals wreak havoc on the environment, on human rights 

and democracy, and on the health and local economies. They overrule local and 

national environmental, health, and labor protections and force privatization 

of public resources and services, all in the name of investment and the market. 

It really means turning developing nations into feeding troughs for corporate 

profit.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the top of the list, say Greens, is fresh water, privatization of which 

has caused economic hardship and disease around the world. In Cochabamba, Bolivia, 

a World Bank mandate in 1999 to hand over the ownership of water to the California-based 

Bechtel corporation meant that prices for fresh water rose to a quarter of monthly 

earnings for many people. Privatization of water last year caused epidemics of 

cholera and typhoid in Ghana.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The attempt by multinational corporations to control water supplies is 

yet another example of the need to reverse global warming and effect regulations 

to prevent hardships among those too poor to afford the price of water,&quot; 

said Ted Glick, New Jersey candidate for the U.S. Senate, who noted that global 

corporations already own or operate water systems that bring them profits of $200 

billion a year and serve only 7% of the world's population. &quot;Water, so necessary 

to life's existence, should not be an item of trade for profit,&quot; Glick added. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Green International Committee co-chair Annie Goeke, in a speech at the People's 

Forum for WEDO (Women's Environmental Development Organization) Women's Action 

Tent on Monday, August 26, criticized the U.S.'s current military buildup, calling 

it symptomatic of the Resource War syndrome. &quot;This form of leadership under 

the banner of 'War on Terrorism' has further allowed countries and in particular 

'developing' nations to neglect the care for their people as they scramble to 

arm themselves with the latest high tech warfare equipment,&quot; said Goeke.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Greens at the Earth Summit 

will also introduce a petition calling for self-government in the form of statehood 

for the District of Columbia. Organized by the D.C. Statehood Green Party, the 

petition will be presented to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's a disgrace that, in the capital of the free world, American citizens 

are denied democracy and equal protection under the law,&quot; said Adam Eidinger, 

Statehood Green Party candidate for 'Shadow' U.S. Representative for the District. 

&quot;The only solution to Congress's power to impose unwanted and destructive 

policies on D.C. is political self-determination. It's no coincidence that the 

majority of the District's population is African-American, so our situation here 

is comparable to that of nonwhite developing nations throughout the world -- which 

also suffer unwanted and destructive policies imposed by international trade institutions 

acting on orders from the U.S. and other wealthy nations.&quot;</font></p>

<b>Demands for Johannesburg: Eight Key Steps to Global Renewal.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking Towards Johannesburg The Environment, Development, Security, and Democracy 

Eight Steps to Global Renewal [International Committee of the Green Party of the 

United States]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction and Summary</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The World Summit on Sustainable Development will occur in late August of this 

year, in Johannesberg, South Africa on the 10th anniversary of the Earth Summit 

held in Rio in 1992. The prospect facing the planet, its eco-systems and its peoples, 

has not improved in spite of Rio&sup1;s high hopes; indeed, they are arguably 

in a much worse condition. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The gap between rich and poor, both within nations and among the nations of 

the world, is greater than ever. Natural resources continue to be extracted without 

sufficient attention to the impact on the environment or the long term impact 

on the availability of resources for future generations. The planet's forests, 

fish, and available water supplies are diminishing due to reckless exploitation 

and mismanagement. Conditions for working people have become much worse. Climate 

change, global warming, and poisonous air are by common consent now major catastrophes 

in the making. Consumers are increasingly exposed to food and water and products 

of all kinds that are inimical to their health. Communities everywhere are suffering 

greater threats to neighborhood, family values, security of livelihood and physical 

safety, often coupled with deadly threats to their eco-systems. The world is increasingly 

wracked by a deadly arms race and a misguided war on terrorism. The leadership 

of the most powerful countries is in the grip of an obsession for more fossil 

fuels instead of making a necessary shift to renewable energy sources. The hopes 

for greater democracy heralded by the Rio Summit have all but faded away. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper explores the global political context and proposes steps that can 

be taken to transform global governance and policies vis-a-vis the environment, 

development, and democracy. First, six steps, then a background analysis, and 

a conclusion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eight Steps to Global Renewal</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Make the closed deliberations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) open 

to NGO participation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Require the WTO dispute resolution panels to give as much priority to environmental, 

labor, and consumer standards as they do to standards of market fairness and freedom 

of trade. In this regard, it must become the norm that the panels will give utmost 

consideration to the Precautionary Principle in their deliberations and decisions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Create a World Environmental Organization (WEO) as a partner in tandem with 

the World Trade Organization (WTO).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Levy a small tax (often called the Tobin Tax) of 0.1% on foreign exchange 

transactions, the proceeds -- estimated to be approximately $400 billion per year 

-- to be dedicated primarily to drastically reducing the preventable death toll 

annually of over 10 million children around the world and to the rapid development 

of solar power worldwide.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Demand that the developed countries live up to their already existing commitment 

to provide aid to developing countries in an amount not less than 0.7% of their 

GNP. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Require the IMF and the World Bank to shift their financial aid to developing 

countries from loans to grants to a point where at least one half of the financial 

outlay is in the form of grants.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Make a decision at Johannesberg to convene immediately a special world conference 

to achieve a drastic reduction in the production and sale of arms in and among 

all nations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. Make a decision at Johannesberg to call upon all nations, including the 

government of the United States, to approve the International Criminal Court.</font></p>
