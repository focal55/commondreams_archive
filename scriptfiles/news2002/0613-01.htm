- June 13 - Today the Bush Administration will unveil its regulatory changes to 
a key clean air program, which he promised last year after an intense industry 
lobbying push led by Atlanta-based Southern Company. The move will gut the &quot;New 
Source Review&quot; program, allowing older power plants, refineries and other 
facilities in nearly every state in the nation to operate without modern pollution 
controls, even when they are making significant modifications to the facilities. 
Pollution from old, coal-burning power plants across the nation trigger an estimated 
30,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks annually.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Once again, the Administration 
is giving a massive gift to the energy companies that contributed heavily to the 
Bush campaign,&quot; said Rebecca Stanfield, Clean Air Advocate for U.S. Public 
Interest Research Group (PIRG). &quot;The loss of this program will mean thousands 
of premature deaths per year that could have been prevented,&quot; she continued.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Electric utilities pushed for weakening 
the NSR rules during the 2000 Presidential campaign and in the early months of 
the Bush Administration. Documents have emerged showing that the Cheney Energy 
Task Force met and exchanged memos with Southern Company executives on the issue. 
The Bush energy plan issued last spring included a mandate to review the regulations 
as well as dozens of ongoing enforcement actions. A subsequent comment period 
drew comments from 130,000 concerned citizens opposing any move to weaken clean 
air rules.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is difficult to imagine 
a more aggressive assault on our clean air protections,&quot; said Stanfield. 
&quot;We hope and expect that many of these changes will be ruled illegal, but 
in the meantime a lot of people will suffer unnecessarily from heart and lung 
disease, and a lot of environmental damage will be done.&quot;</font></p>
