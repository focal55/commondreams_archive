<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - January 11 - Human Rights Watch questioned Secretary 

of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's statement today that captured fighters from 

Afghanistan shipped to Cuba were &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; not entitled to 

protection under the Geneva Conventions.  Human Rights Watch also 

criticized the reported use of chain-link cages to confine the 

detainees.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Secretary seems unaware of the requirements of international 

humanitarian law,&quot; said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's 

U.S. Program. &quot;As a party to the Geneva Conventions, the United States 

is required to treat every detained combatant humanely, including 

unlawful combatants. The United States may not pick and choose among 

them to decide who is entitled to decent treatment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">News reports indicate that Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees will be 

confined at Guantanamo Bay in small cages with chain-link sides, 

concrete floors and metal roofs.  The cages will offer scant shelter 

from wind and rain.  Details about sanitary and hygiene facilities are 

not available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not the first time detainees have been held at Guantanamo Bay. 

In 1994, the U.S. government responded to refugee flows from Haiti and 

then Cuba by creating a temporary holding facility at the base.  While 

conditions there were stark and hardly hospitable, the detainees were 

held in  permanent hard-walled shelters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The proposed cages are a scandal,&quot; said Fellner.  &quot;The United States 

should not be transporting detainees to Cuba until it can provide decent 

shelter.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, the laws 

governing the treatment of persons captured during armed conflict. Every 

captured fighter is entitled to humane treatment, understood at a 

minimum to include basic shelter, clothing, food and medical attention. 

In addition, no detainee - even if suspected of war crimes such as the 

murder of civilians - may be subjected to torture, corporal punishment, 

or humiliating or degrading treatment.  If captured fighters are tried 

for crimes, the trials must satisfy certain basic fair trial guarantees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prisoners of war (POWs)  are entitled to further protections, 

commensurate with respect for their military status as soldiers. Indeed, 

the Geneva Conventions provide that prisoners of war must be quartered 

in conditions that meet the same general standards as the quarters 

available to the captor's forces, e.g. the U.S. armed forces. In 

addition, POW's prosecuted for war crimes must be tried by the same 

court under the same rules as the detaining country's armed forces.  In 

the current conflict, an Afghan POW could not be tried b the proposed 

military commissions, although they could be tried by an American 

court-martial.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the Geneva Conventions, captured fighters are considered prisoners 

of war (POWs) if they are members of an adversary state's armed forces 

or are part of an identifiable militia group that abides by the laws of 

war.  Al-Qaeda members, who neither wear identifying insignia nor abide 

by the laws of war, probably would not quality.  Taliban soldiers, as 

the armed forces of Afghanistan, may well be entitled to POW status. If 

there is doubt about a captured fighter's status as a POW, the Geneva 

Conventions require that he be treated as such until a competent 

tribunal determines otherwise.
