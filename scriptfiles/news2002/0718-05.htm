<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- July 18 - A Georgia congressman has drafted legislation that would force taxpayers 
to pay the penalties for Caterpillar and other diesel engine makers who sell dirty 
diesel truck engines that fail to meet federal pollution standards, Clean Air 
Trust reported today. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rep. Mac Collins (R-Ga.) drafted the bill in an apparent response to lobbying 
by trucking interests, which have teamed up with Caterpillar Inc. to lobby Congress 
and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to postpone new pollution standards 
for diesel trucks due to take effect in October of this year. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Caterpillar, unlike some of its rivals, has said it will not meet the standards 
on time. Companies that fail to meet the standards must pay a dirty-air penalty 
to the government, under terms of a 1999 consent agreement that Caterpillar and 
other diesel engine makers signed with the Justice Department. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Collins legislation would require that any dirty-air penalty &quot;be paid 
by the (EPA) Administrator to the purchaser of such engine&quot; manufactured 
by any diesel engine maker that &quot;fails or refuses to comply&quot; with the 
terms of the consent agreement. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In effect, Rep. Collins would make taxpayers foot the bill for dirty 
diesel engines,&quot; said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air 
Trust. &quot;This is a classic case of corporate irresponsibility. Caterpillar 
refused to live up to the terms of its agreement with the government. And now 
Rep. Collins would force the public to subsidize this bad corporate behavior -- 
and breathe dirty air.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell noted that another diesel engine maker, Cummins, has already produced 
diesel engines that meet the new standards. Other diesel engine makers are expected 
to receive federal approval in the near future. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Collins, a former owner and operator of a trucking company now run by his sons, 
is one of the leading congressional recipients of campaign contributions by the 
trucking industry. He received $28,749 in PAC contributions from trucking interests 
in the last two election cycles, according to the Federal Election Commission. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier this week, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman pledged at a congressional 
hearing that she would not reduce proposed penalties for companies such as Caterpillar 
that fail to meet the standards. Whitman made the pledge as a July 16 hearing 
before a House Government Reform subcommittee in response to a question by Rep. 
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On July 10, Collins wrote to Whitman and urged her to postpone the October 
deadline by at least 15 months. Whitman reportedly rejected such a proposal in 
a meeting last week with congressional representatives. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A copy of the draft legislation 
is available from the Clean Air Trust. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></p>
