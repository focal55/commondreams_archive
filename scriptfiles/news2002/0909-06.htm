YORK - September 9 - oices in the Wilderness, a Chicago based campaign to end 

the economic sanctions against Iraq, today announced that members of a forty day 

fast at the UN Headquarters in NY City will break their fast, as planned, on September 

10, at 11:00 a.m. with symbolic servings of embargoed Iraqi dates. The fast was 

undertaken as a nonviolent call for UN members and officials to break ranks with 

policies that have used the UN to wage economic warfare against vulnerable people 

in Iraq. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;In our 48 delegations to Iraq, we have seen mass suffering and death 

imposed on the Iraqi people by our government. As Americans of conscience, we 

must bear some responsibility for the infant mortality and chronic malnutrition 

created by U.S.-led economic sanctions. To bear witness to this suffering, we&#8217;ve 

shared some of the burden of economic sanctions by going without food for 40 days,&#8221; 

said Cey Mooney of Memphis, TN. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of the fast are concerned about the Bush Administration&#8217;s threats 

to wage a massive war against Iraq. While fasting, they have been helping to prepare 

for two projects that will follow the fast: initiation of the Iraq Peace Team 

and coordination of the Mirror of Truth Tour. Two members of the fast, Henry Williamson, 

(Charleston, SC), and Cynthia Banas, (Verona, NY), will prepare to join a team 

planning to take up residence in Iraq, before and during a massive US assault, 

should such an attack occur. Banas and Williamson will depart for Iraq within 

the next several weeks. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cey Mooney, (Memphis, TN), and Mary Ann Muller, (New York, NY) co-coordinators 

of the Mirror of Truth tour, will prepare for the tour&#8217;s September 26 departure 

from NYC. The tour will visit sites in the US where weapons of mass destruction 

are developed, stored, sold and prepared for use, calling on US people to bear 

accountability for weapon proliferation in the US and to create nonviolent alternatives 

to war. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paul Frazier, (Syracuse, NY) and Kathy Kelly (Chicago, IL), will return to 

their homes to continue organizing local nonviolent resistance to US warmaking 

against Iraq. &#8220;Cracks are beginning to open up as we see divergences, both 

internationally and within the Republican party regarding US buildup toward a 

new war,&#8221; said Kelly, who has been to Iraq sixteen times since the Voices 

in the Wilderness campaign began in 1996. &#8220;It&#8217;s another sign that 

the US government is not immovable. We shouldn&#8217;t all throw up our hands 

and feel that all we can do is complain. These divergences are results of pressures 

on the administration. Voices in the Wilderness members urge participation in 

the nationwide Pledge of Resistance campaign which is organizing grassroots groups 

to form affinity groups dedicated to education, outreach and nonviolent resistance 

to escalation of US warfare against Iraq. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of the fast will continue the last week of their vigil across from 

the UN headquarters at First Avenue and 45th Street from 8:00 a.m. &#8211; 1:00 

p.m each weekday through September 10th.</font></p>
