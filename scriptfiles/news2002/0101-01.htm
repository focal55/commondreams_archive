- January 1 - At 8:00am January 1, 2002, ten Oak Ridge Environmental 

Peace Alliance activists entered the Y-12 National Security Complex to 

reclaim the nuclear weapons production facility for peace.   Carrying flags, 

candles and symbols of peace, they made a commitment to work for 

peace and an end to nuclear weapons production in the coming year.  

They were arrested by the Oak Ridge city police, charged with 

misdemeanor trespass and released.   





<p>Below is the statement the group read on the property.



<p>WE RECLAIM THIS LAND FOR PEACE<br>

We are a community of people committed to nonviolence.  We are here at 

the dawn of a New Year bringing candles to light a path toward a world 

free from the threat of nuclear annihilation.  We plant the flags of peace to 

claim the Y-12 National Nuclear Weapons Production Facility (Y-12 

National Security Complex) as a facility for disarmament.



<p>By declaring 2002 a "war year", President Bush has made it clear that US 

terrorism abroad will not stop with Afghanistan. President Bush has 

abandoned the Anti- Ballistic Missile Treaty and the US government 

boycotted the United Nations Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Review 

Conference.



<p>While the President has pledged to substantially cut our nuclear 

stockpiles, the Department of Energy has received billions of tax dollars to 

rebuild the US nuclear weapons complex, in order to increase production 

of nuclear weapons.



<p>We demand that US tax dollars now budgeted for nuclear weapons be 

redirected so that people will have necessary food, decent and affordable 

housing, quality education, adequate medical care and life-giving jobs. 



<p>The threat of annihilation cannot be the basis of any foreign policy.  Peace 

is built by respecting the rights and dignity of all people and acting as a 

partner within the global community. We are making a committed stand 

for peace so that future generations, worldwide, will enjoy freedom of 

speech, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
