- July 16 - The East Timor Action Network (ETAN) along with representatives of 
56 other organizations today called on Congress to renew restrictions on military 
training and weapons sales to Indonesia.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a letter sent to members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, 
the groups warned, &quot;The 'war on terrorism' should not become a vehicle to 
support state-sponsored military terror on civilians in Indonesia.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter urged Congress to renew the &quot;Leahy conditions&quot; restricting 
Indonesia's participation in International Military Training and Education (IMET) 
and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) programs. The letter also argued against 
including Indonesian security forces in the recently-established &quot;Regional 
Counter-terrorism Fellowship&quot; program.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is counter-productive... to withhold prestigious U.S. military training 
in order to encourage military reform and accountability for crimes against humanity 
while offering the same training under a different program,&quot; the letter stated. 
&quot;The Pentagon and others in the Administration have argued that the U.S. 
needs to open channels in order to influence the TNI. We remain unconvinced about 
what influence the Pentagon hopes to achieve, when past experience demonstrates 
that exposure to U.S. military culture has done little or nothing to improve TNI 
practices.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The full text of the letter and its signatories can be found at <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/07letter.htm" target="_new">http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/07letter.htm</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A separate report issued this week by ETAN documented Indonesia's failure to 
comply with the seven &quot;Leahy conditions.&quot; (&quot;Leahy Conditions on 
Restrictions of Military Assistance for Indonesia Have Not Been Met,&quot; <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/07leahy.htm" target="_new">http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/07leahy.htm</a>). 
These conditions, codified in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, call 
for prosecution of those responsible for atrocities in East Timor and Indonesia, 
an end to military support for militia groups, return of refugees, the release 
of political detainees, access to conflict regions by international organizations, 
and accounting for the military's receipts and expenditures.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress first voted to restrict IMET for Indonesia, which brings foreign military 
officers to the U.S. for training, in response to the November 12, 1991 Santa 
Cruz massacre in East Timor. All military ties were severed in September 1999 
as the Indonesian military and its militia proxies razed East Timor following 
its pro-independence vote. Congress first passed the &quot;Leahy conditions&quot; 
in late 1999 and strengthened them last November. The president must certify that 
the Indonesia has met these conditions before regular IMET and FMF can be restored 
for Indonesia.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">House and Senate Appropriations Committees are now considering next fiscal 
year's appropriations bills. Congress has come under increasing pressure from 
the Bush administration to lift restrictions on U.S.-Indonesia military ties.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) advocates for democracy, sustainable 
development, justice and human rights, including women's rights, for the people 
of East Timor. ETAN calls for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against 
humanity that took place in East Timor since 1975. See <a href="http://www.etan.org" target="_new">http://www.etan.org</a>.</i></font></p>
