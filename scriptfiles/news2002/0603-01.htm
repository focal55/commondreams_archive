- June 3 - A national press conference and formal web site launch for UnansweredQuestions.org will be held on Monday, June 10th from 2-5 PM at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of this unprecedented press event and public inquiry is to pose pointed, as yet unanswered, questions regarding the failure of our national security infrastructure, and the response that has sacrificed civil liberties and rewarded failure as opposed to ensuring performance and guaranteeing freedom, now and in the future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UnansweredQuestions.org is being launched by an independent, non-partisan network of citizens concerned about the growing number of issues surrounding September 11th that have yet to be addressed or resolved; and their related public safety and Constitutional implications.  Invited panelists will offer statements, present well-documented research, and ask incisive questions relative to these issues while addressing how citizens can act now to ensure accountability from those in government directly responsible for public safety and upholding the Constitution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conference will be moderated by Catherine Austin Fitts, President of Solari and former Assistant Secretary of Housing during the 1st Bush administration. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Confirmed participants include: <br>

  <br>

Mary Schiavo, Esq., lawyer for 32 passengers' families from all 9/11 hijacked planes, former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation ('90-'96) and author of Flying Safe, Flying Blind. <br>

  <br>

Lorna Brett, Director of Media Relations, Nolan Law Group, representing 9/11 families on United Airlines hijacked planes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ryan Amundson, whose brother Craig was killed at the Pentagon; founder of <a href="http://www.Peaceful%20Tomorrows.org" target="_new">Peaceful Tomorrows.org</a>. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tom Flocco, independent investigative journalist who has researched and written extensively about insider trading in the trading days immediately preceding September 11th. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jared Israel, Investigative Journalist and author of forthcoming book on 9-11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Erlander, Professor of Constitutional Law, William Mitchell University and past President of the National Lawyers Guild. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">J. Michael Springmann, a veteran of 20 years of foreign service, who worked at the Saudi Embassy during a two year period when visas were issued to suspected Saudi hijackers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO), the foremost House proponent of U.S. border security. <br>

  <br>

--Other members of Congress have been invited to participate in the third hour of the conference. <br>

--Further panelists will be announced in the coming week. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organizers maintain that it is the role of informed active citizens to insist upon standards of performance from our public officials in regard to the events surrounding 9-11 and ongoing threats. Organizers are calling for a complete and public investigation of the failures of government agencies (FBI, CIA, INS, FAA) uncovered recently. This, they insist, requires a fuller disclosure of the circumstances surrounding each case in order to effectively address documented misappropriation (or lack of appropriation), incompetence, negligence and possible corruption.  Doing so will ultimately foster an intelligence and national security apparatus that is effectively committed to the public safety and a government worthy of trust and fully accountable to the American people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of radio, television and print press are invited to attend.  There will be ample opportunity for questions and follow-up, and one-on-one interviews with the panelists directly following the event. </font></p>
