<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interview Offer: NCC General Secretary Bob Edgar Supports: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Growing Non-Violent Resistance Movement In Middle East <br>

2. Lifting Embargo, Normalizing Relations With Cuba </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHO: </b><br>

The Rev. Dr. Robert W. Edgar, General Secretary, National 

Council of Churches (NCC), the nation's leading ecumenical 

organization whose 36 Protestant and Orthodox member denominations 

comprise 50 million U.S. Christians. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Topic One: Non-Violent Resistance As Middle East Strategy </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Edgar -- who led an ecumenical church leaders' delegation to 

Israel and Palestine in April -- joins Palestinian Christians 

proposing non-violent resistance as the best strategy for peace in 

the Middle East. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He recalls that only non-violence was able to break the gridlock 

on civil rights in America in the 1960s. A growing consensus for 

that approach in the Middle East seems to be developing among 

people of faith there and in the U.S., Dr. Edgar says. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">See the National Council of Churches' Web site -- specifically, 

<a href="http://www.ncccusa.org/news/02news49.html" target="_new">www.ncccusa.org/news/02news49.html</a> for related documentation: an 

open letter to Yasser Arafat from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and a 

proposal on non-violent resistance from two Palestinian Christians, 

an Episcopalian attorney and a Baptist activist. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Topic Two: Normalizing Relations With Cuba </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NCC favors lifting the U.S. embargo against Cuba and 

normalizing relations between the two countries. Engagement, 

contends Dr. Edgar and the Council, is the best way to improve 

human rights in Cuba. The NCC has maintained a relationship with 

Cuba's churches since before the Revolution. It is an eyewitness to 

the Cuban churches' increasing freedom to worship and provide 

humanitarian service among the Cuban people. The NCC helped 

facilitate former President Jimmy Carter's two-hour meeting with 33 

Cuban church leaders last week (May 15) in Havana. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Edgar -- NCC General Secretary (the top staff post) since 

January 1, 2000 -- served in Congress from 1975 to 1987, 

representing Pennsylvania's Seventh District. From 1990 to 2000 he 

was president of Claremont Theological School, Claremont, Calif. 

He is an ordained elder in the United Methodist Church. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HOW TO CONTACT DR. EDGAR: Call the NCC Communication 

Department, 212-870-2252/2227, or, call Dr. Edgar on his cellphone, 

917-821-0852. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTES: Dr. Edgar is available in Washington, D.C., Monday, May 

20, until Wednesday, May 22. If you get his voicemail, you should 

hear back from him within an hour or two maximum. Dr. Edgar will 

be available in New York City Thursday, May 23, and Friday, May 24. </font></p>
