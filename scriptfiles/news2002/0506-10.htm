 Letter to Senate Calls Push for Fast Track &quot;Backwards-Looking&quot;</font></div>

- May 6 - In a letter to the Senate, 135 groups denounced the Baucus / Grassley Trade Promotion Authority bill, also known as &quot;fast track,&quot; saying that it simply replicates the flawed bill that passed by a single vote margin in the House in December. The letter calls on the Senate to instead support international trade and investment policies that ensure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared, that the environment is protected, and that allow ordinary citizens full access to the decision-making process.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Fast track legislation consistently overlooks the rights of workers in developing countries. In the race toward economic globalization, poor women are at a particular disadvantage,&quot; said National Organization for Women President Kim Gandy. &quot;NOW stands firmly against the Baucus/Grassley bill and any international trade policy that does not protect women workers around the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This fast track bill will lead to trade agreements that could derail a wide range of critical public interest and environmental protections,&quot;said Brent Blackwelder, President of Friends of the Earth. &quot;We stand together with a broad coalition to reject it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The signers represent a remarkably broad coalition representing many of the nation's most influential citizens' groups including women's organizations, unions, consumer groups, family farm advocates, environmentalists, community activists, human rights organizations, and more.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under Fast Track, the Congress gives up its authority to amend trade deals negotiated by the President, and can only vote them up or down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A full copy of the letter and signers is attached.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TRADE ALLIES LETTER TO THE SENATE ON THE BAUCUS-GRASSLEY FAST TRACK BILL</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Senator:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are writing to express our strong opposition to the Baucus/Grassley Trade Promotion Authority bill (also known as fast track).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This legislation is a backwards-looking approach to trade policy, and the Senate should reject it. We believe the United States should show responsible leadership in the global economy by calling for a new generation of international trade and investment policies that will ensure the benefits of globalization are broadly shared, that the environment is protected, and that ordinary citizens can understand and participate in forming the policies that affect their daily lives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This fast track bill accomplishes none of these goals. In nearly all key respects, it simply replicates the flawed bill that passed by a single vote margin in the House of Representatives last December. It also follows the same framework that led to the rejection of fast track legislation by the Congress in 1997 and 1998. We urge you to vote against this bill and reject this overwhelmingly partisan and divisive approach to trade policy. </font></p>
