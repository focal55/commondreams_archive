Rasmussen, who works with the Program on Corporations, Law and Democracy, wrote 

the article "Rethinking the Corporation." She said today: "The legislation signed 

by Mr. Bush today is a quickly-devised effort to send a message that the people 

are 'winning,' when, in fact, nothing of the sort has happened.... A law establishing 

oversight and imposing a few penalties we are told will set things right and get 

corporations in line, but will in fact leave the giant corporations and their 

complicit governments to proceed with business as usual. Such speedy acting is 

intended to divert us from the fundamental question of who governs in this country.... 

We need to be rewriting corporate law in all 50 states and engaging in the struggle 

to build democratic institutions that put the people in charge."</p> </font>

Co-author of "Enron's Pawns: How Public Institutions Bankrolled Enron's Globalization 

Game," Wysham is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and the director 

of the Sustainable Energy and Economy Network. She said today: "Long before Enron's 

tricks came to light in the U.S., the company was infamous for even more egregious 

practices in the developing world.... Our research has uncovered that 21 agencies 

representing the U.S. government, multilateral development banks, and other national 

governments helped leverage Enron's global reach with $7.2 billion in public financing 

approved for 38 projects in 29 countries. Enron's overseas operations rewarded 

shareholders temporarily, but often punished the people and governments of foreign 

countries with price hikes and blackouts worse than what California suffered in 

2001, causing social unrest and riots that were sometimes brutally repressed. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. government and other public agencies continued to advocate 

on Enron's behalf, threatening poor countries -- for example Mozambique was threatened 

with an end to aid if it did not accept Enron's bid on a natural gas field. Only 

when Enron's scandals began to affect Americans did these officials and institutions 

hold the corporation at arm's length."</p> </font>

Michael Powell, chairman of the FCC, testified before the Senate on Tuesday. Chester 

is executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy and co-author of the 

recent article "A 12-Step Program for Media Democracy." Chester said today: "The 

FCC's recently released five-year plan does not even mention the 'public interest' 

-- something that should be central to its role."</p></i></p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center">###</p>
