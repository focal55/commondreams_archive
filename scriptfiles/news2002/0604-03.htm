<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 4 - Today Ralph Nader and 

CPTech Director James Love wrote OMB Director Mitch Daniels to ask 

the federal government to use its power as a big consumer to 

address competition issues in the market for PC client software. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are some of the practices Nader and Love want OMB to 

examine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- OMB is asked to provide information on federal expenditures 

for Microsoft products, determine if a software &quot;monoculture&quot; makes 

the federal government more vulnerable to computer viruses or 

unauthorized access to federal computers, and to consider a number 

of strategies to use the US government's purchasing power to 

promote competition and make Microsoft behave. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- OMB is asked to consider if Microsoft should be required (as 

a matter of procurement policy) to fully disclose the file formats 

of its office productivity and multimedia programs, so that the 

data created in such programs could be reliably read by 

non-Microsoft software. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- OMB is asked to consider if it should place a cap of the 

market share for any one vender of PC client software, and have the 

size of the cap depend upon Microsoft's willingness to open up its 

interface information, or port its MS Office products to additional 

platforms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- OMB is also asked to consider if it would be more efficient 

to buy code for office productivity products (and release into the 

public domain), rather than spend billions to lease software. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ralph Nader said, &quot;The federal government spends billions of 

dollars on software purchases from one company that is continually 

raising prices, making its products incompatible with previous 

versions in order to Force upgrades, deliberately creating 

interoperability problems with would-be competitors, and is well 

known for engaging in many other anticompetitive practices. Would 

a business that was spending this much money be such a passive 

consumer? &quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">James Love said, &quot;The U.S. government could easily solve all of 

its concerns over the Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct by being 

a smarter consumer. Taxpayers are spending millions to restrain 

Microsoft's monopoly, and billions to support the Microsoft 

monopoly. There needs to be a more coherent strategy. &quot; </font></p>
