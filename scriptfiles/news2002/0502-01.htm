<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COLUMBUS, OHIO - May 2 - On Wednesday morning, May 1, ten Colombia solidarity 

activists from Ohio appeared in Franklin County Municipal Court before 

Judge James Green.  After a night in the county jail, all were arraigned on 

charges of having criminally trespassed and resisted arrest in Sen. Mike 

DeWine's Columbus office on Tuesday afternoon. All pled not guilty, and 

their release is pending the posting of bonds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ten represent civic groups throughout Ohio that have tried for two 

years to meet directly with DeWine -- always unsuccessfully. On Tuesday 

they insisted, as constituents, on a definite date for a meeting with the 

senator -- and they refused to leave his office without the promise of a 

timely appointment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sen. DeWine helped to craft &quot;Plan Colombia&quot; for the Clinton 

Administration, which provided $1.3 billion in mostly military aid to 

Colombia. Currently he supports the Bush Administration's efforts to 

further increase military aid, as well as efforts to chemically eradicate 

coca crops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protesters maintain that evidence on the ground in Colombia proves 

that US policies are killing and displacing rural civilian populations, 

many of whom are living over vast and coveted oil reserves. As newly 

arraigned John Ewers stated before entering DeWine's office on Tuesday, &quot;Sen. DeWine cares a lot about keeping the children of Ohio healthy. We 

insist that he care as much about the children of Colombia.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plan Colombia was originally supposed to provide money to fight the &quot;drug 

war&quot; -- to stop Colombian farmers from growing coca plants -- by providing 

military aid to a government that has ties to human-rights abusing 

paramilitary groups.  To the Bush administration, Colombia now falls under 

the &quot;counterterrorism&quot; banner.  Currently there is a bill pending in 

congress that would provide another $98 million not specifically targeted 

at stopping the drug war; the money is instead to be used for a number of 

counterinsurgency tactics including the guarding of an Oxidental Oil 

pipeline that is frequently broken by a guerilla group because it goes 

straight through the land of the indigenous U'Wa people.</font></p>
