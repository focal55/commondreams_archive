<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NORTHAMPTON, 

MA - July 25 - Writing on behalf of victims of past police lawlessness, the Greensboro 

Justice Fund of Northampton, MA, contacted Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the 

Senate Judiciary Committee, to oppose Attorney General Ashcroft&#8217;s lifting 

of Senate-imposed restrictions on the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those restrictions 

have, since 1976 until this year, banned the Bureau&#8217;s involvement in political 

spying, disruption, and violence.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Senate Judiciary Committee 

is scheduled on Thursday to begin hearings on Justice Department policies in the 

wake of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Since last fall, 

Attorney General Ashcroft has voided Justice Department Guidelines previously 

prohibiting involvement in the widely-condemned political surveillance activities 

of its CounterIntelligence Program or COINTELPRO.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From Senate hearings conducted 

by Senator Frank Church in 1976 and from several successful lawsuits by civil 

rights activists, families of slain Black Panther Party members, and the Socialist 

Workers Party, was drawn a picture of an FBI run amok, secretly fomenting violence, 

dissent and fear among the political enemies of former FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover. 

Because of the widespread charges of violation of Constitutional rights associated 

with the Program, COINTELPRO excesses have been banned by the Justice Department 

Guidelines for almost twenty-five years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However those guidelines 

did not apply to local police or other federal agencies, such as the Bureau of 

Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, both implicated in the November 3, 1979 murders 

by Ku Klux Klansmen and American Nazi Party members of trade union and community 

activists in Greensboro, North Carolina. The 1985 Greensboro Civil Rights Suit 

on behalf of the injured and families of those killed resulted in liability assigned 

to two Greensboro policemen, an informant who recruited, organized and led the 

killers, and five Klan and Nazi shooters. The City of Greensboro paid the judgment, 

providing seed money for foundation work by the Greensboro Justice Fund to aid 

other organizers in the South working for racial and economic justice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on the experience 

of the victims with unlawful political surveillance and informant activity leading 

to the Massacre, the Greensboro Justice Fund and former plaintiffs of the Greensboro 

Civil Rights Suit asked the Judiciary Committee to rein in the Ashcroft Justice 

Department from again allowing the FBI to spy upon and disrupt legitimate organizing. 

&#8220;The Greensboro Massacre is a possible template for FBI activity in the 

future as the Church Guidelines are lifted. And the plan to recruit literally 

millions of informants, paid and unpaid, through Operation TIPS, threatens not 

only Big Brother surveillance of &#8216;unusual&#8217; lawful activity, but the 

potential for unleashing those informants who may, as did (the Klan informant 

in Greensboro), perform illegal activities &#8211; break-ins, provocation, assault 

and murder &#8211; against the FBI&#8217;s and the informants&#8217; targets.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, the Greensboro Justice Fund 

decried the Justice Department&#8217;s limiting of access to information about 

federal government activities by its new policy of denying, a priori, requests 

under the Freedom of Information Act. &#8220;The access by citizens to information 

about their government, including information about illegal and unconstitutional 

activities by law enforcement against those it is designated to protect, is a 

strong deterrent to the kind of abuses inflicted by the pre-1976 FBI and the Greensboro 

Police and BATF in the Greensboro Massacre.&#8221;</font> </p>
