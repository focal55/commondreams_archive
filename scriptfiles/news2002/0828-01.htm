<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - August 26 

- In response to a call from U.S. peace and human rights organizations, 

communities throughout the United States and the world are planning &#8220;peace 

events&#8221; to honor the people who died on Sept. 11, 2001. The event titles 

range from &#8220;work a day for peace&#8221; to &#8220;our grief is not a cry 

for war&#8221; to&#8220;from ground zero to common ground,&#8221; but what ties 

them together is their theme: working for a world without terrorism and war.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The response to this idea has been overwhelming, in large part as a 

response to President Bush&#8217;s call for an attack of Iraq&#8221; said Medea 

Benjamin, founding director of San Francisco&#8217;s Global Exchange and a founder 

of United for Peace, the coalition of groups that put out the call for peace events. 

&#8220;In over 100 U.S. cities, as well as nearly a dozen foreign countries, people 

are honoring those who died on September 11 by calling for no more innocent victims.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The astounding array of events are listed on the website www.unitedforpeace.org. 

They include overnight vigils, peace walks, fasts, concerts, art projects, donating 

the day&#8217;s wages to peace groups, and teach-ins about peace issues. The events 

are taking place from the big cities of New York and Los Angeles to the smaller 

towns of Boise, Idaho and Hood River, Oregon. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The explosion of peace organizing around September 11 marks the beginning of 

a new peace movement whose immediate goal is to stop the Bush Administration from 

going to war with Iraq. &#8220;It is possible to stop this war,&#8221; said Lynate 

Pettengil, a peace activist in Lawrence, Kansas. &#8220;If you and I stand up 

and let it be known that our country should not go to war with Iraq, and we join 

together with thousands of other women, men and children throughout the U.S. with 

this message, we will be heard.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Endorsers of United for Peace include international peace leaders like Arun 

Gandhi, the grandson of Mahatama Gandhi, and Nobel Peace Laureate and former President 

of Costa Rica Oscar Arias. &#8220;Many people who have lost loved ones to violence 

have come to the realization that only by planting the seeds of peace will their 

loss not have been in vain,&#8221; says Arias. United for Peace is also endorsed 

by September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, the National Coalition 

for Peace and Justice, Fellowship of Reconciliation, American Friends Service 

Committee, Peace Action, Veterans for Peace, and Global Exchange.</font></p>
