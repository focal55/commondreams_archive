- July 30 - Polymer clays contain chemicals that may threaten children's health, 

according to a new study released today by the Public Interest Research Groups 

(PIRGs). Hidden Hazards: Health Impacts of Toxins in Polymer Clays documents laboratory 

tests indicating that children using polymer clays marketed under the brand names 

Sculpey, Fimo, and Cernit can be exposed to high levels of phthalates (pronounced 

&quot;tha-lates&quot;), chemicals associated with reproductive disorders, birth 

deformities, and other health effects. The clays are highly popular at schools, 

child care centers, and arts centers.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Polymer clays contain hidden hazards that may harm children's health 

even when are used as directed on the package,&quot; said Curt McCormack, director 

of advocacy for Vermont PIRG, which produced the study. &quot;These products show 

the failure of our regulatory systems - playing with the clays can result in exposure 

levels many times higher than regulations for situations like drinking water or 

workplace exposures.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Phthalates are petroleum derivatives used to soften plastics, and also found 

in cosmetics, shampoo, hair spray, and other products. Lab research shows that 

various phthalate esters can reduce fertility, cause abnormal reproductive problems 

in male offspring, such as testicular atrophy, and give rise to liver and thyroid 

damage. Some occupational evidence links phthalate exposure to high rates of miscarriage 

in female workers, and long-term nerve damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the report, the clays tested contained up to 14% phthalates by 

weight. Among the phthalate compounds identified were Di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), 

Benzyl Butyl phthalate (BBP), Di-n-Hexyl phthalate (DnHP) and Di (ethyl hexyl) 

terphthalate (DEHT). Five other phthalate esters were located in the products 

but the identity of these compounds was not determined in the research.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DnOP and DnHP are associated with reproductive damage, liver and thyroid damage. 

BBP is associated with reproductive effects, birth deformities, nerve damage and 

is a suspected EPA carcinogen in animals. DEHT is a compound thought to be used 

in relatively low volumes, about which little is known.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Phthalate compounds clearly have the potential to damage health in developing 

organisms,&quot; said U.S. PIRG environmental health advocate Jeremiah Baumann. 

&quot;There is no excuse for a regulatory system that allows children's products 

to contain these chemical in unrestricted amounts and no excuse for manufacturers' 

misleading labeling these clays as 'non-toxic.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report criticized the clays' 'non-toxic' certification, given by the Arts 

and Creative Materials Institute (ACMI), comprised of manufacturers of art and 

crafts material manufacturers. The ACMI did not consider the full range of chemicals 

that were found in the report when designating the clays as 'non-toxic'.<br>

The report points out the broader problem that the regulation of toxic chemicals 

in U.S. federal law to protect humans from exposure to toxic chemicals is grossly 

inadequate. Thousands of industrial chemicals were not tested before going on 

the market, and federal law hampers regulators' ability to restrict the use of 

known hazardous chemicals.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Many people assume that just because a product is on the market it has 

been tested and is safe,&quot; said McCormack. &quot;This is wrong. Many consumer 

products contain chemicals known to have toxic effect or about which we know very 

little.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A federal panel reviewing phthalates' effects on human reproduction decided 

that even though BBP, DnOP and DnHP showed associations with reproductive damage, 

human health risks were low because exposures were assumed to be minimal. As a 

result, they determined that these chemicals were of minor consequence if used 

in consumer products. However, the PIRG report indicates that the use of even 

small amounts of polymer clay could expose children to levels of phthalates much 

higher than the federal panel predicted as the average for adults, and calls into 

question their assumptions that the chemicals are insignificant. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to exposing children to phthalates, polymer clays can release a 

highly toxic hydrochloric acid gas when overheated in the oven. The fumes are 

noxious, have a strong smell, and are emitted when the oven temperature is set 

too high. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The State PIRGs urged the Consumer Product Safety Commission to place a moratorium 

on the sale of polymer clay products until and unless their potential health effects 

are fully investigated and phthalate exposure eliminated. They called on manufacturers 

to drop their claims of nontoxic status for the clays and to immediately reformulate 

them to eliminate phthalate exposure. The report authors also advised parents 

to prevent children's exposure to these clays until the products are made safe.</font></p>
