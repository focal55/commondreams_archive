DE JANEIRO - September 5 - Greenpeace activists hung the banner &quot;RIO+10 = 

2nd CHANCE?&quot; across the arms of the Christ the Redeemer (on Corcovado) in 

Rio de Janeiro today to protest against world leaders&#8217; failure to secure 

the future of the planet at the Earth Summit in Johannesburg that ended yesterday, 

September 4, 2002. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The outcome of the energy negotiations epitomizes the failure of world 

governments to ensure a clean and sustainable future for the generations to come. 

Government leaders did nothing to ensure that two billion people currently living 

without electricity will soon have access to clean, renewable energy,&quot; said 

Marcelo Furtado, of Greenpeace. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposal set forth in Rio, ten years ago, which called for a target of 

10 percent renewables by 2010, was blocked by the United States, Japan and the 

member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 

Instead, the final text coming out of the WSSD in Johannesburg, contains no targets 

or timetables for the implementation of clean energy which is instrumental in 

protecting the climate. Additionally, the text promotes large-scale hydro projects 

and transference of fossil fuel technologies to developing countries, and does 

not exclude the possibility of nuclear energy projects.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Humanity cannot remain silent after the failure of Rio+10. We should 

all question the governments that killed Brazil&#8217;s proposal as well as the 

targets and timelines for implementation of clean, renewable energy. Powerful 

oil exporters and consumers are frying our future and the oil industry is behind 

it, using greenwashing to hide its dirty and extremely dangerous games,&quot; 

said Frank Guggenheim, Executive Director of Greenpeace Brazil. &quot;What&#8217;s 

worse, governments are letting them get away with it and globally subsidize the 

fossil fuel and nuclear industries to the tune of 250-300 billion U.S. dollars 

per year 2.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of today&#8217;s protests, Greenpeace activists will deliver the &quot;mortal=remains&quot; 

of the Johannesburg Earth Summit to those responsible for the failure of the Earth 

Summit: the world's multinational fossil fuel corporations. Ironically, they are 

all gathered at the World Petroleum Congress in Rio, the host city to the first 

Earth Summit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greenpeace will continue to press world governments to create the necessary 

conditions to implement clean and sustainable energy and to guarantee a safe future, 

free from environmental devastation. </font></p>
