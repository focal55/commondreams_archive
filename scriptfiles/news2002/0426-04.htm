- April 26 - A shooting today that

left at least 18 dead at a school in Erfurt, Germany evoked

memories of the Columbine massacre three years ago, and was a

chilling demonstration of the carnage caused by the flood of

illegal weapons.

<p>Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun

Violence, had this to say: "Our condolences go to the victims of

today's shooting in Germany. Americans -- with the impact of

Columbine still emblazoned on our national conscience -- know all

too well the pain that the German people are going through today.

No community, in no nation anywhere in the world, should have to

endure such gruesome acts of violence and death.

<p>"While we do not yet know how the gunman obtained his weapon,

the gun lobby likely will use today's shooting to say that gun laws

do not work -- that Germany's strict gun laws failed to prevent

this massacre. But the real issue here is the illegal gun market,

fueled by the smuggling of weapons from countries with weak gun

laws -- such as Eastern European and Balkan nations as reported in

press accounts today -- into countries with tough laws like

Germany.

<p>"Today's tragedy in Germany is another wake-up call for America,

which has the same illegal gun trafficking problem between states

that Germany has with other nations. Study after study has shown

the effectiveness of state laws at stopping illegal gun

transactions. But those laws are undermined when guns are

illegally trafficked into states with tough gun laws from states

with weak gun laws. What is needed is a national policy -- such as

extending Brady background checks to all gun sales, handgun

licensing, and handgun registration -- to standardize the crazy

patchwork of state laws, and to stop illegal gun trafficking."
