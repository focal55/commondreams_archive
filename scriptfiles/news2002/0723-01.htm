- July 23 - The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) today strongly condemned 

Israel's use of American taxpayer-supplied weapons to massacre at least 11 Palestinians, 

including women and children, in an attack on a residential building in the Gaza 

Strip.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The latest list of dead released by a nearby hospital included two babies ages 

18 and 2 months, five children ages 3-5, an 11-year-old and three adults. Israel 

used an American-made F-16 fighter plane to launch the missile that struck the 

building.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The blood of these innocent children is on the hands of those in America's 

pro-Israel lobby who use their influence to promote congressional and administration 

policies that provide American tax dollars and tacit support for such attacks,&quot; 

said CAIR Board Chairman Omar Ahmad. He said the attack was a violation of the 

U.S. Arms Export Control Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Terrorism is defined as the use of violence against civilians to achieve 

political goals. This premeditated attack on a civilian building in the dead of 

night is a prime example of state-sponsored terrorism. If our government fails 

to condemn this massacre, all the official rhetoric about 'zero-tolerance' for 

terrorism will ring hollow around the Muslim world. There should be one standard 

for defining terrorism, not one for Israel and one for the rest of the world,&quot; 

said Ahmad.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He added that the recent administration shift away from an even-handed Middle 

East policy to one that bows to Israeli dictates was obviously viewed as a green-light 

for the attack. Ahmad also called on American Jewish groups to condemn the attack 

in the same way that American Muslim organizations have condemned other acts of 

terrorism.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also condemned the attack, 

saying: &quot;Israel has the legal and moral responsibility to take all measures 

to avoid the loss of innocent life; it clearly failed to do so in using a missile 

against an apartment building...The secretary-general calls on the government 

of Israel to halt such actions and to conduct itself in a manner that is fully 

consistent with international humanitarian law.&quot;</font></p>
