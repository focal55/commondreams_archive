<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BREA, CA - May 20 -  Worker shareholders at Unocal Corporation's (NYSE:UCL) annual meeting today challenged the company's reported plans to increase its investment in Burma, and announced new investor support for a resolution on worker rights shareholders voted on at the meeting. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter hand-delivered to company chairman and CEO Charles Williamson, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka asked him to explain to shareholders how Unocal does not violate U.S. government sanctions against new investment in Burma in light of a recent press report indicating that Unocal intends to pursue a new Burma-India gas pipeline. In addition, documents available on Unocal's web site show a proposed new pipeline linking the company's Burmese offshore gas fields to the Burmese capital Rangoon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Despite the recent release of Burmese democracy leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, we think that this is not the time to make plans for business expansions in Burma,&quot; said Trumka. &quot;Ms. Suu Kyi reiterated her stance opposing foreign investments after her house arrest ended this month. We ask Unocal to disclose to shareholders any expansion plans it has for its Burma operations in light of the high risks in this country.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A May 14 report from World Markets Analysis stated that Unocal, Brown &amp; Root, and the Indian government are believed to have conducted initial feasibility studies to construct a 1,100 km undersea gas pipeline from Burma to India. Unocal and the Burmese military dictatorship have been looking to find new markets for Burmese gas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution offered at the meeting urges the board of directors to adopt and implement a company-wide employee policy based on the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including bans on child and forced labor. The Longview Collective Investment Fund of the Amalgamated Bank and Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical &amp; Energy Workers International Union (PACE) are the sponsors of the proposal. A similar proposal submitted at last year's Unocal annual meeting received approximately 23 percent of the vote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investors are increasingly critical of Unocal's global operations. Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS), the leading independent proxy advisory firm in the United States, has recommended that Unocal shareholders vote in favor of a proposal concerning worker rights. Several institutional investors have already come out in favor of this proposal, including the New York City Employees' Retirement System, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, the UK-based Cooperative Insurance Society and Walden Asset Management (a division of U.S. Trust Company of Boston) with combined total assets of more than $198 billion. They joined the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), one of the world's largest pension funds with assets totaling $156 billion, which had already announced its support for the shareholder proposal. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Investors are increasingly concerned that workplace and human rights violations will impact Unocal's bottom line,&quot; said ICEM North America Regional Coordinator Kenneth Zinn. &quot;Worker shareholders and institutional investors alike care that Unocal adopt best practices in its worldwide operations and minimize unnecessary risk to shareholders.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrators outside today's shareholders meeting protested against Unocal's participation in a $1.2 billion natural gas joint venture with a firm owned by the Burmese military dictatorship that has been widely condemned for its systematic use of forced labor and other human rights abuses. In addition, Unocal's investments in Burma have exposed the company to significant potential liabilities resulting from two lawsuits filed by Burmese refugees in U.S. courts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We are extremely concerned about Unocal's business operations in countries with poor human rights records,&quot; said James Norris, president of PACE Local 8-675, who is a former Unocal refinery employee. &quot;In Burma, for example, thousands of Burmese citizens have been pressed into forced-labor gangs, up to a third of Burmese children work instead of attend school, and trade unions are banned,&quot; Norris continued. &quot;Unocal should stop propping up the Burmese dictatorship with its investments and start improving its image.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The AFL-CIO represents 13 million working men and women who participate in the capital markets as investors through defined benefit and defined contribution plans, as well as through mutual funds and individual accounts. The ICEM is a global trade union federation representing 20 million workers in 110 nations, including more than nine million energy workers. </font></p>
