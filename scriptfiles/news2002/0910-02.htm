- September 10 - The Green Party of the United States marked the anniversary of 

the September 11 attacks with a call for a new democratic direction in U.S. policy. 

Candidates and activists of America's only growing political party support a new 

program based on adherence to U.S. and international laws, respect for civil liberties, 

sound environmental policy, economic security, and peacemaking: </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) BRING JUSTICE TO THE PERPETRATORS OF SEPTEMBER 11. &quot;We're concerned 

that the perpetrators of the attacks remain at large and that the Bush administration 

has made no effort to pursue legal means to bring them to justice,&quot; said 

Ted Glick, New Jersey Green candidate for the U.S. Senate. &quot;We join Greens 

around the world in supporting the indictment, capture, and prosecution of those 

responsible for the September 11 attacks.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT SEPTEMBER 11 TRUTH COMMISSION. &quot;Greens are 

disappointed that Congress has failed to establish a public and independent truth 

commission to investigate the origins and consequences of the September 11 attacks,&quot; 

said Ben Manski, Wisconsin Green and member of the party's national steering committee. 

&quot;Greens, along with other members of the 9/11 Emergency National Network 

and many other Americans, have proposed the immediate establishment of such a 

commission, charged with calm, determined, and open investigation of the facts 

related to the historic events which form the basis of U.S. foreign and domestic 

policy today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) INVEST IN ECONOMIC SECURITY. The Green Party of the United States calls 

for the adoption of a long-term program for domestic security that (a) replaces 

oil dependence with reliance on renewable energy and (b) subordinates the corporation 

beneath democratic rule. &quot;Unchecked corporate power and dependence on oil 

represent two of the greatest threats to the security of the United States,&quot; 

said Charles Laws, Green candidate for Governor of Nevada. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4) END SABRE-RATTLING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Greens warn that the Bush Administration's 

policy of military aggression in the Middle East undermines any hope of achieving 

a peaceful resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and will further cause 

loss of life and instability in the region. &quot;We strongly oppose the ongoing 

sanctions and military attacks on Iraq which have cost the lives of hundreds of 

thousands of innocent civilians; we likewise oppose the threatened invasion of 

Iraq,&quot; said Donna Warren, Green candidate for Lieutenant Governor of California. 

&quot;The U.S. needs a Department of Peace. Greens demand a Middle East policy 

that aims for a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(5) EXPAND PROTECTIONS FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES. &quot;It's time to renew our commitment 

to the Bill of Rights and to expand protections for civil liberties,&quot; said 

Dr. Jonathan Farley, Green congressional candidate from Tennessee. &quot;The Green 

Party of the United States and Green congressional candidates demand that Congress 

repeal the unpatriotic USA PATRIOT Act. We demand that our Congress and President 

defend freedom of speech, religion, person, and association, and support new civil 

rights protections for workers on the job, immigrants, people of all sexualities, 

women, people of color, people with disabilities, and for all others suffering 

the effects of discrimination.&quot; (Dr. Farley will be interviewed by the BBC 

live from New York on September 11 in a discussion of the war on terror.)</font></p>
