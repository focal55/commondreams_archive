Undermines Church-State Separation, Says AU<br>

- April 29 - The National Day of Prayer (NDP) is a federally mandated religious observance that undermines the core of the First Amendment, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is wholly inconsistent with the principles of the First Amendment for the government to set aside a special 'prayer day' for the nation,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;Americans don't need official instruction from politicians on when and how to pray.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NDP was established as an annual event by an act of Congress in 1952. Originally a &quot;floating holiday,&quot; the NDP was officially designated the first Thursday in May when Congress amended the law in 1988.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This year's NDP features an official &quot;prayer for America,&quot; written by United States Senate Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie, a taxpayer-financed minister for the Senate. Ogilvie's prayer, which Religious Right activists are urging all Americans to recite at 12 noon on May 2, was written to &quot;acknowledge [God's] sovereignty.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prayer asks God to grant &quot;supernatural powers&quot; to the president and Congress, and commits the nation &quot;to be faithful to You as Sovereign of our land and as our personal Lord and Savior.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We rededicate ourselves to be one nation under You,&quot; Ogilvie's prayer says. &quot;In You we trust. We reaffirm our accountability to You, to the absolutes of Your Commandments, and to justice in our society.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For AU's Lynn, it's troubling that a chaplain, whose salary is financed by taxpayers, would presume to write official prayers for America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's bad enough that the government is telling people when to pray,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;It's even worse when a publicly-funded minister is telling us what to pray. For anyone who takes the First Amendment seriously, this fusion of religion and government is indefensible.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Day of Prayer has been effectively taken over by the Religious Right in recent years. Most NDP events are coordinated by the National Day of Prayer Task Force, a private group headed by Shirley Dobson, wife of Focus on the Family founder and Religious Right leader James Dobson. The task force urges prayer events in government facilities and schools.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As has been the case in recent years, the Religious Right is using the annual observance to undermine the principle of church-state separation. This year, for example, the NDP Task Force is using materials from Jay Sekulow, head of TV preacher Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice, to argue that government promotion of religion is legally permissible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The NDP Task Force's high-profile Washington, D.C., event, to be held in a congressional office building, will give moralist and former Reagan administration Education Secretary Bill Bennett a chance to address the issue of education in America. Bennett, a long-time foe of public education, is almost certain to use the opportunity to levy an attack on the nation's public schools.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the NDP is being positioned as a special day, but only for those who agree with the Religious Right's faith. While NDP Task Force materials on one page say, &quot;The National Day of Prayer belongs to all Americans,&quot; on another page the group says its events, hosted across the country, are exclusively for Christians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU's Lynn noted that this year's NDP has been given a theme by the NDP Task Force: &quot;America United Under God.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans and their government are united, but under the Constitution, not some kind of government-imposed religion,&quot; Lynn concluded. &quot;On May 2, people should pray, or not pray, based on their beliefs. It simply isn't any of the government's business.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn also pointed out that key Founding Fathers such as James Madison and Thomas Jefferson thought official prayer day proclamations were violations of the constitutional separation of church and state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Madison, the &quot;Father of the Constitution,&quot; said such proclamations are inappropriate. &quot;They seem to imply and certainly nourish the erroneous idea of a national religion,&quot; Madison wrote in a collection of writings referred to as the &quot;Detached Memoranda.&quot; Jefferson made similar arguments and refused to issue prayer proclamations during his presidency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
