FRANCISCO/SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS - July 23 - CorpWatch announced today that 

it had completed its search for a new executive director. Maria Elena Martinez, 

a Mexican activist and researcher will join the organization as Executive Director 

as of October 1st. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We conducted a thorough search and we found the best candidate,&#8221; 

said CorpWatch board chair Mele Lau Smith. &#8220;We are very excited that Maria 

Elena is coming on board. She brings with her a diverse set of skills and experiences 

that will enrich the organization tremendously.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the last several years Ms. Martinez, who holds a PhD from the University 

of California at Berkeley, has been the Director of Desarollo Alternativo, a Mexican 

non-profit working on alternatives to corporate globalization for rural areas. 

She has also been a visiting scholar at the CIESAS and PROIMMSE social science 

research institutes in Chiapas, Mexico, and was formerly the Mexico Program Coordinator 

at Food First/The Institute for Food and Development Policy, in Oakland, California. 

She was also co-founder of the Chiapas Support Committee and the Comit&eacute; 

Emiliano Zapata solidarity committees in the USA.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;At a moment when corporate-globalization continues to trample people&#8217;s 

rights in the United States, Mexico and around the world,&#8221; said Ms. Martinez, 

&#8220;I look forward to the challenge and honor of working with an organization 

that plays a leadership role in confronting the globalization paradigm and promoting 

alternatives to it.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CorpWatch&#8217;s founder and outgoing Executive Director, Joshua Karliner 

spoke of the importance of Ms. Martinez joining CorpWatch. &#8220;The organization 

has grown to the point where it is attracting highly talented and experienced 

people such as Maria Elena. This is good for us, and it&#8217;s good for the movement,&#8221; 

said Karliner. &#8220;I am very much looking forward working with Maria Elena 

to assure a smooth transition, and then to collaborating and working closely with 

her and the rest of the CorpWatch team well into the future.&#8221;</font></p>
