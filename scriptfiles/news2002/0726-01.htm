- July 26 - Starting this weekend Sec. of State Colin Powell will visit Pakistan, 

India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines to bolster regional support 

for America's war on terrorism. But he will also be confronted with more pressing 

issues that threaten the peace and stability of the region: the ongoing conflict 

in Kashmir; ethnic and religious conflict in Indonesia and continuing human rights 

abuses by the Indonesian armed forces; political repression in Malaysia; and increasingly 

popular unrest over the American military presence in the Philippines. Coupled 

with vast social and economic inequalities in the region, can the U.S. afford 

to solely concentrate on the terrorist threat in Asia? The following experts are 

available for comment:</font>

&quot;Sec. of State Powell faces the challenge of demonstrating the State Department's 

relevance in the region, as it has been largely marginalized by the Pentagon as 

the primary agency driving the Bush administration's policy in Asia. While the 

Pentagon is expanding a web of military aid and alliances under the guise of fighting 

the war on terrorism, the security challenges facing the U.S. in Asia are not 

military. Widespread economic and political grievances in Asia require a focus 

on strengthening democratic governance and fighting poverty. Powell's predicament 

is how to bring diplomacy back into U.S. foreign policy with an administration 

committed to militarizing U.S. policy in Asia.&quot;</font></p>

&quot;If Sec. of State Powell is serious about opposing terrorism, he must forcefully 

speak out for genuine military reform, democratization, and justice for crimes 

against humanity committed by the Indonesian military (TNI) in East Timor and 

Indonesia. Ongoing abuses against civilians in Aceh and West Papua must end, as 

well as assistance to radical Islamic groups such as Laskar Jihad. Powell must 

make clear that the Senate Appropriations Committee's decision to restore IMET 

military training to the TNI is not an endorsement as business-as-usual in Indonesia.&quot;</font></p>

&quot;Sec. of State Powell will find he will have to smooth ruffled feathers in 

India. There is growing impatience with Pakistan's inability or unwillingness 

to stop the infiltration of Islamic guerrillas into Kashmir. Many also felt that 

the American decision to pull out its citizens for fear of nuclear war was yet 

another sanction against India. Powell will need to reassure India that progress 

towards a stronger bilateral relationship is not in danger, and the U.S. needs 

to realize that there are people in New Delhi waiting to derail it. While Powell 

has to get tougher with the Pakistanis over infiltration, he also has to get Indians 

to think more creatively over Kashmir.&quot;</font></p>
