- May 28 - As Title IX turns 30 this 

June, the National Women's Law Center provides this briefing to 

help explain this important civil rights law. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is the federal law 

that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Title IX says: 

&quot;No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be 

excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be 

subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity 

receiving Federal financial assistance.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Title IX is best known for creating more opportunities for women 

and girls to play sports. Title IX requires schools and colleges 

receiving federal funds to give women and girls an equal chance to 

play sports and to treat men and women equally when it comes to 

athletic scholarships and other benefits like equipment, coaching 

and facilities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But Title IX does not apply ONLY to athletics. This law 

prohibits sex discrimination in ALL aspects of education, including 

career and vocational programs, admissions and employment policies, 

standardized testing, and treatment of pregnant and parenting 

teens. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since Title IX, the number of male AND female student athletes 

has greatly increased. The number of male college athletes has 

increased from 170,384 in 1972 to 208,866 in 2001; the number of 

female college athletes has increased from 31,852 in 1972 to 

150,916 -- almost a five-fold increase. The number of high school 

girls playing competitive sports has increased from fewer than 

300,000 before Title IX to 2.78 million in 2001. This shows that 

women's -- and men's -- interest in sports grows with their 

increased opportunities to play them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even so, Title IX's role in athletics is not yet finished. 

Resources for women's athletic programs continue to lag behind 

men's. While women are 53 percent of the student body at Division 

I colleges, they are only 41 percent of the athletes, receive only 

32 percent of recruiting dollars and get only 36 percent of overall 

athletic operating budgets. At the high school level, the 

inequitable treatment, budgets and equipment girls receive can be 

far worse. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are important things that Title IX does not do. It does 

not mandate &quot;quotas.&quot; The use of this hot-button word creates the 

impression that schools, especially in the area of athletics, must 

set aside a certain mandatory number of slots for women. In fact, 

every court that has heard this argument has said that Title IX 

does NOT require quotas. A school can comply with Title IX by 

showing that it is trying to expand opportunities for female 

athletes or that it is accommodating the interests of female 

students at the school. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nothing in Title IX requires colleges and universities to cut 

men's teams. Most schools comply with Title IX by adding athletic 

opportunities for women without cutting teams. A March 2001 

General Accounting Office study found that 72 percent of those 

colleges and universities that added women's teams did so without 

cutting any men's teams. Football and basketball continue to 

consume the majority of men's total athletic budgets in Division 

I-A schools -- 72 percent -- forcing the other men's programs to 

compete for the remaining funds, with the women's program also 

getting only a small share of the total athletics budget. </font></p>
