<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - June 26 - Members 
of the House of Representatives today opposed stepped-up U.S. re-engagement with 
the Indonesian military (TNI). In a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld 
and Secretary of State Colin Powell, they wrote that making additional &quot;military 
assistance available at this point is not only unnecessary, but likely to undermine 
efforts aimed at reforming the TNI.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter -- initiated 
by Representatives Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Lane Evans (D-IL) and signed by over 
50 Members of Congress -- expressed alarm at recent Pentagon moves to circumvent 
Congressional restrictions on U.S. engagement with the TNI.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This letter demonstrates 
Congressional recognition that the impunity enjoyed by Indonesian security forces 
for crimes against humanity committed in East Timor jeopardizes the new country's 
long-term security and threatens democratic reform in Indonesia,&quot; said Karen 
Orenstein, Washington Coordinator of the East Timor Action Network (ETAN). &quot;Human 
rights violations have only escalated in Aceh, Papua, and elsewhere in Indonesia 
as the Pentagon and others in the Administration have aggressively campaigned 
to remove barriers to engagement with the brutal TNI.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The members of Congress 
wrote, &quot;While some argue for the need to open channels of communication to 
influence the TNI, we note that a number of channels have recently been opened.... 
It would be prudent to wait and see whether such renewed contacts have any positive 
effects, or whether the TNI's human rights behavior remains poor.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The signers urged that the 
administration officials &quot;not oppose the Congress continuing FMF [Foreign 
Military Finance] and IMET [International Military Education and Training] restrictions 
that might be included in the FY03 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.&quot; 
These restrictions, which must be renewed annually, are based on seven conditions 
known as the &quot;Leahy conditions&quot; related to accountability for rights 
abuses in East Timor and Indonesia and military reform.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[See <a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/06house.htm" target="_new">http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/06house.htm</a> 
for the complete text of the letter and list of signers.]</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress first voted to 
restrict IMET for Indonesia, which brings foreign military officers to the U.S. 
for training, in response to the November 12, 1991 Santa Cruz massacre in East 
Timor. All military ties were severed in September 1999 as the Indonesian military 
and its militia proxies razed East Timor in retaliation for its pro-independence 
vote. The original Leahy conditions were codified into law in late 1999 and modified 
last November.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late 2001, the Department 
of Defense Appropriations Act established the new Regional Defense Counter-terrorism 
Fellowship Program. Representatives wrote in today's letter that &quot;If applied 
to Indonesia, the [program] ... would strip the congressionally-mandated IMET 
restriction of its intended effect.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter seeks &quot;assurances 
that... Indonesian participants and their subordinates in U.S. police or military 
training programs, particularly those focused on counter-terrorism, will not use 
tactics learned from the U.S. military against their own people in domestic conflicts.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter also notes that 
&quot;clear links remain between members of government and security forces and 
this militant group [Laskar Jihad].&quot;</font></p>

Network/U.S. (ETAN) advocates for democracy, sustainable development, justice 
and human rights for the people of East Timor and Indonesia. </i></font></p>
