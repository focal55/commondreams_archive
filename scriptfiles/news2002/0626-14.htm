- June 26 - Congress violated the constitutional separation of church and state 
when it passed a law adding the words &quot;under God&quot; to the Pledge to the 
Flag, and public school officials cannot pressure students to recite it, a federal 
appellate court has ruled.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held today that the 1954 congressional 
action incorporating religious language into the Pledge was an &quot;impermissible 
endorsement of religion.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A profession that we are a nation 'under God' is identical&#8230;to a 
profession that we are a nation 'under Jesus,' a nation 'under Vishnu,' a nation 
'under Zeus,' or a nation 'under no god,' because none of these professions can 
be neutral with respect of religion,&quot; observed the court.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added the court, &quot;The coercive effect of this policy is particularly pronounced 
in the school setting given the age and impressionability of schoolchildren, and 
their understanding that they are required to adhere to the norms set by their 
school, their teacher and their fellow students.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation 
of Church and State, said the court decision reflects an appropriate concern for 
the religious liberty rights of all Americans.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This decision shows respect for freedom of conscience,&quot; said Lynn. 
&quot;You can be a patriotic American regardless of your religious belief or lack 
of religion. Our government should never coerce school children -- or anyone else 
-- to make a profession of religious belief.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America is an incredibly diverse country with some 2,000 different religions 
and denominations, as well as millions of Americans who profess no religion at 
all,&quot; continued Lynn. &quot;Government actions should respect that diversity.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn noted that the Pledge of Allegiance was originally secular. Written in 
1892 by a Baptist minister, the Pledge was recited for several decades without 
any religious references.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Today's ruling simply says that schools should return to the original 
Pledge,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;There wasn't anything wrong with it before 1954. 
In fact, America survived the Great Depression and won two World Wars with a completely 
secular Pledge.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Members of Congress made a mistake when they added religious language 
to the flag pledge,&quot; concluded Lynn. &quot;It changed an appropriate patriotic 
exercise into a religious ritual in which many Americans cannot in good conscience 
participate.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The challenge to religious language in the pledge was brought by Michael A. 
Newdow, a California atheist who objected to the pledge recitation at his daughter's 
elementary school in the Elk Grove Unified School District.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, who wrote today's Newdow v. U.S. Congress decision, 
was appointed to the federal court by President Richard Nixon.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, 
D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance 
of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
