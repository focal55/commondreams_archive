- May 15 - In the week preceding the 

annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 

Shimonoseki, Japan, 80,000 Russian citizens signed petitions 

calling for Japan to stop its cruel and unnecessary scientific 

whaling. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The petitions are being presented today to the Japanese Embassy 

in Moscow by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which collected them during the organization's 

annual Animal Action Week event. The more than 80,000 signatories 

of the petitions called on Japan to hear their voices of opposition 

to Japan's recently launched and highly criticized 'Save Them, Eat 

Them' campaign to bring back public demand for whale meat and 

overturn the current ban on whaling. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IFAW also called on the Russian Government today to vote in the 

interests of whale conservation at the IWC meeting in Shimonoseki, 

one of Japan's largest whaling ports. This year's IWC meeting is a 

crucial one for whale conservation as Japan continues to 

aggressively campaign for an end to the IWC global moratorium on 

commercial whaling, and has increased its influence over small 

island nations to vote with them on pro-whaling issues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan currently kills hundreds of minke whales every year in the 

name of &quot;science&quot; as well as sperm and Bryde's whales. In February, 

Japan not only increased the number of minke whales it will take 

this year, but added the endangered sei whale to its list of 

species hunted. The meat from Japan's 'scientific' whaling ends up 

in Japanese meat markets in Tokyo; while IFAW DNA research has 

revealed that meat from other protected whale species also ends up 

for sale. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Masha Vorontsova, IFAW Country Director for Russia said, &quot;As the 

pro-whaling nations gain ground, the international community must 

ensure we never return to the days of uncontrolled whaling which 

brought some populations of whales to the brink of extinction. 

Japan is part of that community and must realize that its whaling 

operation is an outdated and cruel practice. Every vote at next 

week's IWC meeting is vital and we are urging the Russian 

Government to vote for whale conservation and not with Japan.&quot; </font></p>
