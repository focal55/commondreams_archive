<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">QUITO, 
ECUADOR - July 17 - Quito police today arrested activist Julia Butterfly Hill 
and at least 7 other peaceful protestors outside the Quito offices of US oil company 
Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Most of those arrested represent Ecuadorian communities 
adversely affected by the new OCP pipeline being built by Oxy. Julia Butterfly 
is in Ecuador to show her support for the national struggle to resist the destructive 
petroleum infrastructure project. 
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Community representatives from Mindo, Esmeraldas, Lago Agrio and Shushufindi, 
along with members of Acci&oacute;n Ecol&oacute;gica and Amazon Watch, had arrived 
at the Oxy offices with Julia Butterfly for a 3pm meeting with senior officials 
to discuss the environmental and social impacts of the project. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon arrival, the delegation was refused entrance to the meeting at which time 
the crowd peacefully began to protest their exclusion. Shortly thereafter the 
arrests were made. In some cases, police acted violently kicking community representatives, 
and dragging them by the hair to throw them against vehicles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The protest still continues with the crowd largely comprised of individuals 
whose homes and communities are threatened by the controversial pipeline. After 
50 demonstrators shut down Oxy&#8217;s offices for two hours and closed Avenida 
Amazonas, one of Quito&#8217;s main streets, in front of their office, Oxy finally 
agreed to meet with community representatives early this evening.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before her arrest at around 5pm Quito time, Julia Butterfly said:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;I am here working to help the people affected by oil exploitation to 
have their chance to be heard. Why can&#8217;t Oxy look these affected people 
in the eye?&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yesterday Julia Butterfly, best known for her two-year tree sit 200 feet atop 
a 2000-year old threatened California old growth redwood tree, accompanied several 
dozen local community members from Mindo, and members of Acci&oacute;n Ecol&oacute;gica 
and Amazon Watch, in a re-occupation of the Guarumos construction site of the 
OCP in the Mindo Nambillo Cloudforest Reserve, in order to bear witness to the 
destruction caused by the building of the pipeline.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mindo residents discovered Monday that construction has illegally advanced 
200 meters inside the Guarumos property owned by the community. Residents have 
notified the OCP consortium and the police that such actions constitute illegal 
trespass on private lands. A judge is expected to visit the site Friday, accompanied 
by community members, to issue a ruling on the property lines.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Mindo Nambillo Cloudforest Reserve, through which the OCP is being built, 
is an unparalleled epicenter of biodiversity and home to more than 450 species 
of birds&#8212;46 threatened by extinction. Construction works have now reached 
a tapering knife-edge ridge, high above the region&#8217;s watersheds. According 
to Atossa Soltani, Executive Director of Amazon Watch, &#8220;to bring heavy machinery 
up here would cause massive landslides and a massacre of incredible and endangered 
ecosystems.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lead financer, German bank WestLB, has come under intense fire for syndicating 
a $900 million loan to the OCP in violation of its own lending policies. The loan, 
which does not meet minimum World Bank environmental guidelines has sparked public 
outrage in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia (NWR), which holds a 43 
percent stake in WestLB. In recent months, several German government delegations 
have visited Ecuador to investigate the issue. US bank, Citigroup has also been 
highlighted as a top lender to consortium members. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Los Angeles-based Occidental is a key member of the OCP consortium, and is 
planning significant expansion of its Ecuador operations in pristine Amazon ecosystems, 
in expectation of the pipeline&#8217;s completion. According to government sources, 
the majority of Amazon crude that will flow through the OCP pipeline is destined 
for markets on the West Coast of the United States. The OCP Consortium includes: 
Alberta Energy (Canada), Occidental Petroleum (OXY- USA), AGIP (Italy), Repsol-YPF 
(Spain), Perez Companc (Argentina), and Techint (Argentina). The US Bank JP Morgan 
Chase is the financial advisor for the project. </font></p>
