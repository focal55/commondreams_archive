- July 17 - The Terrorist Information and Prevention System, according to U.S. 
government web sites [<a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/tips.html" target="_new">http://www.citizencorps.gov/tips.html</a>, 
<a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/enews/tips01.html" target="_new">http://www.citizencorps.gov/enews/tips01.html</a>], 
will involve &quot;millions of American workers&quot; such as &quot;truck drivers, 
bus drivers, train conductors, mail carriers, utility readers, ship captains, 
and port personnel&quot; in a &quot;national system for reporting suspicious, 
and potentially terrorist-related activity.&quot; The following policy analysts 
are available for interviews:</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ATHAN THEOHARIS, <a href="http://www.derechos.net/paulwolf/cointelpro/theoharris.htm" target="_new">http://www.derechos.net/paulwolf/cointelpro/theoharris.htm</a><br>
Theoharis, a professor of history at Marquette University, is author of books 
that include &quot;Spying on Americans&quot; and the recently released &quot;Chasing 
Spies: How the FBI Failed in Counterintelligence But Promoted the Politics of 
McCarthyism in the Cold War Years.&quot; He said today: &quot;Just as the government 
is now trying to anticipate terrorism, during the Cold War it tried to anticipate 
espionage. Hoover tried to solicit reports from people to root out Soviet spies 
and the results were just outrageous. It brought out the crazies and people who 
wanted to damage certain individuals, using misinformation and false allegations 
which were then used by the FBI -- like those made against Pulitzer Prize-winning 
writer Harrison Salisbury and Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson. 
From 1936 to 1956 there was an 1,800-percent increase in FBI appropriations. The 
agency placed illegal wiretaps and conducted break-ins. It failed in catching 
Soviet spies, but succeeded in helping to shape public opinion. Terrorists and 
spies take precautions to minimize discovery. The government's techniques then 
-- and now, it seems -- don't end up getting the perpetrators, but target people 
based on things like political activity and now religious beliefs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KIT GAGE, <a href="mailto:kgage@igc.org">kgage@igc.org</a><br>
Gage is director of the First Amendment Foundation. She said today: &quot;This 
will be counterproductive in fighting terrorism as it will result in the further 
inundation of law enforcement with largely or entirely irrelevant information 
when it should be concentrating on following the trails of evidence. More dangerously, 
it may completely intimidate communities, stifle dissent activity, and head us 
in an uncontrollable way toward a police state.&quot;</font></p>

Professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, Cole said today: &quot;The 
war on terrorism requires the cooperation of us all, but we must be very careful 
to ensure that citizens not trample on their fellow citizens' constitutional rights 
of privacy in the name of cooperation. The danger is that we will become a society 
in which no one can trust anyone else, and that is hardly a society we want to 
live in.&quot;</font></p>
