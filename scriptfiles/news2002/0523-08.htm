<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - The National Women's Law 

Center is profoundly disappointed that a majority of the Senate 

Judiciary Committee has voted to approve the nomination of D. 

Brooks Smith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 

Judge Smith, who currently serves on a federal district court in 

Western Pennsylvania, has a troubling record on issues of 

particular concern to women, including his continued membership in 

a club that excludes women despite his promise to the Senate 

Judiciary Committee that he would resign. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We call on the full Senate to reject this nomination,&quot; said 

Marcia D. Greenberger, NWLC Co-President. &quot;Judge Smith's refusal 

to resign from a discriminatory club, especially when viewed in 

combination with other troubling statements and rulings in his 

record, demonstrates that he does not belong on the Court of 

Appeals.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Smith was for many years a member of a club that bars 

women from membership. Membership in a club that discriminates on 

the basis of sex, race, national origin or religion is prohibited 

by the code of judicial conduct because it can be viewed as a 

judge's tacit endorsement of the discriminatory practices. 

Moreover, during his 1988 confirmation hearing for the district 

court seat he now holds, Judge Smith assured the Senate Judiciary 

Committee that he would resign from the club if he could not get it 

to change its rules within a year. But he did not resign until 

1999 -- over ten years later -- when the seat he now seeks on the 

Third Circuit became vacant. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Smith has also espoused extreme views on Congress' 

authority to enact important protections for women like the 

Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). In a 1993 speech to the 

Federalist Society, he stated an extremely narrow view of Congress' 

authority to protect women from violence and disregarded the 

extensive Congressional findings that supported VAWA. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Judge Smith's decisions as a district court judge include some 

that reflect a disregard for established legal principles 

protecting against sex discrimination. For example, he struck down 

an affirmative action policy for female firefighters, relying on an 

incorrect and overly stringent standard of review. In another 

case, he upheld a family leave provision that applied to mothers 

but not fathers, seemingly assuming that only mothers raise 

children; a higher court reversed the decision. </font></p>
