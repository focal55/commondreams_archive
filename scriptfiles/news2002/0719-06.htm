&nbsp;- July 19 - &quot;Yesterday's action by the Senate Appropriations Committee 

restoring full International Military Education and Training (IMET) for Indonesia 

sets back the pursuit of justice for East Timor, as well as military reform and 

democracy in Indonesia. It gives a green light for the Indonesian military (TNI) 

to continue its escalating use of brutal tactics against civilians, especially 

in Aceh and West Papua.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Indonesian military (TNI) undoubtedly will take the restoration of 

prestigious U.S. military training as an endorsement of business as usual and 

as U.S. support for continued abuse of human rights. The Senators who voted to 

restore full IMET have effectively given U.S. backing to continued gross violations 

of human rights.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the name of the 'war on terrorism,' the Senate committee will only 

promote the continued terrorization of the Indonesian people by its military.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We strongly urge the House of Representatives and the full Senate to 

restore the IMET ban before the final version of the foreign operations appropriations 

legislation passes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We thank Senator Leahy and others on the committee who supported the 

continued restriction of IMET.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On July 19, 2002, the Senate Committee on Appropriations accepted an amendment 

by Senators Inouye (D-HI) and Stevens (R-AK) to lift restrictions on International 

Military Education and Training (IMET) for Indonesia in the Fiscal Year 2003 Foreign 

Operations Appropriations Bill. Before becoming law, the legislation must pass 

the full Senate, as well as the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee 

and the full House. Then any differences between the two bills must be reconciled 

before the legislation is sent to the President.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress first voted to restrict IMET for Indonesia, which brings foreign military 

officers to the U.S. for training, in response to the November 12, 1991 Santa 

Cruz massacre of more than 270 civilians in East Timor. All military ties were 

severed in September 1999 as the Indonesian military and its militia proxies razed 

East Timor following its pro-independence vote. Congress first passed the &quot;Leahy 

conditions&quot; in late 1999 and strengthened them last November. The FY00 through 

FY02 foreign operations appropriations laws required president to certify that 

Indonesia had met these conditions before regular IMET and Foreign Military Finance 

(FMF) weapons sales were restored for Indonesia. Last year, Congress allowed civilians 

from Indonesia's defense ministry to participate in the Expanded IMET program, 

which involves course work in such areas as civilian control of the military and 

human rights. The current Senate bill continues to restrict FMF for Indonesia 

and places conditions on its restoration.</font></p>
