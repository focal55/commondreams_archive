- July 18 - This new map of Baltimore is a graphic depiction of the Baltimore 
communities put at risk by a worst-case accident or terrorist attack on a rail 
car containing 90 tons of chlorine. It was reported to the EPA by the Condea Vista 
facility in Baltimore. <a href="http://www.greenpeaceusa.org/graphics/toxics/baltimore_map_2002.gif" target="_new"><img src="images/0718-02.gif" width="81" height="81" border="0"></a></font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The unnecessary use of chlorine 
and other toxic chemicals results in large volumes of these substances being shipped 
(100,000 chlorine shipments a year according to the Department of Transportation) 
through highly populated areas such as the Baltimore tunnel adjacent to Camden 
Yards and Harborplace. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, there 
were 2,983 train accidents in 2000, up almost 8 percent from 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">July 18th marks the first 
anniversary of the Baltimore Tunnel train fire that paralyzed the city for days. 
To commemorate this date, Greenpeace, Clean Water Action and other Baltimore area

the continuing threats posed by future accidents and possible terrorist attacks.</font></p>

Lessons Learned: In the Aftermath of September 11th (February 1, 2002)<br>
Since last year, communities such as Baltimore have gone from experiencing the 
hazards of shipping highly toxic substances through populated areas to the more 
startling threats posed by terrorist attacks. A newly leaked EPA report, &quot;Lessons 
Learned in the Aftermath of September 11, 2001&quot; noted that:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Two specific incidents 
where security was a specific concern were identified: (1) railroads did not want 
to ship chlorine in tankers after attacks...(2) EPA received requests to reroute 
chemical tankers and trucks away from the population centers.&quot;<br>
Additional leaked documents from EPA show a dramatic reversal in policy by the 
EPA. While two of these documents express the need for legislation, one outlines 
a proposal very similar to a bill introduced in the U.S. Senate last October by 
Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ). However, EPA's latest document says that they are 
&quot;not seeking legislation on chemical security at this time.&quot; This abrupt 
reversal is exactly what the chemical industry has been lobbying for.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fortunately, the U.S. Senate 
does not agree. Senator Cozine's bill (S.1602) also known as the Chemical Security 
Act, is now slated for a committee vote on July 25th. The pending Homeland Security 
legislation would completely fail to protect thousands of communities located 
near hazardous chemical facilities without a prevention program at the EPA similar 
to the Corzine bill. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following last July's Baltimore 
tunnel fire, Greenpeace urged the EPA to conduct dioxin testing in and around 
the tunnel fire site to determine if nearby residents were exposed (read our letter 
to EPA).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally on July 27, 2001, 
the EPA conducted tests but only collected 3 samples. Greenpeace had recommended 
that 25 to 30 samples be taken as the EPA has done in previous investigations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The delay in sampling may 
have seriously compromised the accuracy of how much dioxin was released from the 
fire because of heavy rain the occurred before EPA took their samples. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the EPA still found 
elevated levels of dioxin at 25 to 150 times average soil &quot;background&quot; 
levels. The results were:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">329 parts per trillion (ppt/TEQ) 
of dioxin on the tunnel wall <br>
172 ppt/TEQ just outside the tunnel <br>
54 ppt/TEQ on a rail car taken out of the tunnel </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These results are very strong 
evidence that dioxin was produced and released during the July 18th train tunnel 
fire, probably a result of the chlorine based hydrochloric acid leaking from the 
derailed tank cars.</font></p>
