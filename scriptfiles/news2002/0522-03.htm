<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  

- May 22 -  Today, the Brady Campaign 

to Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March (MMM) 

hailed the Pennsylvania primary victory of Ed Rendell, Democratic 

candidate for Governor and a long-time advocate of sensible gun 

laws. The Brady Campaign Voter Education Fund and the MMM endorsed 

Rendell, and were a key presence in the primary. Gun violence 

prevention issues figured prominently in Rendell's race against Bob 

Casey. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I congratulate Mayor Rendell on his victory in this highly 

competitive primary,&quot; said Michael D. Barnes, president of the 

Brady Campaign. &quot;As we work to create an America free from gun 

violence, Ed Rendell is a leader who is capable of making this 

dream a reality for the residents of Pennsylvania. We look forward 

to working with him to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and 

children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This race proves yet again that Americans want common-sense gun 

laws and they will support elected officials who pursue them. Ed 

Rendell is to be commended for having the 'courage of his 

convictions,' even in the face of an aggressive negative 

advertising campaign launched by the National Rifle Association. 

Ed never wavered in his support for the sensible gun laws that 

would help to make Pennsylvania's neighborhoods safe from gun 

violence.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brady Campaign, the Million Mom March and other gun violence 

prevention groups endorsed Ed Rendell early in his campaign and 

were active throughout Tuesday's primary election. Sarah Brady 

campaigned for Mayor Rendell, including recording a voice message 

on Rendell's strong record on gun violence prevention that reached 

more than 10,000 Pennsylvania homes. Ed Rendell's victory comes in 

spite of the National Rifle Association's well-funded attempts to 

defeat him through an attack-advertising blitz and a significant 

&quot;get-out-the-vote&quot; campaign. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the Mayor of Philadelphia, Rendell aggressively sought 

passage of a one-gun-a-month bill for the Commonwealth of 

Pennsylvania, recognizing that such laws thwart gun trafficking and 

drastically reduce the number of guns that fall into the black 

market each year. Similar initiatives have been extremely 

successful in Virginia and other states. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ed Rendell grasps that there are tangible steps that can -- and 

should -- be taken now to reduce gun violence and increase firearm 

safety,&quot; continued Barnes. &quot;He supports the development of 

personalized smart guns and standards for trigger locks, two 

measures that would go a long way toward reducing tragic gun deaths 

-- especially those terrible incidents where children are killed 

after finding a firearm that wasn't stored properly.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pennsylvania is fertile ground for advancing common-sense gun 

safety measures. In January, a Pennsylvania court preserved the 

right of State Police to maintain a 70-year-old handgun sales 

database used by the department to help solve crimes. This 

decision confirms that gun sale records are a critical tool for law 

enforcement officials. Such records provide a starting point for 

investigators when a handgun is used in a crime, and they can help 

to disarm felons who may have bought guns legally in the past, but 

have since committed a crime and are no longer allowed to possess 

firearms. </font></p>
