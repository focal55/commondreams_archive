- June 14 - As Americans head outdoors this weekend to enjoy one of the first 
summer weekends, Sierra Club members and environmentalists nationwide will voice 
opposition to the unpopular and unfair Recreation Fee Demonstration Program, or 
&quot;fee-demo.&quot; This Saturday is the National Day of Action to protest the 
fee-demo program that charges recreational user fees for using public lands that 
are already supported by federal tax dollars.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This summer as Americans head out to public lands to fish, hunt, camp 
and hike, they should not have to pay to play,&quot; said Sierra Club Executive 
Director Carl Pope. &quot;The American people already own these lands. We pay 
taxes every April 15th to support federal management of these public lands.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Fee-demo is a socially and environmentally unsound program that taxes 
Americans for exploring and enjoying their special places,&quot; said Pope. &quot;It 
does not make economic or environmental sense to charge fees for low-impact recreational 
activities while subsidizing extractive industries that waste American taxes and 
wreak havoc on the environment. Why should we tax the American people but foot 
the bill for big corporations?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rather than appropriate sufficient funding for public land protection and management, 
Congress consistently chooses to subsidize extractive industrial uses of our lands 
like mining, grazing and logging. The General Accounting Office (GAO), in trying 
to assess the amount of taxpayer money lost on the commerical logging program, 
found the Forest Service's accounting to be &quot;totally unreliable.&quot; Between 
1992-1997, the GAO estimates that the USFS lost $2 billion in taxpayer money on 
commercial logging in our National Forests.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fee-demo program, first created by Congress in 1996 and extended twice 
by rider, is indicative of a trend toward the commercialization and motorization 
of recreation on public lands. The administration has moved to make this controversial 
program permanent while many Americans are working to end fee-demo. Fee-demo charges 
entry fees for hiking, fishing and other low-impact recreational activities in 
National Forests and other public lands, discouraging many Americans from exploring 
their birthright and creating barriers for low-income Americans to enjoy public 
lands.</font></p>
