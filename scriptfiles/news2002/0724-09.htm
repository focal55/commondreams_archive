<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CARY, NORTH CAROLINA - July 

24 - New Yorker Rita Lasar, a member of September Eleventh Families for Peaceful 

Tomorrows, will be a keynote speaker in Japan at two major international events 

highlighting alternatives to terrorism, militarism and war. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On July 27, Lasar will 

address The International Symposium of the 48th Mother's Congress entitled: &quot;For 

a 21st Century Free of Terrorism, Nuclear Weapons and War - Unity and Solidarity 

between Japanese Women and Women All over the World,&quot; which is expected to 

draw 10,000 attendees to Fukuoka Prefecture.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On August 4, Lasar will 

be a keynote speaker at the opening plenary of the 2002 World Conference Against 

Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, a gathering which will bring another 10,000 participants 

to Hiroshima. The theme will be, &quot;Working Together for a Peaceful and Promising 

World Without Nuclear Weapons&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During her two-week stay, 

Lasar also will tour the Kyoto Museum for World Peace at Ritsumeikan University 

and visit Hiroshima Peace Park and Peace Memorial Museum. On August 3, she will 

enjoy a reunion with members of the Hiroshima Alliance for Nuclear Weapons Abolition 

(HANWA) which toured the U.S. this past April, visited the World Trade Center 

site, and made joint speaking appearances with Lasar and other members of Peaceful 

Tomorrows. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A retired businesswoman 

living in Manhattan, Lasar lost her brother, Abe Zelmanowitz, at the World Trade 

Center on September 11. Although he worked on a low floor and could have escaped 

easily, he chose to stay behind with a wheelchair-bound co-worker. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During a September 11 memorial 

service at the National Cathedral, President George W. Bush praised Zelmanowitz 

for his courage. But the President later refused to meet with Lasar and other 

members of Peaceful Tomorrows to discuss the creation of an Afghan Victims Fund. 

Lasar has been a vocal proponent of the fund since her historic January, 2002, 

trip to Afghanistan, where she and three other members of Peaceful Tomorrows met 

with innocent Afghan victims who had lost loved ones to the U.S.-led retaliatory 

bombing campaign.</font></p>
