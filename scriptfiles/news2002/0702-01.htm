<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">COLUMBUS, 
GA - July 2 - Thirty-seven human rights activists will stand trial in federal 
court next week for civil disobedience at the School of the Americas (renamed 
Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) in Columbus, Georgia. They 
were among 10,000 who gathered last November to call for the closure of the notorious 
school. The defendants peacefully crossed onto Ft. Benning, site of the school. 
They are charged with trespass and face up to six months in federal prison and 
$5,000 in fines. Trial is scheduled to start July 8 before Judge G. Mallon Faircloth 
in Columbus. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Faircloth is known for giving the maximum of six months to opponents 
of the SOA/WHISC. Seventy-one people have served a total of over forty years in 
prison for engaging in nonviolent resistance in a broad-based campaign to close 
the school. Last year 26 people were prosecuted, including Dorothy Hennessey, 
an 88 year-old Franciscan nun who was sentenced to six months in federal prison. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Those who speak out for justice are facing harsh prison sentences while 
SOA-trained torturers and assassins are operating with impunity,&#8221; said SOA 
Watch founder Fr. Roy Bourgeois. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SOA/WHISC is a combat training school for Latin American soldiers. Its 
graduates are consistently involved in human rights abuses and atrocities. In 
1996 the Pentagon was forced to release training manuals used at the school that 
advocated the use of torture, extortion and execution. In December 2000 Congress 
authorized the WHISC to replace the SOA. The renaming of the school was widely 
viewed as an attempt to diffuse public criticism and to disassociate the school 
from its reputation. SOA Watch maintains that the underlying purpose of the school, 
to control the economic and political systems of Latin America by aiding and influencing 
Latin American militaries, remains the same. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The SOA is the terrorist training camp in our own backyard,&#8221; said 
Bourgeois. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOA Watch works to stand in solidarity with people of Latin America, to change 
oppressive US foreign policy, and to close the SOA/WHISC. </font></p>
