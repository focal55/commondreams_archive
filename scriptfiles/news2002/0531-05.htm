- May 31 - Breathing toxic chemicals in the outdoor air exposes all Americans to a lifetime cancer risk at least 10 times greater than the level considered acceptable by the EPA and under federal law, and more than 20 million Americans face an added lifetime cancer risk at least 100 times the standard, according to data released today by the U.S. EPA.  Moreover, the risk estimates do not include the potential cancer risks associated with exposure to diesel exhaust, which by many indications is responsible for the bulk of the real-life cancer risks from toxic air pollution.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These findings are a wake up call that EPA should take action to reduce this long overlooked public health threat,&quot; said Emily Figdor, Clean Air Advocate at U.S. PIRG.  &quot;After nearly a decade of delay, EPA still has yet to fulfill its mandate under the Clean Air Act to reduce the risks posed by toxic emissions from cars, trucks, and non-road engines, like construction and farm equipment, and their fuels.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment estimates the potential health risks associated with the 32 air toxics considered of greatest concern in urban areas.  It also estimates exposure concentrations, but not health risks, associated with diesel exhaust.  The study uses 1996 emissions data and modeling to estimate cancer and non-cancer risks at the census tract level.  EPA considers lifetime cancer risks exceeding one case per one million residents to warrant concern.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data confirm that emissions from cars, trucks, and non-road engines contribute substantially to the cancer risk from air toxics, particularly in urban areas.  For more than 100 million Americans, toxic emissions from mobile sources alone are responsible for an added lifetime cancer risk that is more than 10 times the accepted standard.  This risk estimate is dominated by the emissions of benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 1,3 butadiene.  However, the estimate does not include the cancer risk associated with diesel exhaust, because the agency has not settled on a precise estimate of its carcinogenic potency.  The report does indicate that diesel exhaust is among the air toxics that pose the greatest public health risk.  In a separate study, air quality officials in California estimated that more than 70% of the increased cancer risk from airborne toxics in the state results from diesel particulate pollution.  A 2000 study by state and local air quality administrators estimates that the filthy soot spewed by diesel engines is responsible for more than 125,000 additional cancers in the U.S. over a lifetime of exposure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This study adds a new urgency to EPA's plans to propose fuel and emission standards for non-road diesel engines,&quot; said Figdor.  &quot;By the end of the year, EPA should propose tough standards for these engines that are on par with the standards recently adopted for diesel trucks and buses.  Reducing exposure to diesel exhaust is an essential element in reducing the public health risk from air toxics.&quot;</font></p>
