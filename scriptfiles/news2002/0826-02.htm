<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 26 - 

Amid growing protests from both within the United States and abroad, the state 

of Texas is prepared to execute yet another African American juvenile offender. 

If the execution of Toronto Patterson proceeds as scheduled on Wednesday, Aug. 

28, it will mean that the past six executions of juvenile offenders in the United 

States will have taken place in Texas and will have involved African Americans.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Steven W. Hawkins, executive 

director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said that Patterson's 

scheduled execution confirms many troubling aspects of the death penalty, not 

the least of which that it is used against juvenile offenders.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;Toronto's coerced 

confession did not even conform with physical and forensic evidence at the crime 

scene,&quot; Hawkins said. &quot;Toronto's trial attorneys did not reveal to the 

jury the full circumstances surrounding Toronto's so-called confession. They did 

not offer to the jury substantial mitigating evidence concerning Toronto's background. 

They failed even to present biological evidence that juvenile offenders have lesser 

capacity for reflective judgment and impulse control than adult offenders. This 

should obviously not have been a death penalty case.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hawkins renewed his call 

for Texas Gov. Rick Perry to acknowledge the role that race and geography play 

in the application of the death penalty, particularly as it relates to juvenile 

offenders, and to stay Toronto's execution.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;Texas has accounted 

for 12 of the 20 juvenile offender executions in the United States during the 

past two decades,&quot; he said. &quot;Eight of the twelve juvenile offenders 

executed in Texas have been African American or Latino. The death penalty in the 

United States disproportionately affects people of color and this is even more 

true when it comes to juvenile offenders.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hawkins noted that of the 

80 juvenile offenders on death row in the United States, 51, or almost two thirds, 

are people of color. Of the 80 inmates, just over half -- 41 -- are from Texas 

or Alabama.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The past five juvenile 

offenders executed in Texas were T.J. Jones, executed Aug. 8; Napolean Beazley, 

executed May 28; Gerald Mitchell, executed Oct. 22, 2001; Gary Graham, executed 

June 22, 2000; and Glen McGinnis, executed Jan. 25, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hawkins added that Texas 

is speeding up its pace of executing juvenile offenders even as the international 

community shuns the practice. Only three countries -- the United States, Iran 

and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- are believed to currently execute juvenile 

offenders. Earlier this month, Pakistan announced it is sparing the lives of 72 

juvenile offenders while in the Philippines, the Supreme Court ordered the removal 

of a dozen juvenile offenders from death row, ruling that their execution would 

violate the law.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;Such executions not 

only violate international norms, they also offend human decency,&quot; Hawkins 

said. &quot;The mind of a juvenile offender is by definition less developed than 

the mind of an adult. Juvenile minds do not handle social pressure, instinctual 

urges and other stresses the way that adult minds do. Juvenile offenders therefore 

cannot be held to the same degree of culpability as adults, just as mentally retarded 

people cannot be held to the same degree of culpability. We now ban the execution 

of mentally retarded offenders. There can be little justification for applying 

a different standard when it comes to juveniles.&quot;</font></p>
