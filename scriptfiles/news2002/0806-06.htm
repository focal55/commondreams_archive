<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 6 - 

Anytime you see major legislation railroaded through Congress in the middle of 

the night and then see President Bush&#8217;s same corporate buddies, who were 

allegedly being punished for bad behavior last week, all wildly celebrating this 

bill&#8217;s signing this week, you know it&#8217;s really bad news for most of 

us.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is a great irony that 

Bush&#8217;s desperation for a political win to get off the defensive about the 

corporate criminals who are among his big campaign contributors was satisfied 

today by signing legislation that promotes globally the same extreme deregulation 

of basic consumer safeguards in accounting, energy services and more that has 

cost millions of Americans their jobs and retirement savings.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The usual corporate special 

interests will repeat the tired chant about how Fast Track will be good for us, 

yet the trade pacts generated under the Fast Track model have resulted in a huge, 

economy-slowing, job-killing U.S. trade deficit, wages that have not caught up 

to the 1970s, more unsafe and uninspected imported food and an array of environmental 

and other important public interest laws being attacked and weakened.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The movement against the 

corporate globalization Fast Track promotes grows broader every week, with this 

legislation universally opposed by every U.S. environmental and consumer organization, 

a wide span of religious denominations, small business groups, the NAACP, the 

entire U.S. labor movement, the National Organization for Women, and many other 

groups representing the majority of Americans.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The power of the opposition 

to the Fast Track agenda and the uncertain fate of future pacts is made clear 

by the fact that post 9-11, with the public scared and distracted and a huge corporate 

campaign being waged, it was necessary for a wartime president to come to Capitol 

Hill to personally troll for votes before a trade bill stalled for two years could 

be rammed through Congress by a 2-vote margin in the middle of the night.</font></p>
