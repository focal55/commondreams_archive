- July 31 - A new and shocking set of photographs have revealed fresh atrocities 

by Burma&#8217;s pariah military regime, including the massacre of 12 civilians 

on April 26, 2002. The photos were obtained by the Free Burma Rangers, an organization 

that secretly provides bringing medical supplies, food, education, toys, and spiritual 

encouragement to refugees and internally displaced persons deep inside Burma. 

They provide a rare visual glimpse into intensifying human rights abuses in Burma&#8217;s 

Karen state that the military regime has worked to conceal from international 

scrutiny. The photos can be viewed attached to this release and at <a href="http://www.freeburmacoalition.org" target="_new">www.freeburmacoalition.org</a></font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Republican United States Congressman Joseph Pitts, a member of the International 

Relations Committee, said in a statement in the Congress on Friday that the photos 

&#8220;provide incontrovertible evidence of the State Peace and Development Council's 

(SPDC) horrifying human rights abuses and crimes against humanity as they continue 

their attempt to subjugate the entire country through whatever means they see 

necessary.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The disturbing photographs show the aftermath of a massacre of 12 villagers 

who were attempting to flee to Thailand after their villages were forcibly relocated 

by Burma&#8217;s military regime. 30-40 villagers had stopped to sleep for the 

night at two huts in the forest when the Burmese military came upon them, lined 

up in front of the hut, and opened fire. Ten were killed immediately including 

children aged 2, 5, 7, and 14. Additionally, a pregnant woman and her unborn child 

died two days later. The photos show both the ten bodies of the victims, including 

the children, and the dead pregnant woman. They also show some of the survivors 

of the massacre, including a six year old boy who was shot in the arm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Millions of Burmese people have been forced to leave their homes by the military 

regime; relatively few escape to refugee camps in Thailand. The vast majority 

of the villagers eke out a living in the jungle, always on the run from the regime. 

According to the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Country Report on Human Rights 

in Burma released on March 4, 2002, &#8220;Repressive government policies and 

the military's brutal treatment of members of ethnic insurgencies has produced 

hundreds of thousands of refugees.&#8221; The report goes on to say that &#8220;NGO's 

estimate that there could be as many as one million persons whom the SPDC has 

moved forcibly from their villages and &#8230; NGO's also estimate that an additional 

1 million IDP's also might exist in various other locations throughout the country.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A spokesman for the Free Burma Rangers said, &#8220;This is more than a crisis&#8212;this 

is carnage. When will the world wake up?&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The massacre took place just 10 days before the release from house arrest of 

Burma&#8217;s 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Her release 

has buoyed world hopes of an end to repression in Burma, but the new photos provide 

evidence that abuses by the regime continue unabated in areas outside the capital 

city of Rangoon. Burma&#8217;s regime was also recently censured over reports 

of mass rapes in the Shan state.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Said Congressman Pitts, &#8220;While the military regime woos diplomats, business 

guests, and others in downtown Rangoon, Burma's people are fleeing in fear of 

intensifying and acute repression.&#8221; </font></p>
