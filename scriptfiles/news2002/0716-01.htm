- July 16 - News Advisory:
<p>The Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence, Reps. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) 
and Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.) host a forum today on how fraud and abuse in the 
distribution of firearms allow criminals to get guns. 
<p>The forum will focus on the ease with which criminals can forge federal firearm 
dealer licenses and become gun dealers. Federally licensed gun dealers are entrusted 
with determining the eligibility of gun purchasers by conducting background checks, 
so if a gun dealer decides to ignore federal law or a criminal fraudulently becomes 
a gun dealer, then countless guns can wind up in criminal hands. 
<p>During the forum, clips will be shown from the documentary "Gunshots", which 
exposes how a crooked gun dealer in Oakland, Calif., was able to forge a fake 
extension on his federal gun dealer's license, enabling him to illegally buy and 
sell hundreds of guns, many of which were later used in crime. Panelists also 
will discuss a recent General Accounting Office report that documents the ease 
with which Federal Firearms Licenses can be forged. Panelists will conclude by 
suggesting specific changes that could improve the current gun dealer licensing 
system.
