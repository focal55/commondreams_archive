<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">STOCKHOLM, 
SWEDEN - July 2 - The long-term consequences of modern warfare provide the focus 
of an international conference to be held near Stockholm during 26-28 July 2002. 
The Vietnam Environmental Conference will bring together scientists and other 
experts from all over the world to discuss the continuing impact of the Vietnam 
War. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though formally concluded over a quarter-century ago, the war left a persistent 
legacy of contamination and destruction that has yet to be thoroughly examined. 
The purpose of the conference is to asses the long-term environmental consequences 
in terms of their interrelated effects on ecosystems, public health and economic 
activity. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is hoped that the knowledge resulting from the conference will not only 
be helpful in repairing the wounds of war in the affected countries-- Vietnam, 
Laos and Cambodia-- but will also be useful in analysing the long-term consequences 
of other wars, past, present and future. It may, for example, yield clues about 
what to expect in Afghanistan 25 years from now. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Preparations for the conference are being supervised by an international steering 
committee that includes several distinguished scientists who have conducted research 
in Vietnam. Among them is L. Wayne Dwernychuk of Hatfield Consultants in British 
Columbia, Canada, who points out that, &quot;Although it has been over 25 years 
since the formal conclusion of the Vietnam War, its lingering environmental effects 
are still being felt today. To cite but one example, there has been virtually 
no recovery in the upland forests that were defoliated by Agent Orange between 
1965-1971. Reduced biodiversity of wildlife and forests, soil erosion, unproductive 
land, and other effects of the war continue an unbroken cycle of poverty and hardship.&#8221; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dioxin in Agent Orange, which is the subject of an ongoing scientific and 
political debate, is one of several toxic substances whose effects will be reviewed 
at the conference. Other key issues include the death and disability caused by 
munitions remaining from the war, the spread of diseases such as malaria and lymphoma, 
and the social-psychological consequences for families and communities. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The impact of such factors on the societies of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia has 
been very great. For example, total deaths and casualties caused by land mines 
and other unexploded ordnance since the end of the war far exceed, on a proportional 
basis, those sustained by U. S troops during the war. Given that tens of millions 
of land mines and bomblets remain in the landscape of Indochina, the toll of death 
and suffering is certain to rise in the decades ahead. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These and other long-term consequences will be reviewed in separate reports 
on ecosystems, public health and economic impacts. The ethical, legal and policy 
implications of the Vietnam War will also be addressed. Drafts of the reports 
will be published in advance on the conference web site, then revised on the basis 
of comments and suggestions received. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event will take place during 26-28 July at the Bos&ouml;n Conference Centre, 
located ten kilometres from the Stockholm city centre. Information on the experts 
involved, the issues to be addressed and other details are available on the conference 
web site: <a href="http://www.nnn.se/vietnam/environ.htm" target="_new">http://www.nnn.se/vietnam/environ.htm</a></font></p>
