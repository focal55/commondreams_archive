<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 3 - Official government delegates to the final planning meeting for the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development appear to be moving dangerously closer to abandoning time-tested multinational pacts in favor of loophole-ridden, voluntary, industry-sanctioned agreements, Earth Day Network charged today.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We need agreements that will stick,&quot; said Kathleen Rogers, president of Earth Day Network. &quot;Communities simply cannot rely on the good faith of polluters, traders, and developers to do the right thing,&quot; declared Rogers. A &quot;voluntary&quot; approach will throw the doors wide open to environmental corruption, evasions, and loopholes &ETH; and not progress,&quot; Rogers said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The United Nations summit, scheduled for late August and early September in Johannesburg, South Africa, is intended to create plans of action for governments to agree on that would implement the pledges of the last environmental summit in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Many influential world leaders are aggressively endorsing &Ocirc;voluntary agreements' as a matter of national policy and pressing summit planners to adopt it as the preferred outcome of the summit,&quot; said Rogers. In particular, the Bush Administration favors such an approach. &quot;President Bush seems averse to seizing the opportunity for global leadership on social development and sustainable policies that the summit offers,&quot; said Rogers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Should the use of &quot;voluntary&quot; agreements prevail, it means that corruption will replace compliance, end-runs will displace enforcement, and avoidance will supplant accountability,&quot; Rogers warned. Also, &quot;we can expect any realistic notions of sustainable development to be turned inside out and upside down to justify virtually any action, anywhere, by polluters, traders, and developers,&quot; she added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earth Day Network is not alone in this concern. More than one million individuals and organizations from 105 countries have signed Earth Day Network's letter to all heads of government urging publicly commit to attending the summit and uphold their pledge to produce firm plans of action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earth Day Network joins the chorus of civil society organizations rejecting this step backwards for global action. Nations must honor the mandate of the United Nations General Assembly for the Johannesburg Summit. That mandate requires nations to assign the highest priority to political commitments and measures that include: targets and timeframes, means of implementation and financial resources, institutional requirements, and monitoring and reporting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Anything less than that means rolling back 30 years of international progress, cooperation, and results,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;In addition, nations lose a momentous chance to tame the more insidious and pervasive terrorism of poverty, hunger, homelessness, and inadequate education and health care,&quot; she added.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Earth Day Network's mission is to promote environmental awareness and stewardship by engaging grassroots organizations worldwide in environmental education, citizen action and organizing, capacity building, coordinated global campaigns, and annual Earth Day celebration. Earth Day Network, comprising more than 5,000 organizations in 184 countries, and more than 90,000 educators in the United States, serves as the hub for worldwide Earth Day organizing. </i></font></p>
