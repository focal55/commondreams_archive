- April 29 - Thirteen of the largest newspapers and

magazines in the United States have all but shut out criticism of

genetically modified (GM) food and crops from their opinion pages,

according to a new report by Food First/Institute for Food and

Development Policy.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, <i>Biotech Bias on the Editorial and Opinion Pages of Major

United States Newspapers and News Magazines</i>, found an overwhelming

bias in favor of GM foods not only on editorial pages, but also on

op-ed pages, a forum usually reserved for a variety of opinions. In

fact, the report found that some newspapers surveyed did not publish

a single critical op-ed on GM foods and crops, while publishing

several in support.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is a great disservice to the American public when the media

filters out critical viewpoints on issues that are central to our

times,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal, co-director of Food First/The Institute

for Food and Development Policy. &quot;This is an issue where there is

significant difference of opinion among both scientists and the

general public,&quot; she said, &quot;and those differences must be represented

in the media if the public is to be able to exercise its democratic

right to make informed decisions about new technologies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report investigated 11 newspapers and three weekly news magazines

between September 1999 and August 2001. Out of 40 op-eds, 31

supported GM foods and crops while only seven were critical. Two

op-eds argued for labeling of GM foods. Newspaper editorials were

united in supporting GM foods and crops and only diverged on the

issue of labeling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The papers surveyed were: The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The

Chicago Tribune, The Chicago Sun-Times, The Los Angeles Times, The

Houston Chronicle, Newsday (New York), The Washington Post, USA

Today, and The Wall Street Journal. The newsweekly magazines were:

Time, Newsweek, and The Economist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report is based on searches conducted on the Nexis database using

the search term &quot;bioengineered foods or genetically modified foods or

genetically engineered foods or biotechnology. The findings were

reduced to &quot;editorial or op-ed or opinion or commentary.&quot;</font></p>
