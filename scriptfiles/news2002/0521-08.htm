- May 21 - &quot;On behalf of NARAL I would like to thank Planned Parenthood, National Abortion Federation, the Feminist Majority, the National Women's Law Center, and the National Organization for Women, for standing with me today to support and set the record straight on the Schumer-Hatch amendment. In 24 hours, conferees on the bankruptcy bill will decide whether to hold perpetrators of clinic violence responsible for their illegal actions &#151; or let them off the hook. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What is at issue here is whether we want to let people who violate the law escape responsibility. These debtors are not innocent, peaceful protestors: they owe fines because of their threats and violence against doctors, clinic personnel and women. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Opponents of this provision say it's irrelevant. It's not. This bill is about assuring financial responsibility, and it must include the Schumer-Hatch provision, to hold perpetrators of clinic violence responsible. This provision is no less critical than any of the other 18 existing exemptions Congress has already singled out for special accountability within the bankruptcy code &#151; including drunk drivers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Through their repeated threats and acts of violence, perpetrators of clinic violence have demonstrated flagrant disregard for the law. These defendants are deliberately abusing the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying what juries and courts say they owe. These are not 'honest debtors' seeking a fresh start under the bankruptcy code; they are people trying, often through a coordinated plan, to avoid responsibility for their illegal actions. Any claim that the Schumer-Hatch language is unnecessary and unrelated to the bankruptcy bill is simply wrong. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Tomorrow's conference comes at an opportune time. Last Thursday the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the jury verdict in Planned Parenthood v. ACLA, recognizing the threat posed by the Nuremberg Files web site and the two &quot;WANTED&quot; style posters targeting specific doctors. Six of the Nuremberg Files defendants filed for bankruptcy as part of a litigation strategy designed to avoid paying their penalties. The courts recognize the harm done by violence and threats. Let's not let the perpetrators run into bankruptcy court for a discharge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Lawmakers must reject fake compromises that restate current law and plug the laws current loophole. We applaud Senators Schumer and Hatch for their leadership and commitment as the conference committee debates this amendment. Pressure has intensified, yet they remain steadfast in their efforts to protect and defend the lives of women and health-care professionals who regularly face the threat of violence.&quot; </font></p>
