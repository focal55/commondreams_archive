- September 3 - On the very day that millions of children boarded diesel school 

buses for their first day of the new school year, the U.S. Environmental Protection 

Agency today released its health assessment for diesel exhaust, for the first 

time formally classifying the pollutant as a likely human carcinogen at environmental 

levels of exposure. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Children riding buses back 

to school today need stronger protections against the health impacts of diesel 

exhaust, but the Bush administration is considering rolling back clean air standards 

for diesel buses and trucks,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Clean Air Advocate Emily Figdor.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Early in 2001, EPA issued landmark 

standards to clean up dirty diesel trucks and buses, comparable to the advent 

of the catalytic converter on cars several decades ago. The standards will reduce 

emissions from trucks and buses by more than 90%, the equivalent of taking 13 

million of the nation's 14 million trucks and buses off the roads. The Bush administration 

initially backed the standards after taking office and successfully defended them 

in court against industry challenges.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Until recently, the Bush administration 

appeared committed to ushering in the next generation of diesel vehicles,&quot; 

said Figdor. &quot;In June, however, the administration announced that they might 

allow diesel engine companies to trade emission-reduction credits rather than 

produce cleaner trucks and buses.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of a plan to reduce pollution 

from diesel-powered construction and farm equipment, the administration is considering 

developing an emissions-trading program between the truck and &quot;non-road&quot; 

sectors. This could enable companies to avoid the tough emission reductions required 

for trucks and buses and compromise the clean up of non-road diesel engines, which 

actually release more soot each year than all of the cars, trucks, and buses on 

the roads.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In order to reduce the public's 

exposure to harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should honor its 

commitment to fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses 

and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment,&quot; 

said Figdor.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After more than a decade of scientific 

review, EPA's diesel health assessment evaluates the public health impacts associated 

with exposure to diesel exhaust. In addition to concluding that diesel fumes likely 

cause lung cancer, EPA found that diesel exhaust triggers asthma and other respiratory 

effects. Part of ambient levels of particulate matter, diesel soot can exacerbate 

cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and lead to premature death.</font></p>
