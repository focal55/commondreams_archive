- June 13 - Best known for their world-wide hit &quot;Love Shack,&quot; B-52's 
lead singer Kate Pierson and bass player Sara Lee visited Washington, D.C., today 
to persuade senators to vote against a proposal to build a nuclear waste dump 
at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. The band members met with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 
(D-N.Y.) and members of the staff of Sens. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) and Zell Miller 
(D-Ga.) to discuss the dangers of transporting high-level nuclear waste to the 
proposed dump.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Transporting high-level radioactive 
nuclear waste on the same highways that carry our children to school is a terrible 
idea,&quot; said Pierson, who lives near a projected rail route for the waste 
in the Hudson Valley. &quot;Any senator who votes in support of this nuclear dump 
does so with a guilty conscience.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pierson and Lee spoke Thursday afternoon 
at a briefing for Senate staff, hosted by the Transportation Safety Coalition. 
The briefing was sponsored by Sens. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). 
The band members, along with Lisa Gue, policy analyst for Public Citizen, and 
Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, outlined the problems 
associated with the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Yucca Mountain proposal 
and urged senators to reject the dangerous plan.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We plan to take this message 
on the road in our upcoming national tour,&quot; said Lee, who plays bass with 
the B-52s. &quot;It seems that the government is trying to keep people in the 
dark about the true impacts of the Yucca Mountain plan in terms of nuclear waste 
transportation.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controversial Yucca Mountain 
proposal calls for 77,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste from nuclear facilities 
throughout the country to be shipped through 44 states and the District of Columbia 
to Nevada. Experts project that as many as 390 accidents could occur while transporting 
the dangerous radioactive waste.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last week, the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee narrowly approved a resolution in favor of Yucca Mountain. 
The full Senate is expected to vote in the coming weeks.</font></p>
