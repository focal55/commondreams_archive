- June 27 - Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a senior member of the House Financial 
Services Committee, voted today to subpoena former WorldCom CEO Bernard J. Ebbers 
and other WorldCom executives requiring them to appear at an upcoming hearing 
on the financial mismanagement and corporate abuse of the former telecom giant. 
The stock price has plummeted and they have announced a lay off of 17,000 workers. 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Committee's hearing will be held Monday, July 8. Subpoenas will be issued 
to: Bernard J. Ebbers, former CEO of WorldCom; John W. Sidgmore, former CFO of 
WorldCom; Scott Sullivan, CEO of WorldCom; and Jack Grubman, a telecommunications 
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders said, &quot;I am getting very tired of well paid CEOs ripping off their 
employees, their investors and taxpayers of this country. As a senior member of 
the House Financial Services Committee, I look forward to meeting with the top 
executives of WorldCom so that we can understand what happened there, and do everything 
in our power to prevent this type of corporate behavior from continuing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hearing continues the Committee's examination of accounting problems in 
the telecommunications sector, and their effects on employees, retirees, and investors. 
WorldCom revealed that it had overstated profits and understated expenses by $3.8 
billion, which allowed the firm to artificially meet earnings projections over 
the last five quarters. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders continued, &quot;Congress needs to protect the American people from 
companies and auditors who are willing, for their own gain, to deny important 
financial information to the public. Investors, workers and taxpayers are entitled 
to have a truthful account of the financial condition of a company. It is not 
acceptable that CEOs and auditors continue to cook the books and mislead the public 
about the true financial condition of the companies they work for.&quot; </font></p>
