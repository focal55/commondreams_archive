- May 31 - World Wildlife Fund 

congratulates the European Union -- the European Commission and the 

15 member states -- on completing ratification of the Kyoto Protocol 

and delivering its ratification documents to the United Nations in 

New York today. With this delivery, 69 countries will have ratified 

the climate treaty and the first criterion for the treaty to become 

international law -- ratification by a minimum of 55 countries -- is 

achieved. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;For responsible leaders, there's no question about whether we 

should use available solutions to combat global warming when the 

harmful effects are already being felt,&quot; said Jennifer Morgan, 

director of WWF's Climate Change Program. &quot;EU ratification is a great 

step forward and now leaders of Russia, Japan and Canada must follow 

the EU's example and put in place the only global framework to reduce 

CO2 emissions.&quot; Japan's ratification is close to final and Russia's 

Cabinet approved ratification in April. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EU ratification represents significant progress towards the second 

and final criterion for turning the climate treaty into international 

law -- ratification by the industrialized nations that accounted for 

at least 55 percent of the industrialized world's CO2 emissions in 

1990. Together, the EU member states accounted for approximately a 

quarter of the industrialized world's CO2 emissions in 1990. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the United States, the world's biggest carbon polluter 

representing about a quarter of 1990 emissions, walked out of 

international negotiations to address the global problem of 

increasing CO2 emissions, key other countries must ratify the treaty 

to meet the second criterion. Key central and eastern European 

states, Japan and Russia are on track to ratify and turn the climate 

treaty into international law. Canada is currently considering 

ratification and Canada's Prime Minister has stated that he would 

like to ratify the Kyoto Protocol this year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This commitment to responsible action on climate change by other 

countries stands in stark contrast to recent statements and policy 

decisions by the Bush Administration,&quot; said Morgan. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Earlier this month, Harlan Watson, chief climate negotiator for 

the United States, announced that the United States will not even 

consider the multi-lateral climate treaty for the next 10 years. 

Watson ruled out any U.S. participation in the talks to negotiate 

targets for the second commitment period in 2005. </font></p>
