<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 9 -  Rep. Louise Slaughter 

(D-N.Y.) today introduced legislation to substantially increase 

federal research on hormone disrupting chemicals. World Wildlife 

Fund praised Slaughter's leadership on this issue, citing the 

critical need to protect children from dangerous chemicals that are 

impairing their ability to learn, behave, resist disease, and 

reproduce. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;On the eve of Mother's Day weekend, this new legislation sends 

a message to all mothers that Congress cares about the health and 

well-being of their children,&quot; said Dr. Theo Colborn, director of 

WWF's Wildlife and Contaminants Program and co-author of Our Stolen 

Future. &quot;As a mother and grandmother I am saddened that a mother 

must share these chemicals with her baby before it is born and 

through her breastmilk.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Hormone Disruption Research Act of 2002 would authorize up 

to $500 million for the National Institute of Environmental Health 

Sciences (NIEHS) to conduct and coordinate a five-year research 

program on hormone disruption. NIEHS would also be required to 

provide public reports on the extent to which hormone disrupting 

chemicals pose a threat to human health and the environment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This legislation is long overdue. Not one chemical in use today 

has been adequately tested for its ability to undermine the 

construction of children's bodies and brains,&quot; said Colborn. &quot;There 

is an urgent need to support innovative research designed to 

identify hazards that traditional toxicology has missed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hormone disruptors are synthetic chemicals that block, mimic, or 

otherwise interfere with naturally produced hormones that control 

how an organism develops and functions. People and wildlife are 

exposed daily to these pervasive chemicals that can do damage at 

extremely low exposure levels. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1970s, incidence of childhood cancers, learning 

disabilities, autism, diabetes, early puberty, and abnormal penile 

development has increased substantially. At the same time, evidence 

linking these disorders with exposure to hormone disrupting 

chemicals has continued to mount. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What is especially troubling is that children are exposed to 

these chemicals in the womb and shortly after birth -- periods of 

rapid development. It's time for prevention,&quot; said Colborn. &quot;President Bush has urged the country to not 'leave any child 

behind.' This research ultimately will help all children reach 

their full potential.&quot; </font></p>
