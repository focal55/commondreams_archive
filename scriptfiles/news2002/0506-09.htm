- May 6 - Joining a growing list of oil industry shareholders who support protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 5.26 percent of Phillips Conoco shareholders today voted in favor of an Arctic shareholder resolution at the company's annual meeting. The vote ensures that the Arctic Refuge resolution will be voted on again at next year's annual meeting.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Even among oil company stockholders, support for protecting America's Arctic continues to grow,&quot; said Athan Manuel, author of the resolution and director of U.S. PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign. &quot;From shareholders to Senators, more and more people understand that the Arctic Refuge is a special place that should be protected, not plundered.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Green Century Capital Management and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate filed the resolution in conjunction with U.S. PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign.  This is the first Arctic Refuge shareholder resolution ever filed with Phillips Conoco.  A first-year resolution needs a minimum of 3.5 percent of the vote in order to be refiled the following year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the last four years, the PIRG Arctic Wilderness Campaign has targeted oil companies that have an interest in drilling in the Arctic Refuge. The campaign has filed 11 shareholder resolutions and generated more than 45,000 e-mails, phone calls, and letters to BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron Texaco and Phillips Conoco. For more on the campaign visit <a href="http://www.savethearctic.com" target="_new">www.savethearctic.com</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month a similar resolution was supported by 11 percent of BP shareholders. BP and Phillips Conoco are the two biggest oil companies operating on Alaska's North Slope.  Besides being one of the biggest oil companies in Alaska, Phillips Conoco is a member of Arctic Power, a special interest group funded by the oil industry and the state of Alaska to lobby Congress in support of allowing oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the same day BP shareholders voted on their shareholder resolution, April 18th, the U.S. Senate voted 54 to 46 against allowing oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We call on Phillips Conoco to acknowledge the strong shareholder support for protecting the Arctic Refuge,&quot; said Amy Perry of Green Century Capital Management.  &quot;Drilling in the Arctic Refuge poses a significant risk to shareholder value, and we look forward to negotiating with Phillips Conoco on canceling their drilling plans.&quot;</font></p>
