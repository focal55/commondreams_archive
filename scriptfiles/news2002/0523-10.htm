Major 

Poultry Producers Go Cold Turkey, Pilgrim's Pride Fails to Follow</font></div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - For years chicken 

producers have laced the feed and water given to chickens with huge 

amounts of antibiotics, often for the sole purpose of speeding the 

animals' growth. But recent months have seen a dramatic change in 

the industry as several of the nation's largest chicken producers 

have announced they have reduced antibiotic use in healthy 

chickens. Unfortunately, the third largest U.S. chicken producer, 

Pilgrim's Pride, headquartered in Pittsburg, Texas, has made no 

statements about the antibiotic use, which threatens to undermine 

the efficacy of antibiotics in human medicine. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Perdue and other top chicken producers have proven that it's 

possible to maintain a healthy bottom-line while protecting human 

health,&quot; said Michael Khoo, an antibiotics expert at the Union of 

Concerned Scientists (UCS). &quot;Pilgrim's Pride should stop playing 

chicken with antibiotics and start following the leaders in the 

chicken industry.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UCS estimates that 70 percent of all antibiotics used in the 

United States are fed to chickens, pigs and cows for nontherapeutic 

purposes like growth promotion. The overuse of antibiotics in 

poultry production encourages disease-causing bacteria that can 

resist drug treatment. The American Medical Association has called 

for an end to the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in animal 

farming. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Smaller producers pioneered the move away from antibiotics, but 

this is the first time major chicken producers have acknowledged 

the antibiotic resistance problem,&quot; Khoo said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Top 10 U.S. chicken producers Perdue, ConAgra, Wayne Farms and 

Foster Farms, who produce a combined 142.23 million pounds of 

chicken per week, have moved to stop feeding medically important 

antibiotics to healthy chickens. A spokesman for Perdue has gone 

on-record saying that the company quit feeding antibiotics to 

healthy chickens so that, &quot;we are in no way, shape or form 

contributing to antibiotic resistance in humans.&quot; Pilgrim's Pride, 

which produces 56.7 million pounds of chicken per week has shown no 

sign of making a similar move. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As long as poultry companies continue to squander invaluable 

antibiotics, human diseases will continue to develop resistance to 

drug treatments,&quot; Khoo said. </font></p>
