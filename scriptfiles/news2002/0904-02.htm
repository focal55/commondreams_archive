- September 4 - The Vice President has once again refused to provide any

information about the role and influence CEOs of polluting energy companies

like Enron had in the Energy Task Force. The Sierra Club and Judicial Watch

have sued the Vice President and other Administration officials,

challenging the Administration's attempts to keep Energy Task Force

meetings with energy industry executives secret.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The American people are still waiting to find out what happened behind

closed doors when the Administration met with polluting energy companies to

form the nation's energy policy,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the

Sierra Club. &quot;As long as the Vice President continues to withhold

information, the public will remain in the dark about how much influence

these industries had in crafting our energy policy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In response to a federal court order and a September 3 deadline, the

Administration yesterday did release some information from federal agencies

(much of it already made public), but they continued their refusal to

disclose any information regarding the Vice-President. The Administration

instead filed a motion with the court seeking to insulate the Vice

President entirely from any discovery of information. The Administration

also took the unprecedented position of seeking to insulate entirely from

discovery lower-level staffers in the Administration. Through their

lawyers, they argued that the executive privileges of their office apply,

not only to information in their possession, but also to information known

or in the possession of lower-level officials such as defendants Andrew

Lundquist, Executive Director of the Cheney Energy Task Force and an Energy

Department employee; Larry Lindsey, Assistant to the President; and Joshua

Bolton, Assistant to the President.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club also believes that the Administration violated the order of

federal judge Emmet G. Sullivan by failing to provide &quot;detailed and precise

objections to particular requests&quot; for information. The judge had

specifically ordered the Administration not to make a blanket objection

based on &quot;general invocations of privilege.&quot; [Order of Judge Emmet

Sullivan, Aug. 2, 2002]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The public deserves to know how critical policy that affects our health

and safety, our energy needs and our economy was developed, and it's wrong

for Vice President Cheney to continue to hide this information,&quot; said Pope.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May, Vice President Cheney and other Administration Officials were

rebuffed by Judge Emmet Sullivan, who ruled from the bench against their

motions to dismiss the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch lawsuits. In August,

Judge Sullivan again rejected government arguments and approved in full the

&quot;discovery plan&quot; for information prepared by the Sierra Club and Judicial

Watch.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club suit asserts that by refusing to tell the public about the

influence energy industries had in crafting national energy policy, the

Cheney Task Force violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The

Sierra Club is asking the court to require Vice President Cheney and other

defendants to disclose to the American people what went on behind closed

doors in the creation of the national energy policy. The suit has been

consolidated with a similar suit filed by Judicial Watch.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The energy policy that ultimately came out of the Administration relies on

technologies that will pollute our air and water, destroy special places

and fail to reduce our dependence on oil and coal. At the very least, the

American people deserve an explanation of why the Administration chose this

path rather than safer and cleaner technologies that would protect the

environment and save consumers money at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club is asking for a full accounting of what happened behind the 

closed doors of the Cheney Energy Task Force, including: who was in the room; 

what proposals did the energy industry executives and lobbyists make; what documents 

did the energy industry submit; and what Task Force documents did they review.
