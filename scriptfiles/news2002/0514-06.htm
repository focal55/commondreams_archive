<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- May 14 - Global warming threatens 

to destroy critical polar bear habitat, according to a new study 

from World Wildlife Fund. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report Polar Bears at Risk reviews the threats faced by the 

world's 22,000 polar bears and highlights that human-induced 

climate change is the number one long-term threat to the survival 

of the world's largest terrestrial carnivores. The burning of coal 

and other fuels emits carbon dioxide and other gases that blanket 

the earth, trap in heat and cause global warming. According to the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change in 

the polar region is expected to be the greatest of anywhere on 

Earth. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The WWF report shows that polar bears in Hudson Bay are being 

impacted by climate change," said Lynn Rosentrater, co-author of 

the report and climate scientist at WWF's Arctic Program. "The 

polar bear's basis for survival is being threatened by the 

reduction of the sea ice. Since the sea ice is melting earlier in 

the spring, polar bears move to land earlier without having 

developed as much fat reserves to survive the ice-free season. They 

are skinny bears by the end of summer, which in the worst case can 

affect their ability to reproduce." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Increasing CO2 emissions have caused Arctic temperatures to rise 

by 5 degrees Celsius over the past 100 years, and the extent of sea 

ice has decreased by six percent over the past 20 years. By around 

2050, scientists now predict a 60 percent loss of summer sea ice, 

which would more than double the summer ice-free season from 60 to 

150 days. Sea ice is critical to polar bears' survival because it 

is the platform from where they hunt their primary prey - ringed 

seals and bearded seals. Diminishing ice cover and longer ice-free 

periods limit the time the bears have on the ice to hunt and means 

that they have fewer fat resources to survive during the longer 

summer season. In addition, lower body weight reduces female bears' 

ability to lactate, leading to greater mortality among cubs. Fewer 

than 44 percent currently survive the ice-free season. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to the rapid pace of change in the Arctic, there is no time 

to lose in reducing heat-trapping gases. Significant reductions can 

be achieved by using existing technologies to increase the energy 

efficiency of our homes, businesses and automobiles and utilizing 

clean renewable energy instead of dirty fossil fuels. Particularly, 

bipartisan support has grown in Congress for a renewable portfolio 

standard that would ensure that 20 percent of U.S. energy comes 

from renewable energy by 2020. President Bush has thus far been 

opposed to this proposal. World leaders will discuss a similar 

proposal at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in South 

Africa this summer. WWF calls on President Bush to support this 

initiative in Johannesburg. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Arctic nations that are home to most of the world's polar 

bears should be leading the charge against global warming," said 

Jennifer Morgan, director of WWF's Climate Change Program. 

"Instead, the United States -- the world's largest global warming 

polluter -- is essentially ignoring this problem. All eyes will be 

on President Bush at the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable 

Development in South Africa this August to test his commitment to 

sustainable energy solutions for climate change." 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impacts of global warming come on top of problems that polar 

bears face from hunting, toxic pollution and future oil 

developments in the Arctic. In some areas, research on polar bears 

shows a link between high contaminant levels and reduced immune 

system function. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WWF today unveils a new Web site (<a href="http://www.panda.org/polarbears" target="_new">http://www.panda.org/polarbears</a>) 

containing extensive information about polar bears and their Arctic 

domain. The site includes satellite tracking of two female bears 

(Louise and Gro) as they roam the ice pack in search of prey.
