MONICA, CA - July 26 - The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR) 

condemned legislation that would impose harsh new rules on consumers who file 

for bankruptcy, while big corporations are still afforded the traditional protections 

of bankruptcy. Congressional negotiators agreed yesterday on a credit card industry-sponsored 

bankruptcy bill that strips consumer protections for Americans struggling under 

the crush of credit card debt. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The big guys can file multi-billion 

dollar bankruptcies, but the rest of us can't get protection when we face difficult 

financial times,&quot; said Doug Heller, senior consumer advocate with FTCR. &quot;The 

hand of government is striking consumers, while criminal corporations like WorldCom, 

Enron and Adelphia receive the helping hand of bankruptcy protection.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FTCR called it ironic that the bankruptcy 

bill agreement was announced on the same day that Congress came to agreement on 

the corporate accountability legislation. The consumer group noted that the corporate 

reform bill was weak in the area of ensuring that workers, retirees and other 

investors are compensated for the losses they sustain when criminal corporations 

retreat into the safe-haven of corporate bankruptcy protection. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Not only do corporate scandals 

devastate average Americans' lives, the personal bankruptcies that ensue after 

a corporate collapse will be much more painful under this law,&quot; said Heller. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FTCR is calling on President Bush 

to reject the bankruptcy bill, which was sponsored by some of his largest campaign 

contributors in the credit card and banking industry. Under the bill, consumer 

credit cardholders will not be able to wipe the slate clean and start over, even 

though big corporations will continue to be allowed to pay pennies on the dollar 

for their debts once they declare bankruptcy. Bankrupt corporations even get special 

access to new credit once they file for bankruptcy protection, but average consumers 

will be left without a safe-harbor as a result of the new law. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;There is a double standard 

in Washington that says it's OK for corporations to get a full range of bankruptcy 

protections, but consumers should be left to struggle on their own. President 

Bush should veto this extremely unfair legislation,&quot; said Heller. </font></p>
