<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO - May 22 -  A new report on the economic status of women in California makes clear what far too many women know firsthand: it's a continual challenge-and not always possible-to make ends meet.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistics the report highlights are devastating. More than one in three single women and their dependent children-37%- are living in poverty. [The national poverty rate for single women is 25%; the overall poverty rate in California is 14%.] Nearly two in five Latinas, one in three Native American women, and one in four women of African descent-and their kids-don't have enough to eat. Nearly seven in 10 low-income people spend more than 70% of their income on housing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report, Failing to Make Ends Meet: A Report on the Economic Status of Women in California, marks the first time a foundation, organization, or policy institute has compiled the information and data available on how women are faring in California's current economy. The Report, developed by The Women's Foundation in collaboration with seven project partners, is being released today in Sacramento today, May 22, at 9:30 am.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By exploring the specific economic issues facing women in California, the Report provides a framework for analyzing the impact of Governor Davis's 2002-03 Revised Budget. Although the budget does provide a $20M partial restoration for California Community College CalWORKs program, increase funding for food assistance for legal immigrants, and sustain funding for some childcare programs, it also includes substantial cuts to vital health and human services programs as well as programs designed to provide housing assistance to those in greatest need (emergency and farmworker housing).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Recessions and shortfalls don't make for an easy budget process,&quot; said Patti Chang, President and CEO of The Women's Foundation. &quot;But to cut funding to the programs that can improve women's economic security is to balance the budget at women's expense.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analyzing women's economic status is important because women in California are over-represented in low-wage occupations and because women tend to have substantially less income than men. As a result, single women with children, women of color, and older single women are the most likely to be living in poverty.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This Report was issued on behalf of the women behind these statistics,&quot; said Elmy Bermejo, Chair, California Commission on the Status of Women, a project partner for the Report. &quot;It is now up to our elected officials and policy makers to support and advance the policies and programs that will directly improve these women's lives.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Report recommends, for example, that:<br>

To decrease the hunger experienced by women and children, California increase accessibility to its Food Stamps program. California provide partial funding for and leverage local and private funds to preserve &quot;at-risk&quot; housing - housing that is currently set-aside for low-income, elderly, and disabled persons. California pass living wage legislation. The legislature pass and the governor sign AB 692, which would allow eligible individuals to establish Individual Development Accounts for post-secondary education, first home purchases, major home repairs, and business capitalization. Californians should encourage US Senators and Representatives to support the passage of HR 4069, the &quot;Social Security Enhancements for Women Act,&quot; which would close the widow's gap by increasing benefits and expanding eligibility for elderly and disabled widows and divorced spouses. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No mother in California should have to choose between buying food for her children or paying her rent,&quot; said Diana Spatz, Founding Executive Director of the Oakland-based Low-Income Families' Empowerment through Education (LIFETIME).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Women's Foundation and its project partners would like to see the Report play a critical role in shaping state policies that improve women's economic status. &quot;Economic security is not the privilege of the wealthy,&quot; said Chang. &quot;It is what every woman in California deserves.&quot;</font></p>
