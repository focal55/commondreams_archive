- May 8 -  The U.S. House of Representatives voted today to accept President Bush's designation of Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the country's nuclear waste storage site. The House endorsed the measure 306 to 117. More than 100 Representatives voted to protect public safety and rejected enormous financial pressure from the nuclear industry.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The controversial project has been criticized by the General Accounting Office, which in December 2001 reported that there are 293 significant unresolved technical issues with the Yucca Mountain site. Subsequently, in a letter dated January 24, 2002, the presidentially appointed Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board advised Congress &quot;the technical basis for the Department of Energy's [Yucca] repository performance estimate is weak to moderate.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yucca Mountain itself is in a zone intersected by 33 earthquake faults and is situated above an aquifer, which provides the only source of drinking water for a nearby community. The project includes the proposed hauling of approximately 100 thousand shipments of highly radioactive nuclear waste from all across the country to Yucca Mountain. The waste would be shipped by truck, train and barge through America's communities and neighborhoods. In the end - because Yucca Mountain has limited capacity and waste will continue to be generated - the country would still be left with nearly the same amount of nuclear waste as exists today, at sites all across the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The passage of the Yucca Mountain resolution in the House clears the way for the Senate to deal with the Governor of Nevada's veto of the proposed site. The law requires a majority vote by both Houses of Congress in order to override Nevada's veto of the flawed Yucca Mountain project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his run for office, President Bush had made a campaign promise to designate Yucca Mountain only of the site was &quot;scientifically sound.&quot; So it was surprising to many observers when the President reneged on his promise and went ahead and designated the unsound Yucca Mountain project anyway. The much-criticized project has been shown to have less to do with sound science and more to do with political maneuvering than anything else. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is neither sound science nor sound policy - this is simply hoping that Americans are soundly asleep as the nuclear industry tries to pass this through Congress. </font></p>
