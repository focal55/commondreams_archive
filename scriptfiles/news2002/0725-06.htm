- July 25 - In its latest unconstitutional attack on women's health, the House 

of Representatives today passed yet another so-called partial-birth abortion ban. 

The American Civil Liberties Union called the passage of the deeply flawed legislation 

deplorable, saying it is overbroad, fails to include a health exception and will 

inevitably be struck down as unconstitutional. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Congress is thumbing its nose at the Supreme Court, which has made clear 

that legislation like this is unequivocally unconstitutional,&quot; said Laura 

W. Murphy, Director of the ACLU Washington National Office. &quot;Too often it 

seems that many of our lawmakers prefer the expedient political power play over 

the protection of women's health.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The House adopted the bill, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban of 2002 (HR 4965), 

by a vote of 274 to 151, a margin 13 votes slimmer than the bill's previous House 

version in 2000. President Clinton used his veto power to prevent the 2000 version 

from becoming law, a move that is not likely to be forthcoming from the current 

Bush White House. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Proponents of the legislation claim it would ban only a single, &quot;late 

term&quot; abortion procedure. In fact, the ACLU said the bill would outlaw a 

number of safe and common abortion procedures that are performed well before fetal 

viability. Perhaps worse, the ACLU said, the bill blatantly ignores the constitutional 

requirement that any law restricting abortion must contain an exception to protect 

the mother's health. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The need for a health exception was strongly reaffirmed by the United States 

Supreme Court when it struck down Nebraska's so-called partial-birth abortion 

ban in its 2000 ruling Stenberg v. Carhart. Supporters of the current legislation 

argue that it differs materially from its predecessor and should therefore be 

able to pass constitutional muster. The ACLU called this a &quot;pipe dream&quot; 

as it has blocked several other similar state bans in the courts. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notably, however, several House members who had voted in favor of the bill 

the last time around, including Reps. Joe Baca (D-CA), Thomas Barrett (D-WI) and 

Ron Kind (D-WI), voted against the measure today. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Supporters of this bill have been feeding lawmakers a steady diet of 

misinformation about this legislation,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;It looks like 

the truth - that this is a dangerous measure that could harm real women's lives 

- is making some inroads in Washington.&quot; </font> </p>
