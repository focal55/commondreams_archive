- April 30 -  The tobacco industry

contributed more than $4.3 million in soft money and political

action committee (PAC) contributions to federal candidates,

political parties and political committees so far this election

cycle -- from January 1, 2001, to April 1, 2002 -- according to a

quarterly report issued today by the National Center for

Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund and Common Cause.

<p>The report also details how political contributions continue to

correlate with lawmakers support of legislation supported by Philip

Morris and opposed by the public health community that would

provide for weak regulation of tobacco products by the U.S. Food

and Drug Administration (FDA).

<p>The report details the following tobacco industry contributions

so far in the 2001-2002 election cycle:

<p>-- Soft money and PAC contributions to federal candidates,

political parties and political committees totaled $4,311,473 since

January 1, 2001.

<p>-- Tobacco companies, along with tobacco company executives and

employees, donated more than $2.6 million in soft money to the

Democratic and Republican parties so far this cycle. Nearly 50

percent of these soft money donations came from Philip Morris.

<p>-- Tobacco company PACs donated over $1.1 million directly to

federal candidates, with 77 percent ($864,139) of the total

donations going to Republican candidates.

<p>-- Tobacco PACs have donated more than $560,000 to non-candidate

committees, including Democratic and Republican party committees

and leadership PACs established by individual members of Congress.

<p>The tobacco industry has contributed more than $20 million since

1997, including $13.2 million in soft money and $7.1 million in PAC

contributions. Since 1999, the four largest cigarette companies

have spent more than $44 million on lobbying the U.S. Congress.

<p>"The tobacco companies are continuing their decades-long effort

to use political muscle to avoid effective public policies that

protect the public health," said Matthew L. Myers, President of the

National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund. "Today's report

tells us why there has been no action on tobacco this election

cycle, despite the fact that thousands of kids start smoking every

day and 440,000 Americans die every year from tobacco use."

<p>Demonstrating how the tobacco industry's contributions are used

to thwart public health policy, the report details contributions to

the sponsors and cosponsors of ineffective FDA legislation

supported by Philip Morris.

<p>The 17 House members who are sponsoring the Philip Morris-backed

bill, H.R 2180, have received, on average, more than 19 times as

much money from the tobacco industry as the 117 sponsors of a

public health community-supported FDA bill, H.R.1097 ($10,357 vs.

$537).

<p>"It's no accident that this critical public health issue --

protecting children from a fatal illness -- is a low priority in

Congress. The tobacco industry's $4.3 million in contributions

protects their billions in profits at a major cost to public

health, and underlines the need for a ban on unlimited corporate

political contributions," said Scott Harshbarger, president of

Common Cause. "With passage of McCain-Feingold, we hope this issue

can be resolved on the merits, in favor of America's children."

<p>Campaign Contributions by Tobacco Interests is the latest issue

of a quarterly report that updates Buying Influence, Selling Death,

a major report on tobacco industry political influence that was

issued by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and Common Cause in

March 2001. All the contributions cited in this reported are

based on data released by the FEC as of March 31, 2002. The next

quarterly report will be released in July 2002.

<p>Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the

U.S., killing more than 440,000 Americans every year and causing

more than $155 billion in health care costs and lost productivity.

Ninety percent of smokers begin at or before age 18.

<p>This quarterly report's development and distribution are meant

to provide information and analysis on the tobacco industry's

extraordinary and improper political influence, especially in

regard to the U.S. Congress and the Federal Government. Toward

this end, this report offers a range of information, including data

on direct and indirect tobacco industry contributions to Members of

Congress, other elected officials, and other candidates for elected

office. Nothing in this report is meant in any way to endorse,

support, or oppose the election of any candidate or to indicate any

support or opposition to any candidate's election by any of the

sponsoring organizations.
