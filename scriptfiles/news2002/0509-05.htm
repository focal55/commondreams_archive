<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 9 -  In light of mounting 

evidence calling into question former Enron Executive Thomas 

White's credibility and conduct as Army Secretary, a group of 

national consumer and citizens groups today call upon President 

George W. Bush to take responsibility for his appointment and 

remove him from office. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Led by American Family Voices (AFV), the groups cited numerous 

conflicts of interest, questionable divesting practices, deceptive 

responses to Congressional inquiries, and pending FBI and DOD 

investigations as ample cause for his removal. Joining AFV with 

their concerns were Campaign for America's Future, and USAction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">White, an 11-year Enron executive, had previously headed Enron 

Energy Services before being appointed Army Secretary by Bush last 

year. White's department has been accused of misrepresenting 

earnings and misleading investors, contributing directly to the 

company's downfall. As Secretary, White continued to hold Enron 

stock and collect an Enron pension, even after promising 

legislators that he would divest himself completely. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. White has displayed an egregious lack of ethics while 

holding a public office,&quot; said William McNary, President of US 

Action. &quot;The honorable thing to do would be to return the profits 

he made back to the disenfranchised workers who were not privy to 

the same information Secretary White was.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Secretary White ran a Ponzi scheme at Enron, and walked away 

with millions while misleading investors and his own employees,&quot; 

said Robert Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America's Future. &quot;He is utterly incapable of representing the core military ethic of 

men and mission before self. It is time for the president to show 

that personal responsibility applies to members of his own 

administration.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Collectively, the groups represent millions of working families 

across the country. Each of the groups have been actively working 

following the collapse of Enron to make certain that the voice of 

the middle class is heard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Campaign for America's Future is a center of progressive ideas 

and organizing, joining citizen activists and policy experts to 

challenge the conservative drift of American politics, and to 

discuss and debate a new vision of an economy and a future that 

works for working families. </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>USAction is a grassroots consumer organization dedicated to 

winning social and economic justice for all. </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>American Family Voices (AFV) is an issue advocacy organization 

designed to focus attention on the economic and family issues most 

important to the quality of middle class working families' lives. 

AFV members include advocates for consumer, healthcare, education, 

children, seniors, civil rights and labor issues. </i></font></p>
