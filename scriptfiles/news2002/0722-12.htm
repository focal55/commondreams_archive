<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TEL AVIV - July 22 - Less 

than twenty-four hours ago, the Hamas leader Sheikh Ahamad Yassin made an unprecedented 

public call for a cease-fire with Israel. That call was the culmination of long, 

patient negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas leadership, 

aimed at achieving a ceasefire between the Palestinians and Israel, putting an 

end to suicide bombings and paving the way to a resumption of some kind of political 

process Saudi Arabia, too, is known to have made direct approaches to the Hamas 

leaders in order to achieve the same result. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A government of Israel caring 

even a little bit for the well-being of its own citizens would have welcomed the 

opening. Not so the Sharon Government, whose response was to send an F-16 fighter 

plane on a bombing spree in Gaza. The effect of attempting to assassinate a senior 

Hamas leader was a carnage whose victims included many women and children. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, instead of offers of 

ceasefire the Hamas leadership is coming out with calls for revenge, which seems 

to suit Sharon much better. It is the PM, with his endless string of provocations, 

who bears the responsibility for this missed opportunity of ending the cycle of 

bloodshed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deputy Defence Minister 

Dalia Rabin-Pelosof resigned this evening, charging the Sharon government with 

destroying the life work of the late Yitzchak Rabin, her father. </font></p>
