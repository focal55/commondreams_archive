- May 30 - The Washington Post 

reported May 30, 2002, that criminal defendants in Washington, 

D.C., are seeking to have the District's gun laws declared 

unconstitutional on Second Amendment grounds. The defendants are 

relying on the 180-degree shift in the Department of Justice's 

interpretation of the Second Amendment that was announced May 6, 

2002 in briefs filed in the U.S. Supreme Court. Mathew Nosanchuk, 

the Violence Policy Center's litigation director and legislative 

counsel, issued the following statement: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Solicitor General Theodore Olson filed briefs in the 

Supreme Court embracing the expansive individual rights 

interpretation of the Second Amendment, we warned that the primary 

beneficiaries of the Ashcroft Justice Department's novel 

interpretation would be criminal defendants. An expansive 

individual right under the Second Amendment simply is not supported 

by history of the Constitution or binding Supreme Court precedent 

and threatens to undermine the Justice Department's enforcement of 

existing gun laws. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now, the chickens have come home to roost. As the Washington 

Post today reported, the defendants are charged in separate cases 

with unlawful possession of a handgun and ammunition respectively. 

They both rely explicitly on the Justice Department's briefs -- and 

a memorandum from Attorney General Ashcroft to all 93 U.S. 

Attorneys in which he directs them to follow his interpretation of 

the Second Amendment-to support their Second Amendment challenges 

to the District's gun laws. According to the brief in one of the 

cases: 'As made clear by the various government representations, 

the United States now understands and represents before tribunals 

that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is an individual and 

personal right, not a collective right of the state to form a 

militia.' On this basis, the defendants seek to have the District's 

laws, which impose a virtual ban on the private possession of 

handguns and ammunition, struck down. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The reliance by criminal defendants on the Justice Department's 

new position puts the lie to the Justice Department's claim that it 

can be tough on gun crime and soft on the Second Amendment. Instead 

of promoting some abstract concept of constitutional law to score 

political points with the gun lobby, the Ashcroft Justice 

Department is handing criminal defendants arguments that will used 

to invalidate gun laws. The real-world implications of the 

Department's position make it clear that the Department will have 

to choose: protect public safety and security or implement an 

expansive individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment 

that gun criminals will use to their advantage.&quot; </font></p>
