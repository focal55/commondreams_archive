- May 6 - A coalition of non-wealthy 

voters, candidates, and public interest groups will file on Tuesday 

a constitutional challenge in federal court in Washington to the 

hard money limit increases in the recently-passed McCain-Feingold 

campaign reform law. The lawsuit will allege that the increases in 

the hard money contribution limits discriminate against non-wealthy 

voters and candidates based on their economic status in violation 

of the Equal Protection Clause in the United States Constitution. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plaintiffs include: non-wealthy voters and candidates from 

across the country; the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the 

organization which led the opposition to the hard money limit 

increases during the congressional debate on the law; the Fannie 

Lou Hamer Project, a grassroots organization redefining campaign 

finance as a civil rights issue; and ACORN, an advocacy 

organization on behalf of the poor, representing low and 

moderate-income voters throughout the nation. The Boston-based 

National Voting Rights Institute, which specializes in campaign 

finance litigation, serves as the lead counsel for the plaintiffs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and others have already filed 

challenges to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, alleging 

violations of the First Amendment. Sen. McConnell and others argue 

that corporations and wealthy donors should be permitted to 

make unlimited donations to political parties. In contrast, the 

plaintiffs in this new lawsuit support the ban on soft money but 

challenge, for the first time, the increases in the hard money 

contribution limits on equal protection grounds. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A special three-judge federal court has been assigned to hear 

all of these challenges, with direct review by the United States 

Supreme Court. These consolidated cases will mark the first time 

in 27 years that the Supreme Court will review the 

constitutionality of a campaign reform law passed by the U.S. 

Congress. Tomorrow's filing will ensure that the nation's highest 

court will hear arguments made on behalf of non-wealthy voters and 

candidates focusing on political equality principles grounded in 

the Equal Protection Clause. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For nearly three decades, federal campaign finance law has 

prohibited individuals from contributing more that $1,000 to a 

congressional or presidential candidate in any primary or general 

election. A provision of the McCain-Feingold law, known formally 

as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, raises individual limits to 

$2,000 per donor in federal races, thereby doubling the amount of 

hard money in the political system. Hard money accounts for more 

than 80 percent of the funds raised by federal candidates and 

parties and comes predominantly from the wealthiest one percent of 

the nation's population. A separate provision, the Millionaire 

Amendment, raises individual limits to the range of $6,000 to 

$12,000 per donor in races involving self-funded candidates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>NOTE TO PRESS: The plaintiffs and their attorneys will hold a 

press conference to announce this filing, and make the complaint 

available to reporters on Tuesday, May 7, at 10 a.m. in the West 

Room of the National Press Club in Washington. </i></font></p>
