<LI><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ELLEN FRANK, <A HREF="mailto:frank@emmanuel.edu"> 

frank@emmanuel.edu</A><BR>

Professor of economics at Emmanuel College in Boston and author of the forthcoming 

book <i>Money Illusions</i>, Frank said today: "For the last 10 years or so, the 

broad public has been encouraged, mostly because of 401(k) plans, to regard the 

stock market as a safe place to invest retirement funds and obtain consistently 

high, if occasionally volatile, returns. Small investors have been led to believe 

that a buy-and-hold strategy will yield a certain 7 percent return, when it almost 

certainly will not. Stock prices have risen faster than the economy, than sales, 

than corporate profits. This simply can't continue. Insiders have been bailing 

out, leaving small investors to suffer the losses. What the U.S. government should 

be doing is developing retirement programs that are safe, secure, stable and not 

dependent on stock returns. The decline is of course a compelling argument against 

Social Security privatization."</p> </font>

Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the author of the 

article "The Costs of the Stock Market Bubble," Baker said today: "The 1998-to-2000 

stock bubble was completely transparent to any economist or analyst who looked 

at it seriously. The public has every right to be scared about our political and 

economic leadership."</p> </font>

aplusd@tdl.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.dougdowd.org" target="_new">www.dougdowd.org</A><BR>

Dowd is author of the book <i>Understanding Capitalism</i> and the article "The 

New Economy: Stairway to the Stars or House of Cards?" He said today: "The stock 

market now is playing very much the same role it did in the late '20s; it got 

very seriously inflated then as it did the last five or six years. It's largely 

driven by euphoria. What has been keeping the economy going is debt -- household 

debt and international debt. The debt has to continue to rise for the economy 

to continue its course, but the debt can't continue to rise indefinitely. So much 

has been based on borrowing, borrowing, borrowing. It's likely that there will 

not be a panic just in the market, but throughout the economy."</p> </font>

Professor of economics at American University, Hahnel is author of <i>Panic Rules! 

Everything You Need to Know About the Global Economy</i> and the forthcoming <i>The 

ABC's of Political Economy</i>. He said today: "The essential problem is that 

we've tied the real economy of production and consumption -- which is what most 

of us care about -- ever more tightly to the fortunes of the financial sector 

that has been made much more volatile and crisis-prone by liberalization and deregulation 

of financial markets. While changes in the financial sector have provided new 

opportunities for speculators to increase their wealth, the increased fragility 

of the financial sector does great damage to the real economy. The depression 

in East Asia that followed the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 was one poignant 

example.... The problem is clearly not just evil CEOs; the regulatory framework 

dating back to the New Deal has been scuttled...."</p></p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
