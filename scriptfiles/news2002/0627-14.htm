<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- June 27 - Today environmentalists released an alarming report, Scorched Earth: 
Global Climate Change Impacts on Public Lands and Waters, demonstrating that global 
warming is one of the greatest threats ever faced by America&#8217;s national 
parks, wildlife refuges, marine sanctuaries, and forests.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, by Bluewater Network, cites rising temperatures as fueling more 
catastrophic wildfires and droughts, generating more haze and smog, displacing 
native wildlife and plants, and increasing the public&#8217;s risk of contracting 
diseases like malaria and Lyme disease. In conjunction with the report, Bluewater 
Network filed petitions with the Departments of Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce 
calling for prompt action to temper this impending disaster, citing federal mandates 
that require stewards of the nation's public lands to protect resources for future 
generations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Ironically, the world&#8217;s 
leading scientists have informed the public of the types of damages we should 
expect over the next 100 years&#8212;damages that threaten every ecosystem and 
species, including our own. Yet our land managers continue to plan only one to 
two decades into the future,&#8221; said Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater 
Network. &#8220;This is irresponsible and unlawful. Therefore, we are today submitting 
petitions to our land agencies to meet their legal and moral obligations by analyzing, 
planning for, and to the extent feasible, mitigating the very severe impacts of 
global warming.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of Congress joined 
Bluewater Network at a teleconference at 11:00 AM EST to discuss Scorched Earth. 
Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) called the report &#8220;shock therapy&#8221; for 
those refusing to do anything to address global warming. Congressman George Miller 
(D-CA) released a statement saying, &#8220;Americans should be alarmed and deeply 
troubled that United States is doing little to prevent these dramatic changes 
from occurring. Global Warming is not a theoretical issue. It is not a &#8216;maybe.&#8217; 
It is a reality.&#8221; On the teleconference Miller highlighted the impact to 
water resources in the West, where decreased snowpack could undermine the economy 
and potential for future growth.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report also received 
high praise at the teleconference from scientists James McCarthy, Ph.D., Professor 
of Biological Oceanography at Harvard University and co-chair of a workgroup of 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change whose task it was to assess impacts 
of and vulnerabilities to global climate change, and Paul Epstein, Ph.D., M.D., 
Associate Director, Harvard Medical School and author of the Health Section of 
the IPCC&#8217;s second climate change Assessment Report and the WHO/WMO/UNEP 
report Climate Change and Human Health.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Like a bear at a 
campsite, the oil industry is making a shambles of US energy policy while the 
White House turns a blind eye,&#8221; said Long. &#8220;Mr. Bush has a tough choice 
ahead&#8212;fighting to preserve the oil industry&#8217;s bottom line, or protecting 
the public land legacy created by Presidents Grant, Roosevelt and Wilson. Let&#8217;s 
hope he has the wisdom to choose correctly.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some specific impacts cited 
in the report include:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Increasing wildfires&#8212;the five-year average from 1996-2000 is 
the highest in forty years of record keeping. As of June, the National Interagency 
Fire Center declared the nation to be at Level 5 fire risk&#8212;the earliest 
that level has ever been reached.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; A sea level rise of up to 30-inches over the next century that will 
submerge much of the Everglades and Florida Keys, where large areas are less than 
three feet above sea level.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Loss of all of Glacier National Park&#8217;s glaciers within 28 years.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Snowpack loss at Tahoe National Forest, where two-thirds of the spring 
snowpack will threaten California&#8217;s water supplies and the winter recreation 
industry.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Loss of native forests across the nation, such as Great Meadows National 
Wildlife Refuge, Yosemite, and Alaska&#8217;s spruce forests, which may lose the 
majority of their native trees due to pestilence and higher temperatures.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Die-off of the majority of corals in the Florida Keys Marine Sanctuary 
by 2030.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Disappearance of ANWR&#8217;s entire North Slope tundra by 2100, with 
serious impacts to wildlife. Early onset of spring is already disrupting the caribou 
herd&#8217;s precisely-timed migration schedule, endangering its survival</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Transformation of a relatively benign mosquito-borne malaria parasite 
at Cape Cod National Seashore into a fully potent one, and a likely increase in 
Lyme disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Warming rivers and streams at Yosemite that will likely devastate 
whitefish, brook trout, and Chinook salmon.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; A warming in Yellowstone 
that will decimate the park&#8217;s whitebark pine habitat, endangering the park&#8217;s 
grizzly bears which rely on the forests for a major portion of their diet.</font></p>
