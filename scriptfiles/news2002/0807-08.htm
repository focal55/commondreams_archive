- August 7 - The Missouri Rural Crisis Center and the National Family Farm Coalition 

strongly condemned President Bush's recess appointment of Thomas Dorr to the position 

of Undersecretary for Rural Development in the USDA, and urged Sen. Tom Harkin 

(D-Iowa) to uphold his pledge to obtain USDA documents on Dorr's farming operations.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are outraged that President Bush appointed Thomas Dorr through this 

sneaky back door method, ignoring sixteen months of widespread grassroots opposition,&quot; 

said George Naylor, an Iowa farmer and leader of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. 

&quot;The President obviously knew that Dorr's record, statements and character 

would not stand up to a vote of the full Senate, just as it failed to win Senate 

Agriculture Committee approval last week.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We count on Senator Harkin to live up to his promise to obtain documents 

that the USDA withheld while this nomination was under consideration,&quot; said 

Bill Christison, Missouri farmer and President of the Missouri Rural Crisis Center 

and the National Family Farm Coalition. &quot;Now more than ever it is important 

to expose the unsuitability of this man for a high level job.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More than 165 grassroots groups have publicly opposed the Thomas Dorr nomination. 

The Senate Agriculture committee gave Dorr a vote of no confidence last week when 

it did not recommend the nomination.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This appointment will infuriate people all over the countryside,&quot; 

said Leon Crump, a South Carolina family farmer with the Federation of Southern 

Cooperatives. &#8220;President Bush and Secretary Venemen have proven with this 

appointment that they stand opposed to an economically and ecologically sustainable 

family farm system of agriculture, diverse rural communities, and fair access 

to rural development programs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opposition to Thomas Dorr is based on his support of corporate-controlled agriculture, 

opposition to sustainable agriculture and his view that ethnic diversity is an 

impediment to economic development. In a letter to Harkin read during his nomination 

hearing, Dorr revealed his disdain for rural residents who utilize government 

programs, the very people he will serve as Undersecretary for Rural Development.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, Thomas Dorr 

admitted he structured his farming operations to &quot;quite frankly </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">avoid 

minimum payment limitations.&quot; Dorr and Dorr family trusts were forced to 

repay $34,000 for two separate violations. Harkin revealed last Thursday that 

two Dorr family trusts received $65,000 in farm program payments from 1988 through 

1993 and could fall under the same circumstances. However, the USDA continues 

to withhold further Dorr farming operation records from the public and Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We will continue to pursue the lawsuit against the USDA to force the 

release of all Dorr operation farming documents,&#8221; said Dena Hoff, Montana 

farmer and North Plains Resource Council member. &#8220;Then everyone will know 

that Dorr is not qualified to represent family farmers or serve in public office.&#8221;
