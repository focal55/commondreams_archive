- April 24 - 

More than 20 of the

nation's leading conservation groups (see below) today sent

a letter to Congress urging lawmakers' opposition to legislation

that would allow the Department of Defense to ignore certain

environmental laws. The groups specifically oppose the exemption

language in the defense authorization bill, which they say contains

"broad sweeping exemptions...(that) would likely result in irreparabl

e harm to public health and the environment."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The American people have long supported these important

environmental and public health laws...While we support U.S.

military efforts to prepare for military action, such as efforts to

protect national security, additional exemptions are not necessary

to accomplish this goal. Many of these laws already have specific

provisions that allow requests by the Department of Defense for

waivers in the interest of national security...We firmly believe no

government should be above the law-including the laws that protect

the air and water in and around our military facilities, the health

of the people who live on bases and nearby, and America's wildlife

and public lands," the groups state in their letter.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the groups, changes allowing military exemptions

were proposed by the Department of Defense at the last minute,

without sufficient consideration. The groups also charge that many

public interest groups, the National Governors' Association, the

National Association of Attorneys General, and the National

Conference of State Legislatures were denied the opportunity to

testify at a hearing regarding DOD's environmental issues. They

support a process where all parties can work together on these

issues to develop creative and collaborative solutions.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among other damaging effects the legislation could have, the

groups highlight toxic contamination of air and water, destruction

of endangered species critical habitat, threats to migratory birds

and their nests, and harm to marine mammals. The groups claim that

this laundry list of exemptions is both damaging and entirely

unnecessary.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Our existing laws already provide the proper balance between

military readiness and environmental protection," today's letter to

Congress concludes. "Problems need to be addressed under our

current laws."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The military readiness subcommittee action on the legislation is

scheduled for this Thursday, from 11:30 to 1:30 in 2212 Rayburn

House Office Building.

</font>

by contacting Suzanne Carrier at Earthjustice, 202-667-4500, ext.
