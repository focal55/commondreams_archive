<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">COLUMBUS, 
GEORGIA - July 13 - Twenty-nine human rights activists were given sentences today 
ranging from three to six months in federal prison. Seven received six months 
probation. Fines ranged from none to $5000. Thirty-seven defendants had been in 
federal court all this week for civil disobedience at the School of the Americas 
(renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) in Columbus, Georgia. 
Ken Crowley was the first defendant called before the judge for sentencing. His 
attorney brought up the fact that the federal probation office had made a recommendation 
of 12 months probation and a $500 fine. Judge Faircloth ordered that none of the 
other probation office recommendations were to be talked about. It is believed 
that a majority of the defendants received the same recommendations.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eight of the defendants pled guilty 
to trespass on Monday. Ten pled not guilty while stipulating to the facts presented 
by the prosecution. Judge G. Mallon Faircloth found these ten guilty on Tuesday. 
Fourteen defendants were tried on Tuesday and Wednesday &shy; all found guilty 
with one exception. Five defendants who represented themselves were tried Thursday. 
All of the defendants (excepting the one acquitted) were sentenced yesterday afternoon 
well into the night.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 'SOA 37' were among 
10,000 who gathered last November to call for the closure of the notorious SOA/WHISC. 
The defendants peacefully crossed onto Ft. Benning, site of the school. Judge 
Faircloth is known for giving the maximum of six months to SOA/WHISC opponents. 
Seventy-one people have served a total of over forty years in prison for engaging 
in nonviolent resistance in a broad-based campaign to close the school. Last year 
26 people were prosecuted, including Dorothy Hennessey, an 88 year-old Franciscan 
nun who was sentenced to six months in federal prison.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Those who speak out for 
justice are facing harsh prison sentences while SOA-trained torturers and assassins 
are operating with impunity,' said SOA Watch founder Fr. Roy Bourgeois. Defendant 
Sr. Kathleen Desautels, a 64-year old nun added, 'The indignities I will have 
to experience in prison pale in comparison to what the victims of the graduates 
of that school had to endure.' </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SOA/WHISC is a combat training 
school for Latin American soldiers. Its graduates are consistently involved in 
human rights abuses. In 1996 the Pentagon was forced to release training manuals 
used at the school that advocated the use of torture, extortion and execution. 
In December 2000 Congress authorized the WHISC to replace the SOA. The renaming 
of the school was widely viewed as an attempt to diffuse public criticism and 
to disassociate the school from its reputation. SOA Watch maintains that the underlying 
purpose of the school, to control the economic and political systems of Latin 
America by aiding and influencing Latin American militaries, remains the same.</font></p>
