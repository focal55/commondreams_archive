Associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Physicians 
for a National Health Program, Himmelstein said today: "The Pfizer buyout of Pharmacia 
announced today is the industry's response to the reality that they have very 
little in the pipeline in terms of new products. Drug firms still have the highest 
profit margins of any industry, but that is beginning to wane. The industry has 
spent the last decade basically buying innovation from academia. Research has 
focused on what's profitable in the short run and less and less on the necessary 
science for future innovation. Companies now want to corner the market as a way 
to deal with the fact that their profits are dropping."</p> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Tangri is with Essential Action, an international anti-corporate campaigning group, 
and South Asians for Community Action. He said today: "While everyone in the U.S. 
is currently talking about corporate financial crimes, there should be more open 
discussion about corporate crimes that kill people. In 1984, a Union Carbide factory 
in Bhopal, India, leaked a deadly gas because safety features were disabled as 
part of an effort to cut costs. Almost 18 years later, after 20,000 people have 
died, compensation money has not been fully distributed. In a case to be decided 
this Wednesday, the Indian government, under pressure from Dow, is moving to drop 
the criminal charges and dilute the already paltry victims' compensation fund 
by using it instead for cleanup -- in effect making the victims pay. Two survivors 
and a medical worker are going into their 18th day of a hunger strike to demand 
just compensation and extradition of the CEO. One of the hunger strikers, Rashida 
Bi, lost five members of her family while the other, Tara Bai, lost the child 
she was carrying. If charges are dropped, it will establish a terrible precedent 
-- that corporations can get away with murder."</p> </font>

Harrell is a toxics campaigner with Greenpeace USA. He said today: "The Indian 
government is under pressure from Dow Chemical, Carbide's new owner, to reduce 
the charges against then-CEO Warren Anderson.... Dow must continue to be held 
liable for the cleanup and ongoing disaster in Bhopal as hundreds of thousands 
continue to suffer from the grave ill effects of one of the worst incidents of 
industrial pollution."</p> </font>

Wilson, who runs a shrimp boat in a Texas bay that Dow pollutes, has traveled 
to Bhopal to testify against the company. Tomorrow she will start a hunger strike 
at the Dow plant in Seadrift, Texas. She said today: "We are all human beings 
on this one planet. It's outrageous that the lives of people in India are so devalued."</p></p>
