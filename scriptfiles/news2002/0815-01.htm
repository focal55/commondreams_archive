- August 15 - On Friday, August 16, the Marijuana Policy Project<br>

(MPP) will file formal papers asking the District of Columbia Board of Elections 

and Ethics (BOEE) to reconsider its decision not to certify Initiative 63, the 

Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002, for the November ballot. At an 11:00 a.m. 

press conference in front of the BOEE's offices, MPP Executive Director Robert 

Kampia and other speakers will present evidence of massive errors by the BOEE's 

staff, which resulted in the rejection of thousands of valid petition signatures.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Initiative petitions must contain valid signatures from five percent of the 

District's registered voters, and that total must include five percent of voters 

from at least five of the city's eight wards. There is no dispute that the more 

than 18,000 signatures accepted by the Board met the citywide requirement, but 

the BOEE claimed that MPP had presented enough valid signatures from only four 

of eight wards. Since then, MPP has identified thousands of valid signatures that 

were wrongly rejected as not belonging to registered voters -- enough to surpass 

the five percent requirement in at least six wards.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> One of those voters, Sanho Tree (who was interviewed on the July 30 ABC News 

special &quot;War on Drugs, A War on Ourselves&quot;), will speak at the press 

conference. &quot;I've been a registered voter in the District for 14 years,&quot; 

Tree said. &quot;For the Board to throw out my signature because I'm `not registered' 

is appalling, and it's clear I'm just one of many the Board has disenfranchised.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WHO: MPP Executive Director Robert Kampia, MPP Director of Government Relations 

Steve Fox, Sanho Tree</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WHAT: Press conference to announce filing of &quot;motion to reconsider&quot; 

with the Board of Elections and Ethics</font></p>

Street NW, followed by the delivery of the motion in Suite 250-North</font></p>

marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended 

to prohibit such use. In association with Students for Sensible Drug Policy, MPP 

will hold its first national conference -- featuring a special appearance by comedian 

Bill Maher -- on Nov. 8-10 in Anaheim, California. For more information, see <a href="http://www.mpp.org" target="_new">http://www.mpp.org</a>
