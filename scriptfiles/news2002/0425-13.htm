<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 25 - The long-awaited energy

bill passed by the Senate today is "far less notable for what it

does than what it doesn't do," according to the National Wildlife

Federation (NWF).

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's great that the bill doesn't contain misguided plans to

drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge," said NWF Senior Vice

President Jamie Rappaport Clark. "But unfortunately it doesn't

contain any path to a sustainable energy future either."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The greatest flaws in the Senate bill are its failure to

aggressively promote renewable energy use and the absence of

increased Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards, especially for

gas-guzzling, but hot-selling sport utility vehicles and light

trucks.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Senators had a chance to make gas guzzling vehicles more

efficient, but they surrendered to industry scare tactics," noted

Clark. "They had the chance to leap forward on renewables, but they

took only tiny steps. And instead of improving hydropower licensing

to benefit our waterways and fisheries, they just made the process

more complex and less likely to safeguard important resources."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hidden among the bill's weak or troubling provisions are a few

bright spots relating to global warming. The measure takes initial

steps to hold industry accountable for greenhouse gas pollution and

encourages the President to become more engaged in developing real

solutions to the climate change problem, both domestically and

through participation in international agreements.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Senate Bill is certainly an improvement on the industry

payoff plan approved in the House but that's not really saying much

for it, added Clark.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step for the bill is a House-Senate conference

committee to reconcile disappointing Senate measure with the House

disaster.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A conference committee collapse might be the best thing that

could happen for America's energy policy. Congress and the White

House need to scrap the poor excuses they're offering as energy

plans and start again." continued Clark."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Wildlife Federation will continue the fight to

ensure that misguided approaches to meeting the nation's energy

needs don't further damage sensitive landscapes, threaten wildlife

or degrade the environment. Currently, administrative decrees

issued by President Bush's political appointees are quietly

undermining environmental safeguards to accelerate the pace of

risky energy development efforts, especially in the West.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"It's clear that administration and Congress aren't fully

grasping the message the public sent during the Arctic debate,"

concluded Clark. "Wasteful energy policies are no excuse for

auctioning off our natural heritage. People want a plan that helps

break our oil-addiction and gets America on track to a sustainable

future. Politicians are hearing that message from people of every

political persuasion. Politicians who don't listen will eventually

have to explain why."
