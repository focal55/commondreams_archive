<div align="center">Humane Society Says Evidence Of Meat From Endangered Whale Species In Japanese Markets Underscores Need To Continue Moratorium On Commercial Whaling</div>

- May 20 - As the International 

Whaling Commission (IWC) continues its 54th annual meeting in 

Shimonoseki, Japan, evidence that meat from endangered species of 

whales can be found in Japanese markets was presented by New 

Zealand researchers at the meeting of the Scientific Committee. 

Results from DNA tests on whale meat showed that endangered sei, 

humpback, and fin whales are making their way to the Japanese 

public for sale as food. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan is pushing for an end to the 15-year international 

moratorium on commercial whaling. The country currently operates a 

&quot;scientific&quot; whaling program. Scientific whaling is allowed under 

IWC rules; however, due to its questionable scientific merit and 

the resulting whale meat ending up for commercial sale, the 

Commission has issued resolutions condemning Japan's program as an 

abuse of the provision. Each year Japan hunts and kills 540 minke, 

50 Bryde's and 10 sperm whales in the name of science, claiming 

that the killing is necessary to collect information about the 

whales. This year they seek to expand this program to include 50 

endangered sei whales. Meat and blubber from the hunts are sold in 

Japanese restaurants and supermarkets, leading many to insist that 

the program is a screen for commercial whaling. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Naomi Rose, marine mammal scientist for The Humane Society 

of the United States, says, &quot;The DNA test results demonstrate that 

a 'legal' market for whale meat can be a shield for illegal kills 

of endangered species. If the moratorium on commercial whaling is 

lifted, more endangered whales will be killed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The HSUS is also praising the IWC member countries that voted to 

uphold a ruling rejecting Iceland's membership to the Commission 

and maintaining that nation's observer status in the meeting. When 

the commercial whaling ban was passed in 1982, Iceland could have 

taken a reservation on the decision, exempting it from the 

moratorium. But Iceland accepted the moratorium and abided by it 

until, tired of waiting for it to be lifted yet without immediate 

plans to return to whaling, the country quit the IWC in the early 

1990's. Last year and again this year, Iceland sought member 

reinstatement, but now with a reservation on the whaling ban 

because certain Icelanders do wish to return to commercial whaling. 

In short, Iceland wants to rejoin the IWC but be able to ignore the 

moratorium on commercial whaling. The attempt to circumvent the 

moratorium was defeated by a vote of 25 to 20. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Rose stated, &quot;Not allowing Iceland to rejoin the IWC with a 

reservation is a victory for everyone concerned, not just for the 

IWC treaty but for all treaties. Allowing Iceland to rejoin with a 

reservation against the moratorium would have set a terrible 

precedent. If you don't like a provision in a treaty, even if you 

accepted it initially, quit! Then after a few years have passed, 

rejoin and exempt yourself from the provision you didn't like!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Rose points out that there are very few reliable statistics 

on whale populations. There is a large discrepancy between current 

population estimates for the Antarctic population of minke whales 

and the last estimate generated in the late 1980's, for example. 

Originally believed to number 760,000, the latest Antarctic minke 

whale estimate now stands at 312,000. The reasons for this 

discrepancy aren't clear. But, says Dr. Rose, &quot;it certainly 

indicates that we aren't sure of their numbers and that trying to 

put in place a quota for the purposes of commercial whaling could 

do irreparable harm to this and other species.&quot; </font></p>

animal protection organization with more than six million members
