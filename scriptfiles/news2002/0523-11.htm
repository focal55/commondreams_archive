<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - This morning in Washington, DC more

than a dozen Senators announced their priorities for

welfare reform legislation, which will be debated in

the Senate this summer. Senators from the Health,

Education, Labor, and Pensions (H.E.L.P.) Committee

and others, including California Senator Barbara

Boxer, signed on to a letter to the Chair and Ranking

Member of the Senate Finance Committee calling for

legislation that lifts people out of poverty. The

Senators who signed the letter include Edward Kennedy

(D-MA), Paul Wellstone (D-MN), John Edwards (D-NC),

Patty Murray (D-WA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Barbara Boxer

(D-CA), Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Jeff Bingham (D-NM),

John Corzine (D-NJ), Carl Levin (D-MI), Patrick Leahy

(D-VT), Charles Schumer (D-NY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, the House of Representatives passed HR4737,

an extreme welfare reform bill opposed by moderates of

both parties, including many of the nation&#146;s

Republican governors. The bill is similar to the

welfare proposal unveiled by President Bush in

February. Among its most objectionable provisions, the

bill drastically increases work requirements for

welfare recipients while providing little funding for

work supports like childcare and transportation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a letter to their colleagues, H.E.L.P. Committee

Senators expressed concern about the House welfare

bill: &quot;The House bill provides only modest increases

for work supports, such as child care.  The

Congressional Budget Office estimates that childcare

costs under the House bill will be $4.9 billion over

five years.  Yet, the House bill provides only $2.9

billion a year in childcare spending, a $1 billion

increase over five years. Level-funding, strict work requirements, and inadequate work supports are particularly troublesome in a weak economy and job market.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senators hope to pass welfare legislation that

allows training and education to be counted toward

TANF work requirements, increases childcare funding

levels by an additional $11.25 billion over the next

five years, keeps the work requirement for TANF

recipients at 30 hours per week, and restores benefits

to legal immigrants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is the first time that Congress has re-authorized

TANF, Temporary Aid to Needy Families, since President

Bill Clinton ended &quot;welfare as we know it&quot;

four-and-a-half years ago. The dramatic changes to

welfare that kicked in at that time included a

five-year lifetime limit on cash aid to adults with

children, a stringent work requirement, and the

elimination of benefits for legal immigrants.</font></p>
