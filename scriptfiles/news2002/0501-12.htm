<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HONOLULU, HI - May 1 - The Sierra Club today applauded the Hawaii State Legislature

for approving the first 5-cent beverage container deposit legislation, or

bottle bill, in twenty years.  Hawaii is the 11th state with a bottle bill.

With all of the main Hawaiian Islands currently facing a landfill crisis,

this measure will shrink landfills, create recycling jobs, and vastly

reduce bottle and can litter from beaches and roadways.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Passing the bottle bill is a major victory for Hawaii's environment.

Hawaii is paradise. We want to keep it that way,&quot; said Jeff Mikulina,

Director of the Sierra Club, Hawaii Chapter.  &quot;With shrinking landfill

space and an economy that is dependent on a clean environment, the bottle

bill makes sense for Hawaii.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hawaii uses approximately 800 million beverage containers annually.

Currently, about 20% of those containers are recycled statewide. A recent

national report, co-sponsored by the beverage industry, found that states

with bottle bills recover 80% of their beverage container waste. Studies

also show that states with bottle bills witnessed a 60-80% decrease in

beverage container litter after enactment of the measure. Hawaii's bottle

bill will place a nickel deposit on all glass, plastic and aluminum

beverage containers that would be returned when the consumer brings the

empty container back for recycling. Redemption centers and retail stores

over a certain size would be required to accept the recyclable bottles and

cans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bottle bills work,&quot; continued Mikulina. &quot;They provide a real incentive for

people to recycle-and an incentive not to litter. The ten states with

bottle bills found that bottle and can litter has virtually disappeared.

With the bottle bill, we will not only reduce the pressure on our

landfills, but we will also improve the safety of our beaches and protect

our ocean ecosystem.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last states to pass nickel deposit bottle bills were Delaware and

Massachusetts in 1982. The many measures introduced by states since then

have been vigorously opposed by the beverage industry. Over the past 20

years, beverage industry opponents have spent tens of millions on defeating

bottle bills around the country, out spending proponents by as much as 30

to 1. In 1996, $3 million was spent to defeat a bottle bill expansion

initiative in Oregon. It is estimated that the beverage industry spent

upwards of $100,000 attempting to stop the Hawaii bottle bill.
