- August 7 - The Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) is considering its legal options 

after the Washington, D.C., Board of Elections and Ethics (BOEE) refused to correct 

its erroneous omission of thousands of valid signatures for Initiative 63, the 

Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002.</font>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Board has acted capriciously and unfairly,&quot; said MPP Executive 

Director Robert Kampia. &quot;We presented clear evidence of massive errors by 

the Board's staff, but the Board refused to use its discretion to uphold the will 

of D.C. voters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Initiative petitions must contain valid signatures from five percent of the 

District's registered voters, and that total must include five percent of voters 

from at least five of the city's eight wards. There is no dispute that the more 

than 18,000 signatures accepted by the Board met the citywide requirement, but 

the BOEE claimed that MPP had presented enough valid signatures from only four 

of eight wards. In Ward 4, the board claimed MPP fell approximately 100 signatures 

short.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But MPP's review of the Board's work found that massive numbers of valid signatures 

had been falsely ruled invalid. An analysis of nearly 4,000 allegedly bad signatures 

found that at least 15 percent were clearly valid.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Kampia and MPP Director of Government Relations Steve Fox met with Registrar 

Kathy Fairley prior to the Board's deliberations and presented her with the results 

of the MPP's analysis. After reviewing a sample of petitions, Fairley agreed that 

a large number of perfectly good signatures had been erroneously disallowed -- 

and reported that finding to the board.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> But rather than owning up to the massive errors and extrapolating the results 

of MPP's analysis, BOEE Chairman Benjamin F. Wilson insisted that MPP must either 

verify each and every falsely invalidated signature -- a project that would cost 

the nonprofit group approximately 400 person-hours of staff time, on top of the 

100 hours already spent identifying and correcting the Board's mistakes -- or 

trust the same staff that made the errors in the first place to re- check their 

work.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is outrageous,&quot; Kampia said. &quot;Whether out of malice or 

simple incompetence, the Board screwed up, and now they insist that our staff 

and members must shoulder the burden of fixing their mistakes. That's not acceptable. 

The Board of Elections and Ethics has fraudulently disenfranchised thousands of 

District voters and then refused to take responsibility for its actions. We didn't 

pick this fight, but we will win it.&quot;</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The Marijuana Policy Project works to minimize the harm associated with 

marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended 

to prohibit such use. In association with Students for Sensible Drug Policy, MPP 

will hold its first national conference -- featuring a special appearance by comedian 

Bill Maher -- on Nov. 8-10 in Anaheim, California. For more information, please
