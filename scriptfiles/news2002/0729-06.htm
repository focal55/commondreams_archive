- July 29 - The Sierra Club expressed strong disappointment today after the House 

of Representatives narrowly approved dangerous trade legislation. By a razor-thin 

margin of 215-212, and only after a rare lobbying visit to Capitol Hill by President 

Bush, the House passed the fast track bill, which will prevent Congress from fixing 

future trade deals, even when they threaten the environment.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now more than ever, Americans 

want Congress to hold corporations accountable, not give them more breaks,&quot; 

said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;The House's capitulation 

to powerful business interests could jeopardize many of the environmental protections 

Americans take for granted.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fast track will allow the Bush administration 

to extend NAFTA across the western hemisphere. Provisions in NAFTA allow foreign 

corporations to sue the U.S. government whenever they feel that our environmental 

protections affect their profits. Already, a Canadian chemical company has used 

NAFTA to sue the US government for $1 billion, jeopardizing a vital California 

clean water law. Extending NAFTA would greatly increse the number of these claims, 

and threaten crucial environmental and public health laws.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Here in California, we fought 

hard to keep our drinking water safe from dangerous toxic chemicals. But that 

progress could be undone by NAFTA's corporate-friendly provisions,&quot; continued 

Pope. &quot;Now thanks to the House vote, many more environmental protections 

across the country could soon be under attack.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rejecting fast track would not have 

limited our ability to enter international trade agreements. It simply would have 

allowed Congress to weigh in on those agreements, to prevent them from running 

roughshod over the environment. That safeguard no longer exists.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We can have a trade policy 

that is clean, green, and fair, but not by handcuffing our elected representatives,&quot; 

added Pope. &quot;The Bush administration now must take care not to put international 

trade on a collision course with the need to protect our environment.&quot; </font></p>
