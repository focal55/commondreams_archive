- July 9 -  "With the intent of
injecting inflammatory rhetoric into an election year and eroding
the protections of Roe v. Wade, anti-choice lawmakers are yet again
pushing an unconstitutional bill banning abortion procedures,"
stated NARAL President Kate Michelman. Today members on the
Constitution Sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee held a
hearing on HR 4965: the "Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2002,"
introduced by Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio).
<p>"Congressman Chabot's bill contains the very same constitutional
flaws struck down by the Supreme Court in Stenberg v. Carhart. The
bill imposes an undue burden on the woman, does not include a
health exception, or does it identify the specific procedure it
seeks to ban." Michelman continued, "It revives inflammatory
rhetoric by using graphic images, sensationalized language and
misinformation to strip the protections of Roe v. Wade."
<p>"For the fifth unsuccessful time in seven years, anti-choice
members are playing politics with women's lives, health and
safety," stated Michelman. "They continue to try to find ways to
further their agenda of using the government to make abortion
illegal and unavailable through this deceptive and unconstitutional
legislation."
<p>Respected medical organizations, including the American College
of Obstetrician and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's
Association and the American Nurses Association, among others,
oppose these bans. Michelman concluded, "Apparently, anti-choice
members believe politicians are better suited to advise American
women on private, safe medical care."
<p>"This so-called 'partial-birth' abortion ban is nothing short of
a political stunt to shift the focus from the fact that women, not
the government, should make medical decisions. Fortunately, the
Supreme Court has a precedence of putting personal privacy above
politics."</p>
