<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - The Brady Campaign to 

Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March, today 

praised Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) for introducing legislation 

to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 

(NICS) by requiring states to provide the FBI with all relevant 

records necessary to conduct criminal background checks, including 

mental health records. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Once again, we applaud Carolyn McCarthy for proposing concrete 

steps to make America more safe,&quot; said Michael D. Barnes, president 

of Brady Campaign. &quot;We know that background checks work when it 

comes to keeping guns away from criminals, terrorists and other 

prohibited purchasers. Expanding the scope of the NICS will greatly 

enhance the effectiveness of the system and, if enacted, this 

measure would certainly result in saved lives. &quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brady Campaign is endorsing H.R. 4757, which would also 

establish a nationwide grant program to state law enforcement 

agencies and state courts to automate and transmit records for 

inclusion in the federal instant background check database. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Barnes expressed some skepticism, however, at Rep. John 

Dingell's (D-Mich.) sudden interest in strengthening a so-called 

gun control measure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given Dingell's extreme record against sensible gun laws, 

including voting against both the Brady Law and the Assault Weapons 

Ban, one has to be suspicious of his motives,&quot; said Barnes. &quot;Is 

this sudden change of heart because Congressional re-districting 

has Mr. Dingell facing Congresswoman Lynn Rivers -- a supporter of 

common-sense gun policy -- in a competitive primary? Is this merely 

a thinly-veiled attempt by Dingell to appear moderate in a new 

district where polls indicate that the voters value sensible gun 

laws? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Michigan voters beware: consistent action speaks louder than 

words. John Dingell has repeatedly opposed virtually every effort 

to strengthen our nation's gun laws. If Dingell is sincere in his 

support for this measure, then he should commit to, and work for, 

other strong gun violence prevention measures from this point 

forward.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On a separate note, Barnes noted that Dingell's support of a gun 

control measure in the heat of his primary race, as well as Mayor 

Ed Rendell's primary victory in the Pennsylvania Governor's race, 

directly contradict recent press reports that Democrats are not 

talking about gun violence prevention in their campaigns because it 

is perceived as a losing issue. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rendell won his primary by 12 points, despite an aggressive 

negative advertising campaign launched by the National Rifle 

Association. Sarah Brady campaigned for Rendell, including 

recording a voice message on Rendell's strong record on gun 

violence prevention that reached more than 10,000 Pennsylvania 

homes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Highlights of John Dingell's dangerous record on guns - 

-- Voted against the Brady Bill to require a five-day waiting 

period before purchase of a handgun to allow for a background check 

of the purchaser. (H.R. 1025, Vote 564, 11/10/93) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Worked to weaken federal firearm laws. Under the guise of 

&quot;closing the gun show loophole,&quot; Dingell opposed comprehensive 

efforts to close the gun show loophole and he sought to undermine 

law enforcement efforts by reducing the amount of time they have to 

conduct background checks. (See additional details below.) (H.R. 

2122, Vote 234, 6/17/99) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Opposed the Assault Weapons Ban. Even though the measure was 

supported by law enforcement across the country, he voted against 

the federal Assault Weapons Ban which makes it unlawful to 

transfer, sell, or possess any of 19 types of assault weapons and 

large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. He called the 

legislation &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;obnoxious.&quot; (H.R. 4296, Vote 156, 

5/5/94; Chicago Tribune, 8/23/94) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Voted to repeal the Assault Weapons Ban. When Congress 

considered repealing the Assault Weapons Ban, he turned his back on 

law enforcement once again and toed the gun lobby line with a vote 

in favor of repealing this critical law. (H.R.125, Vote 92, 

3/22/96) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- He has called our dedicated federal law enforcement officers 

at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms &quot;a jack-booted group 

of fascists.&quot; (Quoted by NRA Executive Vice President Wayne 

LaPierre in Guns, Crime and Freedom) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional Details on Dingell's 1999 Gun Show Amendment: 

In 1999, barely two months after the Littleton school massacre, 

Dingell worked with gun lobby allies in the House leadership to 

thwart Rep. McCarthy's efforts to close the gun show loophole. He 

offered an amendment that, instead of effectively closing the 

loophole, would have weakened existing laws. The amendment was 

approved, but, thankfully, the bill to which the amendment was 

attached never passed the House. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, federally licensed firearm dealers (FFL's) at gun 

shows submit prospective purchasers names to the Instant-Check 

system and, although 95 percent of purchasers are approved in less 

than two hours, the system does allow three days for further 

checking of purchasers whose records indicate a problem. Under the 

1999 Dingell amendment, both FFL's and unlicensed sellers would 

have been able to sell firearms to anyone who cannot be 

conclusively declared a prohibited purchaser within 24 hours. The 

FBI estimated at the time that, if the background check process had 

been limited to 24 hours for FFL's in the six months prior to the 

vote on the Dingell Amendment, at least 17,000 felons would have 

walked away with their legally-purchased guns. </font></p>
