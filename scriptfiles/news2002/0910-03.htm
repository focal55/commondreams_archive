YORK - September 10 - Gov. Jeb Bush&#146;s daughter was found with cocaine at a rehabilitation 

              center where she is undergoing drug treatment, according to a recent 

              Associated Press report from Orlando. Her anticipated arrest comes 

              even as the Bush administration is spending millions of taxpayer 

              dollars in television and print advertisements suggesting that non-violent 

              Americans who use drugs are responsible for funding terrorism. </p>

            <p>Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Alliance, made the following 

              statement today from New York:</p>

            <p>&#147;Noelle has a problem with drugs. What she needs is help. 

              If one form of treatment does not work, the answer is not prison, 

              but to try another form of treatment, and if that doesn't work, 

              then another form again. Think about this as a medical problem, 

              or a psychological problem. No one &#145;treatment&#146; approach 

              works for everyone. Unless Noelle actually harms others or puts 

              others at great risk, such as by driving under the influence of 

              drugs, prison is not an appropriate response -- and is likely to 

              make matters worse, not better.</p>

            <p>&#147;What is particularly galling is that her father has done 

              little more than give lip service to the need for treatment for 

              others. Governor Bush has actively opposed the &#145;treatment instead 

              of incarceration&#146; initiative that will likely be on the Florida 

              ballot in 2004. Meanwhile, her uncle in the White House is giving 

              speeches and using taxpayer dollars to pay for ads saying that young 

              people like Noelle are subsidizing terrorism.</p>

            <p>&#147;One can only hope that Noelle's difficulties will open her 

              family's eyes to more compassionate and humane ways of dealing with 

              substance misuse both in their family and beyond.&#148;</p>

            <p>President Bush, when signing the Drug-Free Communities act last 

              December said: &#147;Drug use threatens everything, everything that 

              is best about our country&#133; If you quit drugs, you join the 

              fight against terror in America.&#148; In one government commercial, 

              smoking marijuana was equated with killing an innocent family. And 

              just this month the Drug Enforcement Administration opened a special 

              &#147;drugs and terrorism&#148; exhibit in their museum that exploitatively 

              features an actual piece of the World Trade Center -- even though 

              the tragic events of September 11th had nothing to do with drugs. 

            </p>

            <p>The Drug Policy Alliance continues to support Florida Governor 

              Jeb Bush&#146;s appeal for respect and privacy in coping with his 

              daughter&#146;s substance abuse problem. But the Alliance also pointed 

              out the sharp discrepancy in Florida&#146;s treatment of drug abuse 

              among people with less political power and financial means.</p>

            

<p align="left">For the past ten years more inmates have been admitted to Florida 

state prisons for drug offenses than for any other charge. The state&#146;s voters 

will likely have an opportunity to vote on a ballot initiative in 2004 to provide 

treatment instead of incarceration for the thousands of people who, like Noelle 

Bush, have substance abuse problems. The initiative would provide drug treatment 

for an estimated 10,000 non-violent Floridians per year who otherwise would be 

incarcerated. To date, Governor Bush has expressed staunch opposition to the possible 

initiative. Governor Bush has also cut drug treatment and drug court budgets in 

the state.</p>
