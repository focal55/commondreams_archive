<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 19 - Members 
of Congress joined consumer, environmental and public interest groups at a press 
conference today in response to the naming last week of conferees in the U.S. 
House of Representatives for upcoming House-Senate negotiations on energy legislation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Press conference participants 
demanded that the conferees not sell out the American public as proposed by House 
energy legislation, which offers nearly $34 billion in tax breaks and subsidies 
to wealthy and polluting oil, nuclear and coal companies. Nearly a dozen lawmakers 
stressed the importance of prioritizing people over wealthy corporations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;One provision in the 
House bill would let companies that want to drill for oil and gas in the federal 
waters of the Gulf of Mexico forego paying royalties to the American people. The 
owners of these resources, the American people, get nothing. Zero. Zilch. That 
is unacceptable,&quot; said Rep. Nick Rahall, ranking Democrat on the House Committee 
on Resources. &quot;If you are an executive of a major oil company, you would 
love the House energy bill. But if you are just plain folks, a person who pays 
for gas for your vehicle, you have to wonder why you should be gouged twice &#8211; 
at the pump and at the U.S. Treasury.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress is currently struggling 
to find an additional $7 billion dollars to fund the commitments it made recently 
in the education reform bill. It will also need between $350 and $700 billion 
for a Medicare prescription drug plan. Yet the House measure offers, in subsidies 
and tax breaks, $2.6 billion to the nuclear industry, $5.8 billion to the coal 
industry, $5.8 billion to the private electric utility industry and $19.5 billion 
to the oil and gas industry.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A February 2002 report prepared 
by the minority staff special investigations division of the House Committee on 
Government Reform calculated the campaign contributions made by those industries 
in the 2000 election cycle and compared them to the dollar amount of the benefits 
the industries would receive in the House bill. The rate of return on the industries&#8217; 
investment was 47,700 percent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The House energy measure 
also provides the industries with other special breaks. The government &#8211; 
not the coal industry &#8211; would pay the cost of industry applications to mine 
on federal land. The nuclear industry would get a boost by a provision that would 
promote the idea of building new nuclear plants on Department of Energy land. 
And auto manufacturers would get a huge break by not having to boost fuel efficiency 
of sport utility vehicles. Further, the bill does little to promote energy conservation 
or renewable energy sources.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The House energy bill 
is yet another tax cut for the rich that does little to nothing to secure America&#8217;s 
long-term energy needs,&quot; said Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.). &quot;While 
President Bush and House Republican leaders are giving tens of billions in tax 
cuts to energy companies, they are cutting federal support to elementary and secondary 
schools by $90 million from last year. Their energy bill and their priorities 
are wrong for America.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added Rep. Lynn Woolsey 
(D-Calif.), ranking member on the Science Subcommittee on Energy and a conferee 
for the energy bill, &quot;The answer to America's energy needs is conservation 
and increased use of renewable energy. Our number one priority must be the future 
of America&#8217;s working families. We must develop energy alternatives to stop 
our dependence on dirty, exhaustible fossil fuels, and in that way we will provide 
a healthy, secure future for our children.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also speaking at the event 
were U.S. Reps. Bob Filner (D-Calif.), Maurice Hinchey (D-N.Y.), Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), 
Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Sander Levin (D-Mich.), Edward 
Markey (D-Mass.) and Hilda Solis (D-Calif.). </font></p>
