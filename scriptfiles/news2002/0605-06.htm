<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 5 - Today the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force forcefully responded to efforts underway in Miami-Dade County, FL to pass a ballot initiative eliminating civil rights protections based upon sexual orientation, by announcing the largest effort ever by a national gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) organization to defeat a local ballot initiative. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Twenty-five years ago in Miami, Anita Bryant and other extremist forces led an anti-gay campaign that had a devastating impact on people in South Florida and throughout the nation,&quot; Lorri L. Jean, NGLTF's Executive Director, said in making the announcement. &quot;Their hateful victory deprived the gay and lesbian people of Miami-Dade of essential civil rights protections for more than two decades, and began an avalanche of similar efforts around the country that continue to this day. Now, 25 years later, the exact same discriminatory measure is back on the ballot. We will not let the fanatics prevail again. This will not be &quot;Anita Bryant II.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current ballot fight is identical in almost every respect to former beauty queen and Florida orange juice spokeswoman Anita Bryant's launch of her now infamous and brutal &quot;Save Our Children&quot; campaign 25 years ago. On June 7, 1977, Bryant's campaign resulted in Miami-Dade voters repealing the county's ordinance that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation, by an overwhelming margin of 69% to 31%. &quot;In victory, we shall not be vindictive,&quot; Bryant is quoted as saying in a June 8, 1977, Associated Press article. &quot;We shall continue to seek help and change for homosexuals, whose sick and sad values belie the word 'gay' which they pathetically use to cover their unhappy lives.&quot; Buoyed by the repeal of the Miami-Dade ordinance, right-wing groups intensified efforts to pass anti-gay ballot measures in city after city around the country. Bryant's campaign is widely considered to have been a pivotal moment in the modern GLBT civil rights movement, and GLBT activists across the nation expect the current Miami-Dade ballot fight to be one of the most hotly contested and closely watched this season. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGLTF's support will help SAVE Dade counter the attack of the anti-gay group Take Back Miami-Dade, which has joined forces with Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition to place an amendment on the ballot to once again remove sexual orientation from the county's current anti-discrimination ordinance, passed in 1998. The ordinance prohibits discrimination against gays and lesbians in employment, housing, credit and accommodations. The vote is scheduled for September 10, 2002. Echoing the bigotry and ignorance of 25 years ago, the current anti-gay forces have referred to gay people as &quot;merchants of death&quot; and adopted the battle cry, &quot;no special rights for sodomites.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is clearly going to be an uphill battle for us,&quot; Jean continued. &quot;The outcome of the Miami-Dade vote isn't simply a local issue. In many ways this vote is a referendum on the progress that the GLBT community has made in this country. NGLTF intends to put the full strength of its resources behind the effort to preserve Miami-Dade's protections for the gay community. If we don't, the consequences for our community nationally could be disastrous.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of its campaign, NGLTF will support the efforts of SAVE Dade, the local organization spearheading the effort to defeat the ballot initiative, with an unprecedented level of resources.</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGLTF will make a cash grant of $50,000 to Save Dade--making NGLTF by far the largest contributor to SAVE Dade's campaign, and to date the largest contribution ever made by a national GLBT organization to a local ballot campaign.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NGLTF has dedicated six full-time staff to work with SAVE Dade to organize at the local level to defeat the initiative.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the weeks leading up to the election, NGLTF will recruit, train, and deploy 80 volunteers from around the country in Miami-Dade, to identify and mobilize more than 20,000 Miami-Dade voters who support retaining the current ordinance. In addition, NGLTF has mobilized the National Religious Leadership Roundtable (NRLR), an interfaith network of leaders from pro-GLBT faith, spiritual, and religious organizations, to organize more than 500 volunteers to identify and mobilize additional voters, and to support the efforts of Save Dade. </font></li>

</ul>
