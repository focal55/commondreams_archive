- July 26 - Vivendi Universal&#8217;s financial woes, which have been well-publicized 

in recent weeks, are troubling to those who monitor the growing trend toward the 

privatization of public water systems. That is because one company linked closely 

to Vivendi Universal &#8211; USFilter &#8211; is the largest water service company 

operating in the United States and is bidding to operate the water and sewage 

works in communities across the country, including Stockton, Calif., and New Orleans.

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While USFilter appears to be financially sound, Vivendi Universal clearly is 

not, and we are concerned that Vivendi Universal could siphon money from the more 

profitable company. Communities whose water systems are USFilter-operated could 

face deterioration of service quality and grapple with aging infrastructure not 

receiving needed repairs. (Vivendi Universal owns 40 percent of Vivendi Environnement. 

USFilter is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vivendi Environnement.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time Vivendi Universal has used a subsidiary 

to obtain much-needed cash. In June, news reports said that USFilter was selling 

its distribution business to generate cash for Vivendi Universal. The beleaguered 

French parent company is a media and entertainment giant that has amassed a $33 

billion debt during an ambitious acquisition drive. The debt was recently downgraded 

to &quot;junk bond&quot; status on fears that the company lacks enough cash to 

make payments on it. More than a third of the debt belongs to Vivendi Environnement. 

In June, Vivendi Universal reduced its stake in the environment subsidiary from 

65 to 40 percent to get the subsidiary&#8217;s debt off its books.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given its parent company&#8217;s problems, the future ability of USFilter to 

meet its current contract obligations is uncertain. It would be foolhardy to transfer 

the responsibility of providing water and wastewater services to a company with 

an enormous debt and a questionable future.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our local governments should continue to own and operate their water and sewer 

systems. If improvements are necessary, the answer is not to hand over public 

resources to private interests but instead to make a commitment to increase efficiency 

and introduce savings within the framework of municipal operation. Communities 

should be aware that the companies taking over water systems promise cost savings 

and better service but rarely explain the risks of privatization, such as hidden 

costs, inadequate maintenance and service lapses. Only public utilities, when 

run well, can ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable drinking 

water.</font></p>
