- July 29 - The Administration&#8217;s &#8220;Clear Skies&#8221; legislation, 

introduced today in Congress, will dismantle the Clean Air Act and severely weaken 

the nation&#8217;s effort to fight air pollution. The plan will not reduce power 

plant emissions enough to clear the skies and protect the nation&#8217;s health. 

In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s own analysis shows that the 

Clean Air Act will provide greater pollution reductions than those proposed by 

the Administration initiative. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, most current EPA activity 

is focused on inaction and attempts to avoid implementation of existing clean 

air regulations. The Administration&#8217;s proposals would delay reaching clean 

air goals even further. Indeed, air pollution clean up plans to meet the public 

health standards for smog and fine particles issued in 1997 are still years away. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, millions of Americans 

continue to breathe dirty air. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The public demands and deserves cleaner 

air. This legislation fails to move us forward and Congress should reject it.

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The American Lung Association&reg; 

has been fighting lung disease for nearly 100 years. With the generous support 

of the public and the help of volunteers, we have seen many advances against lung 

disease. However, our work is not finished. As we look forward to our second century, 

we will continue to strive to make breathing easier for everyone through programs 

of education, community service, advocacy, and research. The American Lung Association&reg;'s 

activities are supported by donations to Christmas Seals&reg; and other voluntary 

contributions. You may obtain additional information via the American Lung Association
