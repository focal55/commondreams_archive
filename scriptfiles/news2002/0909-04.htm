Web Site Is Misguided; Dismiss Falwell&#8217;s Lawsuit Against Internet Critic,

- September 9 - A lawsuit Jerry Falwell filed in Virginia against an Internet 

critic should be dismissed because it was filed in the wrong state and has no 

merit, Public Citizen told a court today. It is Falwell&#8217;s second legal attempt 

to shut down the critic&#8217;s Web site, which parodies Falwell and his statements 

about the responsibility of gays for the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, among 

other things.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The site, at <a href="http://www.jerryfalwell.com" target="_new">www.jerryfalwell.com</a> 

and <a href="http://www.jerryfallwell.com" target="_new">www.jerryfallwell.com</a>, 

pokes fun at Falwell&#8217;s advocacy of Biblical literalism and his penchant 

for giving advice. Another page purports to discover a biblical code showing that 

Falwell is a false prophet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the site went up last year, Falwell&#8217;s attorney sent the site&#8217;s 

creator, Illinois resident Gary Cohn, a letter demanding that Cohn turn over the 

domain names to Falwell. Cohn refused. Falwell then filed a complaint against 

Cohn with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), alleging trademark 

violations, even though Falwell had never registered his name as a trademark.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The WIPO rejected Falwell&#8217;s claims, so on June 20, Falwell sued Cohn 

in the U.S. District Court&#8217;s Western District of Virginia. He alleged trademark 

violations and libel.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a motion filed with the court today, Public Citizen, which along with the 

ACLU of Virginia is representing Cohn, asked the court to dismiss the case for 

a variety of reasons.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary reason is that the court lacks jurisdiction, and hearing the case 

in Virginia would have serious First Amendment implications for Internet users 

everywhere.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cohn lives in Illinois, is not licensed to do business in Virginia, doesn&#8217;t 

have an office or employees there, and owns no property in Virginia. Cohn&#8217;s 

message in no way targets Virginia residents. Registration of domain names with 

a Virginia company also is insufficient to establish jurisdiction, and anyway, 

the names have since been moved, Public Citizen argued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The only reason Falwell filed suit in Virginia is because he lives there,&quot; 

said Paul Alan Levy, the attorney with Public Citizen who is representing Cohn. 

&quot;Yet Falwell is hauling Cohn to a court hundreds of miles from Cohn&#8217;s 

home. If the court were to hear this case, it would set a dangerous precedent. 

People who type their thoughts about public figures on a computer would think 

twice if they knew they would have to defend themselves at any spot on the globe 

where the figure happened to be. That would seriously hamper people&#8217;s First 

Amendment rights.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Falwell were to file suit anywhere, it should be Illinois, Levy said. Still, 

the suit would fail on other grounds.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cohn is not violating trademark law because his Web site sells nothing, advertises 

no products or services, and makes no money, Levy told the court. Also, Falwell 

has not registered his name as a trademark.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Falwell&#8217;s libel claim stemming from the statement that Falwell 

is a false prophet has no merit because it is an opinion, not a statement of fact, 

and therefore can&#8217;t give rise to a libel suit. Also, it would be impossible 

to prove whether Falwell is a false prophet, Levy argued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen is representing 

Cohn because it has a history of championing First Amendment rights on the Internet.
