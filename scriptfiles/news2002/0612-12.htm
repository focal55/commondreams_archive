YORK - June 12 - AIDS activists leading efforts to secure treatment for people 
dying with AIDS are targeting the world's largest companies today at the Gala 
Awards ceremony of the Global Business Council on HIV/AIDS. The ceremony, attended 
by Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, is to be held at Pier 60 
of the Chelsea Piers June 12, 2002.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Multinational companies have no laurels to rest on,&quot; said ACT UP 
New York co-founder and HIV-positive activist Eric Sawyer. &quot;The most prominent 
members of the Global Business Council -- Coca-Cola and Anglo American -- have 
plainly reneged on their promises to provide antiretroviral treatment and care 
to their workers and their families. They have nothing to be proud of, and nothing 
to be congratulated for.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to activists, representatives to the awards ceremony from corporations 
with large African employee bases should stop celebrating and take substantive 
steps to provide treatment to people with HIV and AIDS in the developing world. 
&quot;The massive corporations that are members of the Global Business Council 
have not done enough to sit in a room and congratulate each other on their good 
work. They have skirted their most fundamental obligation, which is to pay for 
treatment for their workers,&quot; said Sharonann Lynch of ACT UP New York.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Richard Holbrooke, the United Nations and multinational corporations 
have promised to bring life and hope to millions of people with HIV in the developing 
world by providing antiretroviral treatment. Instead, we've lost ground over the 
past year, as Coca-Cola and Anglo-American have broken their promises,&quot; added 
Lynch.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At Coca-Cola's annual meeting activists launched a campaign singling out the 
beverage company, the largest sole private sector employer in Africa, for their 
refusal to pay for HIV treatment for workers in their bottling and distribution 
facilities. Coca-Cola has refused, choosing instead to offer little more than 
billboard and truck space to desperately poor African country governments for 
anti-AIDS advertisements and safe sex materials.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Crumbs from Coke while thousands of workers face a needless death sentence 
are unacceptable. Coke must commit to paying for the full course of antiretroviral 
treatment for all of their infected workers and their families,&quot; said Amanda 
Lugg of ACT UP New York. &quot;With over 100,000 employees, Coke is the largest 
private employer in Africa. Africa is Coke&sup1;s largest growth market. The company's 
inaction is inexcusable.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Last year, Coca-Cola and Anglo-American grabbed the headlines with big 
announcements about workplace initiatives. Anglo-American has reneged on its treatment 
policy; Coca-Cola has failed to treat its workers and their families,&quot; said 
Eustacia Smith of ACT UP New York. &quot;Meanwhile there are 14,000 new HIV infections 
every day.&quot;</font></p>
