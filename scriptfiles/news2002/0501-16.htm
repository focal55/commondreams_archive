Regulation For Sea-Going Vessel Air Pollution</div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 1 - The Environmental 

Protection Agency today proposed air emission standards for large 

sea-going vessels such as oil tankers, cruise ships, and cargo 

vessels that will do little to clean the air, according to 

environmental groups. Each day in large ports such as Long Beach, 

Calif., these ships can generate as much pollution as one million 

cars. These vessels represent the fastest growing, least-regulated 

sources of pollution in the United States. The EPA has identified 

foreign vessels as major contributors to U.S. air pollution, but 

has refused to regulate these ships. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proposed new rules resulted from a lawsuit settlement 

reached in 2001 by the San Francisco-based environmental group, 

Bluewater Network, represented by Earthjustice, challenging EPA's 

failure to set any standard for smog-forming emissions under the 

Clean Air Act. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Oil tanker owners and the oil industry have relentlessly 

lobbied the administration to weaken or delay this regulation, and 

clearly they succeeded,&quot; said Dr. Russell Long, director of 

Bluewater Network. &quot;This is terrible news for Americans living 

around coastal cities because ships are the world's biggest 

polluters, poisoning the air with smog, fine particles, and global 

warming gases. This is a sham regulation that will force public 

health and environmental groups back to court.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oil tanker owners are represented by an Association called 

Intertanko, which has heavily lobbied the Administration to delay 

or weaken the proposed EPA regulations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Globally, the world's biggest ships account for 14 percent of 

total nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 16 percent of all sulfur oxide 

emissions from petroleum sources. According to the EPA, large ships 

belch 273 thousand tons per year -- 748 tons each day -- of NOx 

into U.S. air. Given recent technology advances, a 90 to 95 percent 

decrease in NOx emissions appears well within reach; sulfur levels 

should be established to meet similar levels already achieved by 

Sweden. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These ships run on the dirtiest fuel available,&quot; said Martin 

Wagner, attorney for Earthjustice. &quot;While port communities from Los 

Angeles to Boston try to meet federal clean air standards, their 

efforts can be thwarted by just a few cargo ships a day belching 

the equivalent of the pollution from thousands of unregulated 

vehicle and stationary source emission.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since worldwide shipping is expected to triple by 2020 as a 

result of global trade agreements, air pollution is expected to 

jump significantly. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to establish 

regulations to reduce air pollution from non-automobile engines 

that significantly contribute to pollution in areas with poor air 

quality. Based on a 1991 study, EPA determined that the largest 

type of ship engines -- called &quot;Category 3&quot; engines -- were a 

&quot;significant contributor&quot; of important pollutants, including NOx. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA claimed it did not need to regulate these engines because an 

international marine pollution treaty -- called the MARPOL Annex VI 

Convention -- may slightly reduce NOx emissions. However, the 1997 

treaty is unlikely to take effect for many years, because it 

requires ratification by countries responsible for at least 50 

percent of world shipping tonnage, representing at least 15 

nations. So far only five nations, representing only 16 percent of 

the world shipping fleet, have ratified the agreement. Although the 

United States has signed the agreement, the administration has not 

sent the agreement to the U.S. Senate for ratification. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bluewater Network issued a report called &quot;A Stacked Deck: Air 

Pollution from Large Ships,&quot; 

(<a href="http://www.earthisland.org/bw/stacked.pdf" target="_new">http://www.earthisland.org/bw/stacked.pdf</a>) that indicates that 

large ships are the world's dirtiest transportation source, 

exposing ship and dock workers, as well as port residents, to 

significant air pollution. </font></p>
