<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DETROIT, 
MI - June 12 - The Sierra Club today announced the launch of a three-year
campaign to urge the &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers to improve the fuel economy 
of
their vehicles.</FONT>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The American people want the choice to drive cars, trucks, and SUVs that
go farther on a gallon of gas,&quot; said Carl Pope, executive director of the
Sierra Club. &quot;It's time Detroit gave them what they want. The technology
exists today to allow the automakers to continue offering their most
popular models, but with significantly improved fuel economy. New, safe,
fuel-saving SUVs and pickups could be on sale very soon.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club released just-completed public opinion research showing
that consumers want automakers to offer cars and trucks with better fuel
economy. Their reasons: to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil, save
money at the gas pump and cut pollution.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club is targeting the Big Three automakers after Congress
succumbed to a misleading campaign by the auto industry and voted not to
raise fuel economy standards. &quot;This campaign was created to correct the
false impressions left by the automakers and to tell consumers that they
can and should have the option of buying a safe, fuel-efficient car, SUV,
or pickup truck,&quot; explained Pope.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club's campaign will urge consumers to ask auto dealers for a
&quot;Freedom Option Package,&quot; a set of fuel-saving components which could 
be
added to most standard models, and which, taken together, could put the
fleets of the Big Three on the road to 40 miles per gallon.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Detroit wants to sell option packages featuring seat warmers and cup
holders. What America needs is an option package that frees us from
dependence on foreign oil, saves money at the pump, and cuts pollution,&quot;
said Dan Becker, Director of Sierra Club's Clean Energy Program.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition, the campaign will mobilize the Club's 700,000 members across
the country to hold events at local auto dealers, highlighting public
demand for these fuel-saving technologies.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I care about the auto industry, I care about my customers, and I care
about the environment,&quot; said Chuck Frank, a prominent Chicago, IL Chevrolet
dealer and long-time advocate of increased fuel economy. &quot;My customers want
to be able to keep buying their favorite models of cars and SUVs, but they
want them to get more miles to the gallon. I'd like to give my customers
what they want.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Television and radio ads, featuring former Senator and decorated Navy Seal
Bob Kerrey, and retired Vice Admiral Jack Shanahan, Military Advisory
Committee Chairman of truemajority.com, appeal to automakers to do their
part to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by manufacturing more
fuel-efficient vehicles. Both men have distinguished records of military
service, and, in the ads, they urge the auto industry to do its part to
loosen the grip of oil-producing countries and help save American lives.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have every hope and confidence that the automakers can deliver what 
the
American people want and need: cars, trucks, and SUVs that go farther on a
gallon of gas, without sacrificing safety, comfort, and affordability,&quot;
continued Pope. &quot;We urge them to help lead the auto industry, and the
country, into a new age.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Senator Bob Kerrey, Nebraska and former U.S. Navy Seal:
&quot;We ask our young men and women to sacrifice their safety and perhaps their
lives to fight the war against terrorism. Surely we can do something here
at home to help. We all know that our dependency on imported oil is part
of the problem and we know that increasing the fuel economy of the cars we
drive is part of the solution.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's time for us to tell the auto industry that we want to break the 
grip
of oil-producing countries and reduce our oil use. It's time to tell them
to stop spending millions of dollars to kill federal legislation that would
require them to make vehicles that get better gas mileage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The truth is we don't have to give up our pick-up trucks or SUVs. All 
we
have to do is use existing technology and American know-how to make SUVs
and pick-up trucks that go farther on a gallon of gas. Tell the automakers
that on the morning of September 11, politics as usual became unacceptable.
Tell them you're prepared to do your part by buying cars that save gas and
the lives of America's Armed Forces.&quot;</font></p>

&quot;When I commanded the U.S. Second Fleet, I worried about threats that would

nations if we use technology to reduce our need for oil, by making vehicles
that go farther on a gallon of gas.</font></p>
