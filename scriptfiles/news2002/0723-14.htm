PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - July 23 - A Florida federal jury today awarded $54.6 million 

to three Salvadorans who proved they were tortured by Salvadoran security forces. 

Juan Romagoza, Neriz Gonzalez and Carlos Mauricio sued two Salvadoran generals 

who retired to Florida in 1989. The suit is based on two federal laws that allow 

torture victims to seek redress in U.S. courts, even if the offenses occurred 

elsewhere.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two retired generals are Jos&eacute; Guillermo Garcia, Salvadoran Minister 

of Defense and Public Security from 1979-1983, and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, 

the Director-General of the Salvadoran National Guard from 1979-1983, and subsequently 

Minister of Defense and Public Security. Both men are connected to the School 

of the Americas (SOA). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">General Jos&eacute; Guillermo Garc&iacute;a received counterinsurgency training 

at the SOA in 1962. As defense minister Garc&iacute;a refused to investigate reports 

that approximately 900 hundred unarmed civilians were brutally murdered by the 

U.S.-trained Atlacatl battalion in 1981. A 1993 UN Truth Commission on El Salvador 

verified the reports. Garc&iacute;a also failed to launch a serious investigation 

of the murder of four U.S. church women by members of the Salvadoran National 

Guard in December 1980. Garc&iacute;a was granted residency in the U.S. in 1989.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">General Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova was a Guest Speaker at the SOA in 1985. 

A UN Truth Commission Report cited him for ordering the assassination of four 

U.S. church women in 1980. Vides Casanova was granted residency in the U.S. in 

1989.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During a four-week trial that began on June 24 the plaintiffs told of being 

detained and brutally tortured by Salvadoran national guardsmen and police under 

the command of the two generals. The jury began deliberations on Thursday afternoon, 

and deliberated for 20 hours. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SOA (renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) is 

a combat training school for Latin American soldiers. Its graduates are consistently 

involved in human rights atrocities. In 1996 the Pentagon was forced to release 

training manuals used at the school that advocated the use of torture, extortion 

and execution. In December 2000 Congress authorized the WHISC to replace the SOA. 

The renaming of the school was widely viewed as an attempt to diffuse public criticism 

and to disassociate the school from its reputation. SOA Watch maintains that the 

underlying purpose of the school, to control the economic and political systems 

of Latin America by aiding and influencing Latin American militaries, remains 

the same.</font></p>
