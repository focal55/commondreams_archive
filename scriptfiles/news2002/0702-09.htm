- July 2 - &quot;George W. Bush spent the early part of this week on a 'family 
values tour,' touting his backward-looking proposals to marry-off poor women and 
pour federal money into religious programs,&quot; said National Organization for 
Women (NOW) President Kim Gandy. &quot;All this lip service to 'family values' 
is little more than a transparent attempt to mold domestic policy to suit the 
likes of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. These impoverished proposals skew public 
policy to the detriment of poor women, poor families and poor children across 
the country.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bush told supporters in Cleveland that 'we've got to teach people the 
values of marriage and family,'&quot; Gandy said. &quot;The people of this country 
expect more from their government than a married-or-invisible vision of women's 
place in society.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The purpose of welfare is to help the poorest people move out of poverty 
and into self-sufficiency. To make 'finding a man' the Administration-approved 
ticket out of poverty is not just an insulting throwback, it's terrible public 
policy,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;The $1 billion marriage promotion scheme touted 
by the Administration, passed by the House and currently pending in the Senate's 
welfare reform bill is thinly disguised social engineering.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Administration's my-way-or-the-highway approach to helping poor moms 
and kids won't help those who need help the most. It doesn't take a rocket scientist 
to see that the way to end the vicious cycle of poverty and punishment is to make 
sure that education, child care, health care, transportation and decent housing 
are available to all struggling families,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;Instead, Bush's 
welfare proposals siphon off funds to pay for the Dick Cheney Dating Game while 
perversely mandating stiffer work requirements without the supports necessary 
to hold down a good job.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's time to get serious about welfare,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;Poor 
women and their children need and deserve fair legislation that will yield results. 
Until we guarantee education and essential work supports not a single dime should 
be diverted from those critical needs.&quot;</font></p>
