- May 13 - The 11th Annual National 

Police Week will begin Monday, May 13 at 8 p.m. with a candlelight 

vigil at The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in 

Washington, D.C. The week-long tribute to America's federal, state 

and local police officers, honors those who died in the line of 

duty and those who continue to protect and serve everyday at great 

personal risk. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence united 

with The Million Mom March (MMM) is proud to announce its support 

for this event and we encourage a nation to come together in honor 

of our fallen officers. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No one knows the danger of gun violence better than America's 

law enforcement,&quot; said James Brady, former Press Secretary to 

President Ronald Reagan, gun violence victim and survivor. &quot;I urge 

all Americans to stop and share a moment of silence in remembrance 

of these fallen hero's who have unselfishly given the ultimate 

sacrifice in their quest for public safety.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Each year our nation recognizes those men and women who have 

given the ultimate sacrifice of their lives so that each of us can 

live safe in our communities,&quot; said John Shanks, Law Enforcement 

Relations spokesman for The Brady Campaign and MMM. &quot;Please join all of us at the Brady Campaign and MMM in honoring those 

individuals during National Police Week.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund 

(NLEOMF), more than 100 police officers die in the line of duty 

every year and gun violence is the leading cause of those deaths. 

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence united with The Million 

Mom March is committed to drastically reducing, and even erasing, 

this yearly statistic by creating a safer America through 

common-sense gun laws. </font></p>
