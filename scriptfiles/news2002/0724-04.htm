- July 24 - At EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., members of Greenpeace and 

Clean Water Action passed out "ballots" today to EPA employees urging them to 

"stand up to the White House and pollution lobby" by casting their votes for chemical 

plant safety legislation. Greenpeace spokesperson, Rick Hind said, "the last ten 

months of inaction by the EPA are intolerable." </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

<p><font size="2"> A large banner of the ballot displayed "EPA's Choice on Homeland Security" 

offering two options: "New Chemical Plant Safety Law" or "More Inaction & Polluter 

Secrecy." Another banner named President Bush the "Toxic Texan." </font></font></font>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a letter today to EPA Administrator, 

Christine Todd Whitman, Greenpeace urged the Administration to "put special interest 

politics aside and pursue legislation." A vote is scheduled tomorrow in the Senate 

Environment and Public Works Committee. Charging the EPA with ten months of "inaction" 

and policy reversals, the group concluded the letter saying that "rapidly approaching 

anniversary of September 11th is a grim reminder that history will not judge missed 

opportunities and further inaction kindly." 

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hind added, "leaked EPA documents show dramatic policy reversals by the EPA 

that strongly suggest that the Agency has been overruled by the White House to 

satisfy the pollution lobby." One of these documents shows that the EPA was actually 

drafting legislation until Congress first scheduled action on the bill in June. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A bi-partisan Senate vote in the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee 

would be a major step toward the enactment of a new law that would help eliminate 

similar terrorist threats at chemical plants across the U.S. "The pollution lobby 

and their friends at the White House should not be allowed to kill this urgently 

needed legislation," said Hind. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> EPA records show that 123 chemical facilities could threaten a million or 

more nearby residents if attacked. The U.S. Army's surgeon general estimates that 

2.4 million people could be killed or injured in a terrorist attack at one U.S. 

toxic chemical plant. And recently a Pittsburgh reporter anonymously walked into 

more than 60 US chemical plants without challenge.</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">###</font></p>
