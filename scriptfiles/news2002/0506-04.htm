- May 6 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a wave of grassroots mobilization not seen in a generation, 

thousands of anti-poverty activists will participate in a 

nationwide series of coordinated events around welfare reform 

reauthorization. Over the next month, candlelight vigils, rallies, 

speeches, lobbying days and conferences will call attention to the 

opportunity Congress has in welfare reform reauthorization to 

reduce poverty in America. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're sending the message that the extreme welfare proposals 

put forth by President Bush and passed by the House will not pass 

quietly in the United States Senate,&quot; said Deepak Bhargava, 

director of the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support and 

chief organizer of the Make TANF Work! campaign. &quot;Tens of thousands 

of activists will create a massive swell of grassroots activity 

that Senators will find impossible to ignore. These activists are 

the people impacted by TANF reauthorization and they refuse to sit 

idly by while so-called moderate Democrats push unfair, unworkable 

welfare plans on the Hill.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Mothers Day, May 12, grassroots organizations led by 

low-income people will hand-deliver Mothers' Day cards to their 

Senators' homes to demand action on behalf of millions of poor 

mothers in America. On May 20, National Interfaith Day of Action, 

religious leaders from many different faiths will lead simultaneous 

candlelight vigils of more than 100 people each in 20 major cities 

to demand their Senators heed the moral imperative to end poverty 

in America. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support (NCJIS), a 

project of the Center for Community Change, is a coalition of more 

than 1000 grassroots anti-poverty groups that has been organizing 

since 2000 to transform TANF into a meaningful anti-poverty 

program. Under the banner Make TANF Work!, the National Campaign is 

spearheading a national effort to fashion a progressive policy and 

political strategy on welfare reform. </font></p>
