- September 5 - The National Organization for Women applauds the Senate Judiciary 

Committee's rejection of Priscilla Owen, a right-wing ideologue nominated to the 

Court of Appeals by the Bush administration. We share Senator Dianne Feinstein's 

regret in opposing the elevation of a woman to a position of power that is too 

often denied to women because of the glass ceiling; but in this case, one woman's 

advancement would have threatened the advancement of all women's rights. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If confirmed, Owen would have served 

for a lifetime on a court that is already dominated by conservatives hostile to 

women's rights and civil rights. Her judicial record has made it abundantly clear 

that, if elevated to the U.S. Court of Appeals, she would have worked to curtail 

the reproductive rights of all women, especially young women, and limit the rights 

of consumers and employees. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We've seen Judge Owen use the 

courtroom to further her narrow beliefs and ideals, going so far as to virtually 

re-write laws rather than fairly interpret them,&quot; stated NOW President Kim 

Gandy. &quot;The last thing the Fifth Circuit needs is another judge who can't 

leave her political ideology at the courthouse door.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;NOW thanks those Senators who 

voted to reject this nomination and asks President Bush to reconsider his decision 

to persist in bringing extreme right-wing ideologues to the Senate for confirmation,&quot; 

said Gandy. </font></p>
