Author of the recent book &quot;Secret Trials and Executions: Military Tribunals 
and the Threat to Democracy,&quot; Olshansky said today: &quot;Since the attacks 
of September 11, the United States has witnessed a sweeping revision of its immigration 
laws, foreign intelligence gathering operations, and domestic law enforcement 
procedures. These changes, like those adopted during some of the most notorious 
episodes in our nation's history, involve a profound curtailment of our civil 
liberties. In the not-too-distant past, the U.S. government reacted to national 
security threats with policies that we now remember with horror. The Red Scare 
and the Palmer raids after the First World War, the internment of Japanese Americans 
during the Second World War, the repressive and chilling measures of the McCarthy 
era, and the harassment and prosecution of political dissidents during and after 
the Vietnam War all represent policies that history will forever recall with regret 
and shame. Given this unfortunate past, we need to closely examine the current 
administration's responses to September 11 and assess what those responses mean 
in terms of international law, the U.S. Constitution, and our commitment to democracy. 
We must take a thorough look at what the Bush administration is doing in the name 
of defending national security and ask ourselves: Is such a compromise of civil 
liberties, democracy, and human rights ever tolerable?&quot;</font> </p>

Executive director of the Muslim American Society's Freedom Foundation, Bray said 
today: &quot;We cannot truly wage a war against terrorism by undermining the basic 
principles of the Constitution and the rule of law, such as free speech, due process, 
the right to a speedy trial, the right to face your accuser, and the presumption 
of innocence until proven guilty. Also at issue is the racial profiling and the 
targeting of the Muslim and Arab communities.&quot;</font></p>

Professor of international law at Ohio State University, Quigley said today: &quot;The 
commission finds the prisoner not guilty on all charges. 'Guards! Put the prisoner 
back in his cell, and throw away the key!' This is not Alice in Wonderland. It 
is 'justice' Guantanamo-style, to be dispensed by the military commissions that 
President George Bush is establishing. As explained by Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld, anyone acquitted may still be held indefinitely. Not to worry, however. 
The chances of an acquittal are worse than for a snowstorm at Guantanamo.... Military 
commissions are ad hoc, created on the basis of the President's power under the 
Constitution as commander in chief of the armed forces. That is why it is the 
Pentagon, rather than Congress, that has been scrambling since November to write 
rules to govern their proceedings. Legally, military commissions occupy a nether 
existence....&quot;</font></p>
