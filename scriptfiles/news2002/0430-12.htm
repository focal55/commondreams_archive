- April 30 -  At 3:00 pm today, Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed Intro. 24, an amendment to New York City's Human Rights Law, which takes immediate effect with his signature. The measure adds explicit coverage for transgender people under the city law to prohibit discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.

</font>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Today Mayor Bloomberg exemplified tremendous leadership in supporting and signing this law into effect," said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF). "By including all people in his vision for an inclusive society, Mayor Bloomberg has shown that civil rights for transgender people are an integral part of the future for this country. New York City is now more able to live up to its reputation as place where freedom and liberty are dear and individuals are judged on merit rather than personal characteristics."

</font>

<P>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Both the fact that the bill passed by such an overwhelming margin and that the mayor pushed for its passage shows that transgender-inclusive thinking is the wave of the future. It also attests to the tremendous effect that local activists can have when they organize and take concerted action," Jean continued.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Intro. 24 passed overwhelmingly in the city council on April 24, by a vote of 45 to 5 (with one abstention). New York activists from the New York Association for Gender Rights Advocacy, the New York TransGender Coalition, and the Empire State Pride Agenda, among others, worked tirelessly for passage of this bill.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The passage of this measure in New York City, with a population of just over eight million people, dramatically increases at the national level the number and percentage of persons covered by explicitly transgender-inclusive anti-discrimination laws, from 5.4 percent to 8.3 percent of

the population, to a total of 23 million (representing overall a 53% increase in the number of people protected). In the past several weeks, three other jurisdictions have passed anti-discrimination laws that include transgender people: Allentown, PA; Erie County, PA; and Tacoma, WA. Two states, Minnesota and Rhode Island, have explicit coverage in their statewide anti-discrimination laws. With the addition

of New York City, there are now a total of 42 jurisdictions in the US that explicitly include transgender people in their anti-discrimination laws, including 33 cities, seven counties, and two states.
