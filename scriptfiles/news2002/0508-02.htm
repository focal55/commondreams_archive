- May 8 - US Navy and Air Force 

biotechnology laboratories are proposing development of offensive 

biological weapons. The weapons, genetically engineered microbes that 

attack items such as fuel, plastics and asphalt, would violate 

federal and international law. The proposals have been made by the 

Naval Research Laboratory (Washington, DC) and the Armstrong 

Laboratory (Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas). They date 

from 1997; but were recently submitted by the Marine Corps for a 

high-level assessment by a panel of the US National Academies of 

Science (NAS). The NAS panel (see website for members) has prepared a 

draft report; but it has not been released to the public.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The uncovering of these proposals for an offensive biological weapons 

program comes at a critical political juncture. The US has rejected a 

legally-binding system of United Nations inspections of suspected 

biological weapons facilities.  At the same time, the Bush 

administration is aggressively accusing other countries of developing 

biological weapons and expanding its so-called &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; based 

in large part on allegations of foreign biological weapons 

development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But it is increasingly apparent that there are serious questions 

about the United States' own compliance with the Biological and Toxin 

Weapons Convention (BTWC). While US allegations against other 

countries are generally undocumented, the proposals described in this 

press release were recently released to the Sunshine Project under 

the Freedom of Information Act and have been placed on the internet 

for independent analysis (See www.sunshine-project.org).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Explicitly for Offense:  In the murky world of biological weapons 

research, many technologies are &quot;dual use&quot;, that is, they have both 

offensive and peaceful applications.  The alleged transfer of dual 

use technologies, such as vaccine research, is a basis of charges 

made against Cuba on May 6th by US Under Secretary of State John 

Bolton. The US armed forces documents released here, however, are not 

about &quot;dual use&quot; technology, they are explicit proposals for 

offensive weaponsmaking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Naval Research Laboratory, &quot;It is the purpose of the 

proposed research to capitalize on the degradative potential of&#138; 

naturally occurring microorganisms, and to engineer additional, 

focused degradative capabilities into [genetically modified 

microorganisms], to produce systems that will degrade the warfighting 

capabilities of potential adversaries.&quot;  The Air Force proposes 

&quot;genetically engineered catalysts made by bacteria that destroy&#138; 

Catalysts can be engineered to destroy whatever war material is 

desired.&quot;  The proposals indicate these weapons might be used by all 

the armed forces, including the Special Forces and in peacekeeping 

and anti-narcotics operations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additional Documents Suppressed:  These proposals are probably only 

the tip of the iceberg. For over one year, the Marine Corps has 

delayed response to a Sunshine Project Freedom of Information Act 

request that now includes 147 unclassified documents. The two 

proposals described here are part of a recent first release of 8 

items from that request. 139 related legal and weapons development 

documents are unreleased. The Marine Corps says the delay is due to a 

lack of manpower.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Academies are also suppressing related documents. As 

part of the Marine Corps-commissioned study, in 2001 at least 77 

apparently chemical and biological weapons-related documents were 

deposited in the NAS Public Access Records File, a library open for 

inspection and copying by all persons. After the Sunshine Project 

requested copies of these documents on March 12th 2002, the National 

Academies placed a &quot;security hold&quot; on the public file. High-ranking 

NAS officials have refused to explain who ordered the hold, or to 

offer a credible explanation as to why it exists. The Sunshine 

Project believes that NAS is under pressure from high-ranking US 

officials to &quot;Enron&quot; the public record to avoid release of 

politically sensitive material. Rather than assist a purge of the 

public record,  NAS - a leading US non-profit scientific body - must 

condemn and release the proposals for illegal weapons that is has 

received.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Legal Implications:  The research proposed by the Air Force and Navy 

raises serious legal questions.  Under the US Biological Weapons 

Anti-Terrorism Act, development of biological weapons, including 

those that attack materials, is subject to federal criminal and civil 

penalties.  The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which the US 

and 143 other countries have ratified, prohibits development, 

acquisition, and stockpiling of any biological agents not justifiable 

for peaceful or prophylactic purposes. There is no such justification 

for the offensive research proposed by the Navy and Air Force.  The 

proposals are certain to weigh heavily on all countries' minds as 

they prepare for November's reconstituted 5th Review Conference of 

the BTWC.
