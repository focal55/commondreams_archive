- May 13 - Women from across the world said today that an international tribunal was 

the only way to hold accountable those most responsible for crimes against 

humanity committed in East Timor.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 125 women from 14 countries and 22 U.S. states signed the 

statement, which was released by the East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) 

less than a week before East Timor becomes the first new nation of the 

millennium.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The Indonesian [ad hoc Human Rights] court will not adequately address 

cases of gender violence and the systematic targeting of women and 

children, among other serious crimes,&#148; asserts the statement, which is 

signed by such well-known women as activist Gloria Steinem; actor Susan 

Sarandon and playwright Eve Ensler; Judith Shapiro, President of Barnard 

College; authors Naomi Klein and Susan Brownmiller; Jessica Neuwirth, 

President of Equality Now; Eleanor Smeal of Feminist Majority; author and 

organizer Vandana Shiva of India; and human rights defender Sister Dianna 

Ortiz. Three members of Congress, Representatives Tammy Baldwin (WI), 

Barbara Lee (CA) and Cynthia McKinney (GA), also signed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This strong showing of international women&#146;s solidarity recognizes the 

suffering of East Timorese women during the Indonesian military occupation, 

while paying tribute to the long tradition of women working for justice and 

peace,&#148; said ETAN field organizer Diane Farsetta. &#147;The wide range of 

signatories, including members of Congress, authors, actors and 

activists  demonstrates the strong consensus on this important issue.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statement was initiated by women&#146;s groups in East Timor and begins by 

quoting REDE, the East Timorese Women&#146;s Network: &#147;Of all the victims of 

Indonesian military violence the greatest suffering was borne by women, who 

up to this time, have not met with the justice they hoped for.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1975, the Indonesian military illegally invaded and occupied East Timor; 

more than one-third of East Timor&#146;s population was killed. Women were 

specifically targeted by the Indonesian military with rape, kidnapping and 

torture, as well as forced &#147;marriage&#148; and sterilization. In 1999, over 98 

percent of eligible East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence in 

a UN-organized referendum. After the results were announced, the Indonesian 

military and its militias carried out a brutal scorched-earth campaign in 

retaliation, killing at least 2,000 people, raping hundreds of women and 

girls, displacing some 600,000 people, and destroying more than 75 percent 

of the country&#146;s infrastructure. An international peacekeeping force 

finally restored stability a month later, and the UN has administered the 

territory since then. On May 20, East Timor becomes fully independent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Investigations by the UN and the Indonesian government&#146;s own human rights 

commission found the Indonesian military responsible for 1999&#146;s atrocities. 

UN commissions and High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson have 

called for an international human rights tribunal to be established for 

East Timor. Seeking to avoid international action, the Indonesian 

government promised to hold its own trials. Its ad hoc Human Rights Court 

on East Timor began hearing cases last March. However, Indonesian and 

international human rights groups have sharply criticized the court. The 

International Crisis Group recently reported that the process is so 

problematic it may &#147;trivialize&#133; the concept of crimes against humanity in 

Indonesia.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The women&#146;s statement released today by ETAN recalls the advance made &#147;last 

year by the decision of the International Tribunal for the Former 

Yugoslavia&#133; classify[ing] rape as a crime against humanity,&#148; and adds, 

&#147;atrocities committed against the people of East Timor deserve no less 

attention.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The release of the statement soon after Mother&#146;s Day and just one week 

before East Timor&#146;s independence is very fitting,&#148; added Farsetta. &#147;We hope 

this strong stand taken by women around the world will be heeded by the 

Security Council and world governments. The mothers of East Timor deserve 

the peace only justice can give them, and the international community has 

an obligation to welcome the birth of the world&#146;s newest country with a 

renewed commitment to justice.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The East Timor Action Network/U.S. is a nationwide grassroots human rights 

organization, which has worked for self-determination, human rights and 

justice for East Timor for the past ten years. The full women&#146;s statement 

and list of signatories can be found on ETAN&#146;s website at

Justice for East Timor Demands an International Tribunal</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Statement from Women&#146;s Studies Scholars,

Women Leaders and Feminist Organizations</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;An International Tribunal is the most pressing demand in the interests of 

justice. Of all the victims of Indonesian military violence the greatest 

suffering was borne by women, who up to this time, have not met with the 

justice they hoped for.&#148;

from a statement by the East Timorese Women&#146;s Network, June 2001</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We join with our East Timorese sisters in calling for an international 

tribunal for East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We urge the United Nations Security Council to establish an international 

tribunal for East Timor without delay. The East Timorese people have waited 

far too long for the architects and perpetrators of the atrocities 

committed against them to be brought to justice. Over two years have passed 

since the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry on East Timor 

called for an international human rights tribunal. During that time, it has 

become clear that only an international tribunal can hold accountable the 

high-ranking Indonesian military, police and government officials most 

responsible for crimes against humanity committed in East Timor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When Indonesia illegally invaded and occupied East Timor in 1975, it began 

a genocidal campaign that lasted nearly a quarter-century. During the first 

five years of the occupation, some 200,000 people  one-third of the 

pre-invasion population  were killed. The occupation specifically targeted 

women in several ways, including the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*       Rape and &#147;forced marriage&#148; to military personnel were used to 

terrorize and control East Timorese women, to punish pro-independence 

families, and to reward Indonesian soldiers. A study of gender violence in 

1999 by the Communication Forum for East Timorese Women (FOKUPERS) found 

many acts of rape were &#147;planned, organized, and sustained  militia and 

soldiers conniving together to abduct women and share them like chattel; 

or, in some cases, forcibly taking women across the border into 

[Indonesian] West Timor where the women were raped daily and made to 

perform household chores.&#148; Tragically, the women among the estimated 60,000 

East Timorese still in Indonesian refugee camps remain vulnerable to sexual 

assault by militia and military members.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*       East Timorese women were forcibly sterilized by the Indonesian 

military under the guise of &#147;family planning&#148;. It is estimated that tens of 

thousands of women were injected with contraceptives without their 

consent  sometimes even without their knowledge  and never with adequate 

follow-up care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*       An unknown number of East Timorese children were kidnapped and 

raised in Indonesia as Indonesian citizens, a practice that continues 

today. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has confirmed 240 

cases of East Timorese children being taken from their parents by militia 

in Indonesian refugee camps since 1999; according to the UN, as many as 

2,000 children may be held captive currently.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the face of such suffering, it is truly reprehensible that the world 

community has knowingly placed its faith in an unacceptable alternative to 

an international tribunal  the Indonesian ad hoc Human Rights Court for 

East Timor. Due to its many flaws, the Indonesian court will not adequately 

address cases of gender violence and the systematic targeting of women and 

children, among other serious crimes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">International justice was significantly advanced last year by the decision 

of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to classify rape as 

a crime against humanity. But the world community cannot stop there. 

Atrocities committed against the people of East Timor deserve no less 

attention than those committed against peoples of other nations. An 

international tribunal for East Timor, with a mandate covering the entire 

Indonesian occupation, must be established now to redress the most heinous 

crimes committed against the women and men of East Timor. Otherwise, 

international justice will appear weak and conditional, rule of law will be 

undermined, and the people of the world&#146;s newest nation will have good 

reason to lose faith in the world community.
