<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SAN FRANCISCO     - May 23 - George the Dinosaur was kicked out of Charles Schwab&#146;s (NYSE: SCH) San Francisco headquarters today when he appeared at lunchtime to request a meeting with Schwab executives to discuss the company&#146;s continued purchasing of office paper and office products from Boise (NYSE: BCC), formerly Boise Cascade. Industry dinosaur Boise refuses to heed public sentiment in support of wilderness and old growth protection and end its barbaric practices of buying and selling products made from old growth, endangered forests and logging on U.S. public lands. Heartsick that Schwab executives refused to meet with him today, George vowed to return the same time next week to try again to meet with the financial giant&#146;s executives. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Apparently Schwab isn&#146;t getting the message that doing business with Boise is bad business,&#148; said George, who is named after Boise CEO George Harad. &#147;I&#146;ll be back at Schwab&#146;s headquarters at noon next Thursday to try again to talk to Schwab executives about what they can do to stop destroying the world&#146;s old growth forests.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Schwab has fallen behind other leading companies including Levi&#146;s Strauss, L.L. Bean, Patagonia and the University of Notre Dame that recently severed their business ties with Boise. Boise has come under increasingly intense public criticism for failing to join more than 400 companies including Kinko&#146;s, Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s in a pledge to stop selling products made from endangered, old growth forests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It&#146;s puzzling that a leading financial services company such as Schwab is so far behind America&#146;s major brands in responding to public support for old growth protection,&#148; said Jennifer Krill, Old Growth Campaign Director, Rainforest Action Network. &#147;Companies in the business with Boise are in the business of old growth destruction, and America&#146;s biggest brands are making it clear that&#146;s a place they don&#146;t want to be.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There exists widespread public support for old growth forest preservation. According to the Los Angeles Times, 9 out of 10 Americans favor preserving our remaining wilderness. Last month, a poll by Davis and Hibbits showed that 70 percent of consumers in traditional timber regions such as Oregon and Washington favor an end to old growth logging. According to a poll by Yankelovich, two out of five consumers would boycott a company that contributed to old growth destruction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Protecting the world&#146;s endangered forests has become as American as baseball and apple pie,&#148; said Michael Brune, Campaigns Director, Rainforest Action Network. &#147;American consumers no longer tolerate the destruction of the world&#146;s remaining old growth forests, and that sentiment is dramatically affecting the market. Boise&#146;s choice is to get out of old growth, or go out of business.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">George the Dinosaur is part of Rainforest Action Network&#146;s (RAN) hard-hitting campaign against Boise for refusing to end its obsolete logging and distribution practices and adopt sustainable forestry principles. Over the next six weeks, George will visit Boise customers across the country to request meetings with executives to discuss the environmental and public image consequences of doing business with Boise. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, RAN is calling on Boise to end its international old growth trade, phase out logging operations on U.S. public lands, and embrace the ecologically and socially responsible principles of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boise actively logs forests on U.S. public lands, is one of America&#146;s largest distributor of wood products from endangered, old growth forests throughout Indonesia, Canada, Central and South America, and Russia, and has been linked to human rights abuses in Guerrero, Mexico. Last year, Boise led the charge against the popular U.S. Roadless Policy, a measure that would have protected 58.5 million acres of America&#146;s public wilderness areas and considered the most significant forest conservation measure of the last 100 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than three-quarters of the world's old growth forests have already been logged or degraded, much within the past three decades. In the United States, less than five percent of our original forests remain. </font></p>
