- May 3 - May 8, 2002 marks the beginning of 

              the 30th year of New York's controversial Rockefeller drug laws, 

              the state's harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws for drug offenders. 

              Numerous events are planned calling on Governor George Pataki to 

              deliver on his promise to adopt meaningful reform of the Rockefeller 

              drug laws, including:

</font>

<ul>

              

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interfaith press conference in Albany. Catholic, Protestant, 

                Muslim and Jewish leaders call on Governor Pataki to reform the 

                unjust Rockefeller drug laws and untie the hands of trial judges, 

                so that they can divert appropriate non-violent drug offenders 

                into community-based drug treatment programs.</font></li>

                Diario</a> and in the Manhattan Times, on May 6th and May 8th 

                promoting the May 8th anniversary rally in Manhattan and asking 

                Governor Pataki to initiate comprehensive reform of the laws. 

              </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A rally outside of Governor Pataki's Manhattan office led by 

                Rev. Al Sharpton, Mothers of the New York Disappeared (mothers 

                with children in prison under these laws), the William Moses Kunstler 

                Fund and JusticeWorks Community (May 8, 12:00 noon, at 40th St.

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 150,000 calls from recorded messages by former Bronx Borough 

                President Fernando Ferrer and potential Presidential candidate 

                Rev. Al Sharpton to New York voters, particularly in minority 

                communities. The calls will urge voters to call Governor Pataki 

                and communicate their support for a drug law reform plan that 

                includes sentencing relief for the thousands of non-violent drug 

                offenders currently serving mandatory sentences -- over 94% of 

                whom are Latino or African-American.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proponents of reform say the current broad consensus to change 

              the Rockefeller Drug Laws offers an unprecedented opportunity to 

              accomplish reform this year. The timing could not be more crucial, 

              given New York's budget crisis, to follow the lead of other states 

              who have saved millions of dollars in taxpayer money by diverting 

              nonviolent drug offenders into community-based treatment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There are three basic components central to any plan to achieve 

              meaningful reform of the Rockefeller drug laws,&quot; says Deborah 

              Small, Director of Public Policy and Community Outreach at Drug 

              Policy Alliance. &quot;One, substantial reduction in the current 

              sentencing scheme with retroactive application for appropriate drug 

              offenders currently incarcerated. Two, untying the hands of judges 

              so that they can send suitable candidates to community-based treatment 

              instead of prison. And three, investing financial resources into 

              drug treatment, job training and education programs as a more effective 

              and inexpensive alternative to prison.&quot; </font></p>
