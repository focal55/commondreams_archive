- August 6 - Texas authorities must commute Mexican national Javier Suarez's death 

sentence or risk defying international law, Amnesty International said today. 

As a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), the United 

States was legally bound to inform Suarez when he was arrested of his right to 

legal assistance from the Mexican government, who could have provided competent 

counsel and thwarted the troubling irregularities in his trial, the organization 

said. Texas currently holds 25 foreign nationals on death row, 17 of whom are 

Mexican citizens. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The US government would never allow one of its citizens to face trial 

and execution in a foreign country without access to US assistance -- and therefore 

must respect Mexico's wishes to halt this execution&quot; said Eric Olson, Americas 

Director for Amnesty International USA (AIUSA.) &quot;The US must respect its 

obligation to international law and commute the death sentence of Javier Suarez.&quot; 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suarez was sentenced to death in 1989 for the murder of undercover police officer 

Lawrence Cadena. His trial was severely flawed. To invoke a death sentence in 

Texas, the jury must unanimously agree that the offender poses a future danger 

to society. The jury based Suarez's propensity to &quot;future dangerousness&quot; 

on an alleged crime that had not been proved in a court and for which there was 

no hard evidence tying Suarez to the crime. Citing these concerns as well as new 

mitigating evidence that Suarez suffers from significant mental disorders, the 

Mexican government has called for the commutation of Suarez's sentence. The European 

Union, Inter-American Human Rights Commission, and the American Bar Association 

have also cited concerns about his case. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Last spring the International Court of Justice ruled against the US for 

defying the VCCR by executing German nationals who had not been informed of their 

rights, yet the US persists in this practice,&quot; said Sue Gunawardena-Vaughn, 

AIUSA's Director of the Program to Abolish the Death Penalty. &quot;The United 

States cannot claim to uphold international law while defying a binding judgment 

from the world's highest court.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a case similar to Suarez's, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruled 

last year to vacate the death sentence of Mexican national Gerardo Valdez because 

local officials also violated his right to consular notification and due to mitigating 

evidence Mexican government officials discovered. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suarez has exhausted all normal avenues of appeal and is scheduled to be executed 

on August 14th. Suarez was 19 years old at the time of the crime; this is his 

14th execution date since 1995.</font></p>
