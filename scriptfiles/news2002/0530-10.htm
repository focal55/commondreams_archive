- May 30 - One hundred sixty-two members of the House or Senate voted in the public interest at least 80 percent of the time in the 107th Congress, with 26 members scoring 100 percent, according to the annual Congressional Scorecard of U.S. Senators and Representatives on major public interest issues released today by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG).  170 members of the House or Senate had scores at 10 percent or below, with 41 members scoring 0 percent.  U.S. PIRG and the State PIRGs will distribute the individualized scorecards to more than one million households across the country this summer as part of a door-to-door campaign to shine the spotlight on recent moves to undermine the nation's key environmental laws and protect our environment and health.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Big-moneyed special interests are spending millions of dollars to pollute the air we breathe, clear-cut our national forests, open the Arctic Refuge to oil drilling, and overturn America's key environmental and public health protections,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Executive Director Gene Karpinski.  &quot;These scorecards are an important tool to educate the public about the voting records of their elected officials and to help citizens hold those officials accountable.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to tracking such diverse public interest votes as protecting the Arctic Refuge from drilling; passing a strong patients' bill of rights, and lowering the costs of student loans, the scorecards also list information about campaign contributions, biographical data, past PIRG scores, and telephone numbers for citizens to contact their elected officials.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We applaud the 162 members who scored 80 percent or more for consistently voting in the public interest,&quot; said Karpinski.  &quot;We are particularly disappointed in the 170 members who consistently voted to put special interests before public health and safety and scored at or below 10 percent.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members who received 100% on the PIRG scorecard were:<br>

Sen. Jack Reed (RI)<br>

Rep. Tammy Baldwin (WI-2)<br>

Rep. Sherrod Brown (OH-13)<br>

Rep. Elijah Cummings (MD-7)<br>

Rep. Diana DeGette (CO-1)<br>

Rep. Michael McNulty (NY-21)<br>

Rep. George Miller (CA-7)<br>

Rep. Donald Payne (NJ-10)<br>

Rep. Tom Udall (NM-3)<br>

Rep. Robert Wexler (FL-19)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 107th Congress has voted on an ongoing series of anti-environmental and anti-consumer measures,&quot; continued Karpinski. &quot;For example, the House voted to open the Arctic Refuge to drilling; the Senate voted to keep SUVs and light trucks from getting better gas mileage; the House and Senate voted to increase &quot;hard money&quot; campaign contributions; and the Senate voted to continue having taxpayers subsidize liability insurance for the nuclear power industry.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We urge members of Congress to make protecting America's environment a top priority - preserving our last wild forests, cleaning up polluting power plants, defending the Superfund and the nation's other environmental and public health protections enacted over the last three decades,&quot; concluded Karpinski.</font></p>
