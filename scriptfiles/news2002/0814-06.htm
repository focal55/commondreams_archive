Director of the Colombia program at the Center for International Policy, Isacson 

said today: &quot;At a time when a new hardline president is declaring a state 

of emergency in Colombia, the U.S. government is broadening its military mission 

from counter-narcotics to counter-terrorism. This could lead just about anyplace. 

Those two trends are worrying enough on their own, but for them to happen at the 

same time should make us sit up.&quot;</font></p>

Co-founder and director of the Colombia Support Network, Zarate-Laun said today: 

&quot;Colombia's new government has issued a decree that installed a state of 

emergency. It is instituting detentions without warrants and creating a network 

of informants, which violates the constitution. Meanwhile, the interior minister 

is pressuring the constitutional courts... Fighting against terrorism is not only 

a right; it is a duty of the government. However the government cannot be allowed 

to solve the Colombia conflict by restricting fundamental freedoms and democratic 

rights.&quot;</font></p>

<a href="mailto:abukhali@toto.csustan.edu">abukhali@toto.csustan.edu</a><br>

AbuKhalil's recent criticism of the Jordanian monarchy on the Al-Jazeera network 

prompted a number of actions by the Jordanian government -- including closing 

down the offices of Al-Jazeera in Jordan. He said today: &quot;The stiff Jordanian 

reaction to my criticism of the record of the royal family and its double dealings 

toward the Palestinians indicates a measure of the nervousness and insecurity 

on the part of the king, who wishes to balance his blind loyalty to the U.S. with 

the sentiments of his largely Palestinian populace. The role of the intelligence 

apparatus has been expanded under this king, and dissidents are quickly rounded 

up.... The U.S. is working toward affecting the succession struggle in Saudi Arabia: 

The pro-U.S. faction under Prince Sultan, who is the defense minister and father 

of the Saudi Ambassador in D.C., wants Prince Sultan to be made the Crown Prince, 

while Crown Prince Abdullah wants the traditional standard of chronological seniority 

to be observed.&quot; Author of &quot;Bin Laden, Islam &amp; America's New 'War 

on Terrorism'&quot; and professor of political science at California State University 

at Stanislaus, AbuKhalil has recently returned from the Mideast.</font></p>
