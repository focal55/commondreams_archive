<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- June 10 - The nonprofit Clean Air 

Trust today assailed what it called a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; plan by the 

Bush administration to weaken emission standards for big diesel 

trucks and buses. 

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bush plan was quietly unveiled in a statement late last 

Friday. Described as an &quot;unusual collaboration&quot; between the 

Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Office of 

Management and Budget, the Bush plan could permit diesel engine 

makers to &quot;trade emission-reduction credits&quot; rather than produce 

cleaner trucks and buses. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This industry-friendly plan is a Trojan Horse,&quot; said Frank 

O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust. &quot;In the 

guise of a cleanup plan, it would actually permit industry to evade 

the tough diesel truck standards set by the Clinton 

administration.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Previously, EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman had 

supported the Clinton truck standards, O'Donnell noted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is disturbing that she is apparently now backing away from 

her promises -- and from those much-needed truck standards,&quot; said 

O'Donnell. &quot;It is equally disturbing that Whitman appears to be 

abdicating her authority -- and permitting OMB to run her agency.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell's comments came as state and local air pollution 

regulators unveiled a new report that points out the massive health 

caused by emissions from dirty diesel engines used off the highway. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report concludes that tough emission and fuel controls on 

these so-called &quot;non-road&quot; diesels could prevent more than 8,500 

premature deaths and 180,000 asthma attacks a year. (Non-road 

diesels include such machines as construction equipment, bulldozers 

and portable diesel generators.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report vividly underscores the massive health damage 

caused by non-road diesel engines,&quot; said Frank O'Donnell, executive 

director of the Clean Air Trust. &quot;It is high time that we close 

the dirty diesel loophole that permits non-road diesel engines to 

emit much higher levels of pollution than diesel trucks and buses.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He added that non-road diesel fuel contains high levels of 

poisonous sulfur. &quot;Non-road diesel fuel literally contains 200 

times the sulfur that will be allowed in highway diesel fuel in 

2006,&quot; said O'Donnell. &quot;Much of that sulfur is chemically 

converted to dangerous fine particle soot. The sulfur also prevents 

use of pollution control devices,&quot; O'Donnell noted. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That's why health and environmental and state and local 

government groups have called on EPA to set standards for non-road 

diesel engines and fuel to match the progressive standards for 

highway trucks and highway diesel fuel,&quot; O'Donnell said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O'Donnell noted that existing emission standards for non-road 

diesel engines are &quot;pitifully weak&quot; and that non-road diesel fuel 

remains unregulated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's study was released by two organizations representing 

state and local clean-air regulators, The State and Territorial Air 

Pollution Program Administrators and the Association of Local Air 

Pollution Control Officials (STAPPA/ALAPCO). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study concludes that setting standards for non-road diesel 

engines and fuel comparable to highway engine and fuel standards 

would prevent more than 8,500 premature deaths a year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It would also prevent more than 180,000 asthma attacks each and 

would bring an estimated $64 billion in health benefits. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Cleaning up non-road diesel engines is a no-brainer,&quot; said 

O'Donnell. &quot;It is simply a matter of environmental equity.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Clean Air Trust is updating a Web site, 

<a href="http://www.cleanupdiesel.org" target="_new">www.cleanupdiesel.org</a>, to allow the public to communicate directly 

with EPA on the need to clean up non-road diesel engines. The 

Trust used the same web site two years ago to help people send 

comments to EPA on the need to clean up trucks and buses. </i></font></p>
