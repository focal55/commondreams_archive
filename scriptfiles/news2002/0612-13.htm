<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- June 12 - The nonprofit Clean Air 
Trust today named Catholic Charities of Cleveland as the clean air 
&quot;villain of the month&quot; for June 2002. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Ohio-based group was cited because it testified today in the 
United States Senate in opposition to legislation aimed at reducing 
harmful pollution from coal-burning electric power plants. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Catholic Charities' testimony &quot;raises numerous questions,&quot; 
said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catholic Charities' position was &quot;truly startling,&quot; said 
O'Donnell, because its eight-county service area in Northeast Ohio 
includes 185,000 people who suffer from asthma, including 36,000 
children, according to American Lung Association statistics. Nearly 
all of these children live in neighborhoods hardest hit by pollution 
generated by power plants in the Cleveland area. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Cleveland area regularly experiences unhealthful levels of 
ozone, or smog. For example, in 2000, the Cleveland area recorded 39 
days with unhealthful levels of smog. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a hearing today before the Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee, the president of Cleveland Catholic Charities Health and 
Human Services complained about the high cost of electricity and its 
impact on the poor. He asserted that cleanup legislation sponsored 
by Senator Jim Jeffords (I-Vt.) would have a &quot;negative impact on 
millions of people in our country and in my state of Ohio.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell noted that the Catholic Charities president cited only 
statistics provided by the electric power industry's lobbying arm, 
the Edison Electric Institute. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This creates the unfortunate appearance that Catholic Charities 
of Cleveland was acting as a front for the electric power industry,&quot; 
said O'Donnell. &quot;It also raises questions about its connections to 
the electric power industry.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell noted that it was a &quot;curious coincidence&quot; that the 
group's fund-raising arm, Catholic Diocese of Cleveland Foundation, 
includes on its board of trustees one H. Peter Burg, chairman and CEO 
of FirstEnergy Corp., which is being sued by the Justice Department 
for alleged violations of air pollution requirements. FirstEnergy is 
a prominent member of the Edison Electric Institute. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FirstEnergy's PAC (to which Burg has contributed) has given 2002 
cycle campaign contributions to several senators on the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee, including Sens. George 
Voinovich (R-Ohio), Bob Smith (R-N.H.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Arlen 
Specter (R-Pa.) and Bob Graham (D-Fla.). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Privately, Burg has also contributed this campaign cycle to 
Senator Bob Smith, to the Edison Electric Institute's PAC, to Sen. 
Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) and to various members of the House of 
Representatives. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catholic Charities of Cleveland is no stranger to political 
controversy. In 2000, it hosted presidential campaigner George Bush, 
who was then reeling from primary defeats by John McCain and a 
controversial speech that Bush had made at Bob Jones University. 
Bush used a Catholic Charities facility to make another speech that 
helped right his campaign right before the crucial &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; 
primaries. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much of Catholic Charities' budget comes from the federal 
government in the form of contracts. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catholic Charities of Cleveland also gave an award in 2000 to 
Senator Voinovich, who apparently arranged for the group to testify 
today. </font></p>
