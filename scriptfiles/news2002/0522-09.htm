<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AUSTIN, TX - May 22 -  Two of the most powerful institutional shareholder voices in America &shy; Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the California Public Employee Retirement System (CalPERS) &shy; are supporting resolutions filed by shareholders concerned about the intransigence of Exxon

Mobil (XOM) on climate-change issues.   The separate announcements by

CalPERS and ISS echo a growing concern among investors about ExxonMobil and come just days before the oil giant's shareholders gather on May 29th in Dallas, Texas.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rev. Michael Crosby of the St. Joseph of the Capuchin Order of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said:  &quot;It is already clear that 2002 is going to be remembered as the year that institutional investors sat up and took notice of the global warming issue.  We've seen that happen at other major energy companies that already have held their 2002 shareholder meetings.  Now, it's time for the message to be taken to ExxonMobil, which is America's largest oil company and the single biggest corporate roadblock in the world standing in the path of responsible global warming reforms.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Peter Altman, national coordinator of Campaign ExxonMobil said:  &quot;We are very pleased that ISS and CalPERS agree that ExxonMobil needs to provide shareholders more information on its decisions about renewable energy. The company has staked out a position that puts shareholders at risk and isn't telling them why. This is a first step in compelling this company to disclose its rationale on the whole issue of global warming.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Altman added: &quot;As the nation's largest public pension fund with assets totaling more than $150 billion, CalPERS is a voice that cannot be ignored, Institutional Shareholder Services gained widespread recognition with the Compaq-Hewlett Packard merger for its ability to influence the thinking of institutional investors and we are hoping to see that same kind of influential impact here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of particular interest on the global warming front are two resolutions before ExxonMobil shareholders.  The executive compensation proposal (#6) asks the company to consider non-financial factors, including social and environmental concerns, in determining compensation for top executives. The renewable energy resolution proposal (#8) asks the company to report on its plans to promote renewable energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CalPERS indicated that it is supporting both the proposal calling on ExxonMobil to consider environmental and social factors in setting executive compensation levels, as well as the proposal calling on the company to report on plans to promote renewable energy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Institutional Shareholder Services indicated that it would urge XOM shareholders to support the renewable energy resolution. In its analysis, ISS stated: &quot;the company could be placing itself in jeopardy, and shareholders as well, if there were to be a sudden policy change mandating the increased use of renewable energy resources. In addition, the company could be missing out on profitable opportunities by not investing in renewable energy sources, which could result in decreased shareholder value.&quot; ISS tracks 20,000 U.S. and foreign companies for almost1,000 institutional and corporate clients.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growing support for the resolutions reflects the increased awareness investors have that ExxonMobil is making decisions with unclear benefits and very clear risks. The ISS analysis referred to a Claros Consulting study released on May 2, 2002 in London. &quot;Risking Shareholder Value? ExxonMobil and Climate Change&quot;, which was commissioned by shareholder activist Robert A.G. Monks, the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES)

and Campaign ExxonMobil.   According to the Claros study, ExxonMobil's

attitude toward climate change is fraught with &quot;unnecessary risks and missed opportunities&quot; that could put at risk more than $100 billion in long-term shareholder value in the company.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At ExxonMobil's 2001 annual shareholder meeting, 9.5% of shareholders voted in support of the executive compensation resolution and 8.9 of shareholders

voted for the renewable energy resolutions.   The votes reflected roughly

$26 - $29 billion worth of Exxon Mobil stock.The SEC requires a 10% vote for proposals to be brought back a third year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Campaign ExxonMobil was founded by religious institutional shareholders and environmental groups concerned about the oil industry giant's risky handling of the issue of global warming and the financial threats posed by delaying solutions.  Religious shareholders are joined in Campaign ExxonMobil by socially responsible investors, public pension funds and descendants of the individuals who helped build Exxon.</font></p>
