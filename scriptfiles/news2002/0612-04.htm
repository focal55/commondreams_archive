- June 12 - As the U.S. Senate 
prepares to vote on estate tax repeal, the Americans for a Fair 
Estate Tax today released a new poll that shows nearly two out of 
three Americans support reform over repeal. </FONT>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A broad majority of Americans support reforming the estate tax 
to protect small business owners and family farms over permanent 
repeal that gives more tax breaks to multi-millionaires at the 
expense of 98 percent of taxpayers,&quot; said Senator Kent Conrad at a 
press conference today at the U.S. Capitol. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The poll, conducted on Americans' perceptions of estate tax 
repeal, found that after hearing balanced arguments on this issue, 
58 percent of likely voters support reform that protects small 
business owners and family farms while only 37 percent support 
repeal of the estate tax. When voters learn more about the issue, 
support for reform grows to more than two to one. By a margin of 
67 to 27 percent, Americans support reform over repeal once they 
hear more information about who pays the estate tax and what repeal 
of the tax would cost. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As early as today, the U.S. Senate is looking to pass harmful 
legislation that will shift tax burdens from the two percent of the 
super-wealthy to the 98 percent of Americans not now paying the 
estate tax,&quot; said William Gates Sr. of Responsible Wealth, a 
national network of affluent Americans advocating shared 
prosperity. &quot;Congress should reject the notion of wholesale repeal 
in the short term because it is fiscally reckless, and in the long 
term because we recognize the importance of protecting our 
democracy from a further buildup of hereditary wealth.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The poll also found that tax cuts rank six out of eight 
priorities for the federal budget. Cuts in the estate tax rank 
dead last among tax cut alternatives offered, a result consistent 
with polling conducted by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal 
since 1998. Furthermore, voters are sharply focused on priorities 
that benefit all Americans -- including increasing spending for 
education and health care, and strengthening Social Security and 
Medicare. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The proposal to permanently repeal the estate tax is fiscally 
irresponsible,&quot; said Gary D. Bass, executive director of OMB Watch 
and chair of Americans for a Fair Estate Tax. &quot;Instead of a tax 
break for multi-millionaires, we should honor our commitments to 
strengthen Medicare and Social Security, improve education, and 
fight terrorism.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under current law, estates of up to $3.5 million for any 
individual or $7 million for a couple will be exempt from any 
estate tax when the reforms are fully phased in by 2009. The 
proposal in the U.S. Senate would permanently repeal the tax and 
would cost $850 billion over the next two decades and $56 billion 
in the first full year of repeal. This provides relief to an 
extremely limited number of Americans. For example, just 24 estates 
in Maine, 54 estates in Louisiana, and 129 estates in Missouri 
would receive relief. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Charlotte L. McConnell, executive director of 
Family and Child Services of Washington, D.C. and an Americans for 
a Fair Estate Tax member, permanent repeal would have an adverse 
affect on charities. It would affect government resources 
available for service delivery as well as charitable giving. The 
estate tax generated $15 billion in charitable bequests in 1999. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At a time when resources are needed at the community level, it 
is wrong to repeal the estate tax. We should not provide a tax 
break for the wealthiest Americans when services to families are 
not adequately funded,&quot; said McConnell. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About the Poll: The national survey was of 1,000 likely voters 
conducted May 6-9, 2002 by Greenberg. Quinlan, &amp; Rosner Research. 
The findings have a margin of error of +/- 3.1 percent. </font></p>
