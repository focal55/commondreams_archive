- April 26 - Michael D. Barnes,

president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence united with

the Million Mom March, today issued the following statement

regarding the National Rifle Association's (NRA) announcement that

Senator Zell Miller (D-Ga.) will be the keynote speaker at the

NRA's annual convention to be held in Reno, Nev. April 26-28:

<p>"As America struggles to increase national security, Senator

Miller and other lawmakers should be acting on measures that will

make our communities more secure rather than courting the NRA -- an

extreme special interest that is systematically working to

dismantle sensible gun laws that have proven to save lives.

<p>"The NRA leadership does not represent the views of mainstream

Americans. Rather than working to prevent gun violence, the NRA

fights to keep military-style assault weapons -- high-powered

weapons with no civilian purpose -- easily available and on our

streets. NRA leaders repeatedly demonize America's law enforcement

officers, most infamously calling federal agents 'jack-booted

thugs' for enforcing our nation's gun laws. Are these the

so-called 'values' our lawmakers want to espouse?

<p>"Before Senator Miller's colleagues rush to embrace his belief

that supporting sensible gun laws loses elections, they should look

around the Senate chamber to note the presence of Senators -- like

Bill Nelson of Florida, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Maria

Cantwell of Washington -- who vocally supported sensible gun policy

during their campaigns, and the glaring absence of those who

opposed life-saving gun policy measures. The last two elections

demonstrate that Americans want common-sense gun laws and they will

support elected officials who pursue them.

<p>"Despite outspending the gun control movement by a margin of

five to one in the 2000 elections, the NRA lost five of the top

seven U.S. Senate candidates it backed with independent

expenditures, and seven of the top nine House races it targeted.

In contrast, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence succeeded

in defeating nine out of 12 'Dangerous Dozen' candidates we

targeted. And two traditionally pro-gun Western states, Colorado

and Oregon, overwhelmingly approved citizen-led statewide ballot

initiatives to close the gun show loophole.

<p>"In 2001, James McGreevy highlighted gun policy in his

successful bid to become Governor of New Jersey. In Virginia,

strong support from gun violence prevention advocates in Northern

Virginia, including the Million Mom March, helped to secure Mark

Warner's victory.

<p>"Poll after poll shows that the vast majority of Americans,

including gun owners, support sensible gun laws. Past is prologue,

and Democrats and Republicans who want to win elections would do

well to listen to their constituents and address gun violence

prevention issues in their upcoming campaigns."

<p>Recent Gun Trends:

<p>-- Requests for Background Checks down -- The NRA has also been

promoting the idea that gun sales have skyrocketed since September

11 -- a claim exposed as fiction when the Christian Science Monitor

reported on April 2 that background checks requests are declining.

Specifically, FBI statistics cited in the April 2, 2002 edition of

the Christian Science Monitor, requests for background checks on

<p>gun sales have fallen over the last two years. This is despite the

brief increase in background checks that was reported after the

September 11 terrorist attacks. (For the full story go to:

<p>-- Handgun Sales in California at 30-Year Low -- Handgun sales

in California last year dropped to the lowest level since the state

began keeping records 30 years ago, according to new data from the

state Department of Justice. The sharp downward trend began in the

mid-1990s. Handgun sales have fallen by 65 percent since they

peaked nearly 10 years ago, even as the state's population has

swelled by 70 percent from about 20 million in 1972 to over 34

million today. (To view the Brady Campaign's press release go to:

<p>-- NRA Efforts to Weaken "Concealed-Carry" Laws Floundering --

In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the NRA has been

trying to exploit the public's understandable fears by pushing

state legislatures into weakening their laws on the carrying of

concealed weapons. Fortunately, the NRA's efforts to weaken

concealed-carry laws have been defeated in Nebraska and Wisconsin

and face defeat in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri. Even

Southern states that would be considered NRA strongholds, like

Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, have

rejected its attempts to allow concealed weapons in schools,

churches and bars.
