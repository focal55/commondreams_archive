YORK - July 17 - Only a mere one-third of the drop in the welfare caseload can 
be attributed to families successfully earning their way off welfare and out of 
poverty, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data released 
last month.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the number of families receiving welfare benefits shrunk by approximately 
2.2 million between 1995 and 1999, there was a simultaneous 1.4 million increase 
in the number of impoverished families eligible for, yet not receiving, welfare 
benefits.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;This discredits all we have been told about welfare reform,&#8221; said 
Lisa Maatz, vice president of NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, &#8220;What&#8217;s 
been deemed a success is simply an inability to get assistance to those who desperately 
need it.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The data reflect a massive decline in the participation rate -- the percentage 
of families who are eligible for welfare that actually receive benefits. Since 
welfare reform was enacted, the participation rate has plummeted from 84% in 1995 
to 52% in 1999. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Instead of praising welfare reform as a magic elixir for poverty,&#8221; 
said Maatz, &#8220;we need to find out how and why welfare reform has placed a 
new barrier between people in poverty and the help promised them by the government.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maatz suggested possible reasons why eligible families would not access the 
welfare program include confusing bureaucratic processes and less meaningful benefits.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The data was included in the annual report &#8220;Indicators of Welfare Dependence,&#8221; 
submitted to Congress June 3. The full report is available at &lt;<a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators02/index.htm" target="_new">http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/indicators02/index.htm</a>&gt;.</font></p>
