- June 25 - World Wildlife Fund will recognize the efforts of two outstanding 
women for their role in conservation at an awards ceremony on June 26 in Washington, 
DC. Sushila Nepali of Nepal and Patricia Skyer of Namibia were selected to receive 
this year's awards for their conservation work in their native countries. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Sushila and Patricia have made important and lasting
contributions to conservation. Not only are they effective
stewards of our natural world, they are wonderful role models for
other women seeking to make a difference," said Kathryn S. Fuller,
president of World Wildlife Fund.
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is the second year that WWF has presented the Women and
Conservation Awards. These awards acknowledge exceptional
achievement in two categories -- a woman's contribution to
conservation and an individual or organization's contribution to
enhancing women's participation in conservation. Each of this
year's winners will receive a cash award of $5,000 to be used for
conservation activities in their countries.
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sushila Nepali has been an effective and committed leader in
mobilizing local communities and governmental and non-governmental
organizations for biodiversity conservation work for 18 years.
Nepali began working with the WWF Nepal Program in 1997 as a
consultant to prepare the Buffer Zone management plan for the Royal
Bardia National Park. Beginning in 1998, she worked as an assistant
project manager for the Bardia Integrated Conservation Project
(BICP) implemented by WWF Nepal Program. Under her leadership, BICP
was one of the most successful models of integrated conservation
and development in Nepal. Nepali is currently the project
co-manager of the Terai Arc Landscape in the Department of National
Parks and Wildlife Conservation program. She is one of the few
Nepalese women working with local communities for conservation at
a grassroots level under very difficult circumstances. Nepali will
receive the Women and Conservation Recognition Award for
contribution to enhancing women's participation in conservation.
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Patricia Skyer has a distinguished conservation career marked by
numerous, profound program achievements. Skyer joined WWF's
Community-based Natural Resources Management (CBNRM) program in
Namibia in 1996, working as a community development officer for the
Living in a Finite Environment (LIFE) program. She was one of the
first formerly disadvantaged Namibian women to join the program as
a technical facilitator at the national level. In 2001, Skyer
became the secretariat coordinator of the Namibia Association of
CBNRM Support Organizations. Under her leadership to date, 15
conservancies have been registered by the government, providing
their legal status and directly involving more than 33,000 people
and more than four million hectares of land in a national
conservation movement. Skyer will receive the Women and
Conservation Recognition Award for contribution by a woman to the
field of conservation.
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WWF established the Women and Conservation Initiative to
recognize and expand the critical roles women play in using and
managing natural resources -- growing food crops and cultivating
home gardens, collecting water and fuelwood for household needs,
and using forest products to make foods, medicines and goods for
sale as well as participate in forest and protected area
management. The program emphasizes women's involvement in
conservation through improving their economic outlook, enhancing
their knowledge and skills, and advancing their participation in
making decisions about their environments, especially in and around
the Global 200, habitats that WWF has designated as conservation
priorities.
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Through the Women and Conservation Initiative, World Wildlife
Fund seeks to raise the profile of the conservation work done by
extraordinary women around the world," Fuller said.
</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the recognition awards, the Women and
Conservation Initiative offers gender training, technical
assistance, and development of tools to assist field staff in
increasing women's participation in conservation strategies. A
small grants fund that supports women and conservation programs in
WWF ecoregions and a Girls' Scholarships Program to support
secondary education for girls have also been established through
the program.
