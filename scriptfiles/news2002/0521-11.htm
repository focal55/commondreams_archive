- May 21 - On May 13, Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri called for a temporary moratorium on logging in Indonesia in an effort to halt illegal logging and save what&#146;s left of the country&#146;s remaining forests. According to the World Bank, Indonesia will lose all of its forests in the next 15 years if the government does not act quickly and strongly against deforestation activities.   </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The President&#146;s endorsement of a moratorium on logging is a welcome sign of political support for saving Indonesia&#146;s endangered forests. It falls short, however, of providing meaningful protection of Indonesia&#146;s remaining forests. Until it is implemented, vast amount of forest destruction will continue by legal Indonesian timber companies supplying U.S. timber and home improvement companies including Boise Cascade (NYSE: BCC), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Lowe&#146;s (NYSE: LOW) and Georgia Pacific (NYSE: GP).   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time the President endorsed the call for a moratorium, the Ministry of Forests ordered an end to logging in forest areas already degraded to less than 75 cubic meters of commercial timber per hectare. This allows legal logging to continue in primary forests where legal timber companies are currently most active, rather than restricting it to plantations and secondary forests in an effort to foster sustainable forestry.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boise Cascade, Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s, and Georgia Pacific continue to buy Indonesian wood products ranging from plywood and tool handles to and flooring and furniture. It is estimated that up to 70 percent of wood used by these Indonesian timber companies comes from illegal sources and that the companies use false documents and fraud to hide the fact that their timber was illegally logged.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Home Depot and Lowe&#146;s have taken preliminary steps to phase out the buying and selling of wood from endangered forests, but continue to buy products made from Indonesia&#146;s forests.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Not a single Indonesian timber distributor, including U.S. companies, can be trusted to be clean of illegal wood, considering the levels of illegal log laundering,&#148; said Jessica Lawrence, Rainforest Action Network. &#147;American companies need to heed the President&#146;s call to save Indonesia&#146;s forests by stopping all purchasing of Indonesian wood until the country&#146;s logging industry has worked out its problems under a logging moratorium.&#148;   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current laws also allow the continued conversion of Indonesia&#146;s natural forests to palm oil plantations and pulpwood. Palm oil plantations alone have claimed nearly 8 million acres of native forest in Indonesia. The increase in pulp and paper processing has outpaced the development of sustainable managed pulpwood plantations, resulting in widespread forest destruction.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the Rainforest Action Network and Indonesian environmentalists, a moratorium on all additional conversion of forests to plantations is also urgently needed, as forests continue to fall for the expansion of palm oil plantations and pulpwood operations backed by U.S. financial giant, Citigroup (NYSE: C).   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citigroup, North America&#146;s largest financial institution, is a key financial backer of palm oil plantations and pulp and paper operations in Indonesia. It is business partners with Indonesian palm oil company, London Sumatra (Lon Sum), a company that has been implicated in bulldozing and burning vast areas of forests, as well as violating the human rights of indigenous peoples. Citigroup is also a top investor in Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), one of Indonesia&#146;s largest and most destructive pulp and paper operators.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Citigroup is a perfect example of a U.S. company supporting and profiting from the destruction of Indonesia&#146;s forests and communities,&#148; said Ms. Lawrence. &#147;Unless U.S. companies like Citigroup join President Megawati&#146;s call to save the Indonesia&#146;s forests, the situation will only worsen.&#148;  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indonesian forest destruction poses a grave danger to Indonesia&#146;s indigenous peoples who face displacement from their traditional territories, and to Indonesia&#146;s wildlife including endangered tigers, elephants, rhinos, and orangutans. For example, the orangutan population has declined by 50 percent in the last decade, primarily due to destruction of its forest habitat, up to 80 percent of which has been lost in the last 20 years.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until 1985, Indonesia was covered by 143 million hectares of forests. By 2000 that number had declined drastically to a mere 20 million hectares due to excessive logging. Between 1885 and 1997, 1.5 million hectare of Indonesian forests were lost each year. The situation has worsened in the past ten years, with excessive logging destroying an astounding 1.7 to 2 million hectares of Indonesia&#146;s forests annually. </font></p>
