Executive director of TransAfrica, Fletcher said today: "Bush not being at the Earth Summit

in South Africa is extremely symbolic. It is a reflection of the arrogance of

this administration and its unilateralism. The Summit is perhaps most

noteworthy for the events of the popular organizations and NGOs which are

trying to address the growing disparity of wealth and the failure of the global

North to deal with environmental degradation. I hope that Powell is hearing

this, though it would have been better for Bush to hear it himself. Powell is

also scheduled to go to Angola. I wish he were going to offer meaningful

reconstruction assistance for the recently-ended civil war, which was ignited

by U.S. intervention in 1975. Unfortunately, the reason Powell is going there

probably has to do with oil; as the administration gears up for this

illegitimate war with Iraq, it wants to secure other sources of oil.... Reports

that the current African drought and the last African drought may be directly

related to industrial air pollution on the part of the global North demonstrate

how interconnected this planet is and the fact that we, in the global North,

cannot go about acting as if our actions have no global consequences. This

drought has directly affected the gravity of the famine, as has the

misdirection that some Southern African countries have received from economic

advisors in the global North."</p>

Director of the 50 Years Is Enough Network, Njehu has just returned from the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), or Earth Summit, in Johannesburg, South Africa.

She is among the participants today in a news conference organized by the

Mobilization For Global Justice in Washington, D.C., looking ahead to the

International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings at the end of September in

Washington and planned protests at that time. She said today: "Institutions

like the IMF, World Bank and WTO have taken over the WSSD process.... What is

clear from Johannesburg is that civil society is not waiting on governments or

international agencies to help them survive corporate globalization...."</p>

Executive director of Africa Action, Booker said today: "In the decade that has passed since

the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, pledges made then have largely been

abandoned, and environmental degradation and poverty have deepened in Africa

and around the world. Development assistance from the wealthy to the developing

world has also declined during this period.... In an attempt to stem criticism

of President Bush's failure to attend the WSSD, Secretary Powell will be

announcing a supposedly new $4 billion proposal on aid to Africa, to support

disease control programs, clean water and sanitation projects, and

environmental conservation. However, far from illustrating a U.S. commitment to

Africa, this announcement is largely a hoax. Up to half of this money has

already been approved or announced earlier, while the balance is based upon

projections of future hypothetical appropriations, spread over several years.

This is the administration's form of Enron / Arthur Andersen-style

accounting."</p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center">###</p>
