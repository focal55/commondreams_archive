- January 9 -  In what promises to be a powerfully cathartic journey for peace, US

citizens who lost loved ones on September 11 will travel to

Afghanistan to meet with people whose family members died during the

conflict in Afghanistan. The historic emotional exchange between

victims' families represents a small but significant step toward

building the bonds of friendship that are the true foundations of peace.



<p>

Four people who lost loved ones on September 11 will leave for

Afghanistan on Saturday, January 12. They will arrive in Islamabad,

Pakistan on January 14 and then travel to Kabul, Afghanistan on

January 15. The victims' families will spend up to eight days in

Afghanistan meeting with those who are also suffering the grief of

loss. While in Afghanistan, the US visitors will meet with street

children who lost their parents during the recent bombing, visit a

hospital in Kabul, and help an Afghan family rebuild their home.



<p>

"For me, this trip is about respect and love for all human beings by

all human beings, regardless of where they come from," says Derrill

Bodley, a music professor from Stockton, California whose daughter,

Deora, died on United Airlines Flight 93. "I'm going on this journey

to show my concern for those innocent Afghans who have died or are

suffering now. By embracing our common humanity and sharing our sorrow

perhaps we will be able to avoid other loss in the future."



<p>

The victims-to-victims delegation is being organized by Global

Exchange, an international human rights organization whose motto is

'building people-to-people ties.' Global Exchange hopes the meeting

will have a profound impact in both countries by showing that

individual Afghans and Americans suffer alike. Afghans will see that

US citizens do care about their well being. The US visitors will gain

a deeper understanding of Afghans as real people. And people around

the world who learn of the exchange will get to witness the common

humanity of all persons.



<p>

The four US citizens who will travel to Afghanistan are:



<p>

<b>Derrill Bodley</b> is a 56-year-old professor of music at Sacramento City

College and the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.

Derrill lost his daughter, Deora, on United Airlines Flight 93, which

crashed in Pennsylvania. His first response to the tragedy was a

musical composition that came to him as he sat at his piano on

September 13. Called "Steps to Peace--For Deora," he played this music

at a White House tribute and gave a copy of the CD to President Bush.



<p>

<b>Rita Lasar</b> is a 70-year-old retired small businesswoman from New York.

Rita lost her brother, Abe Zelmanowitz, at the World Trade Center. Abe

was on the 27th floor of 1 World Trade Center when the first plane

hit. Although he could have gotten out of the building, he chose

instead to stay with his friend, a quadriplegic who could not get out.

President Bush mentioned Abe's heroism during his speech honoring the

victims at the National Cathedral.



<p>

<b>Kelly Campbell</b> is a 29-year-old environmental campaign coordinator 

in Oakland California. Her brother-in-law, 28 year-old Craig Amundson,

was killed in the Pentagon attack, leaving behind a young wife and two

small children. Kelly is travelling on behalf of Craig's widow, Amber

Amundson, who has been an outspoken voice for reconciliation. In the

weeks after the attack, Amber wrote in the Chicago Tribune: "My

anguish is compounded exponentially by fear that [Craig's] death will

be used to justify new violence against other innocent victims."



<p>

<b>Eva Rupp</b> is a 28-year-old woman who works in Washington DC at the

Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration. Eva is the step sister of Deora Bodley, and the two of

them were close from the time Deora was five. "I'm going to

Afghanistan because I hope to build more understanding between Afghans

and Americans, and increase the potential for positive relationships

between us," Rupp says. 



<p>

A full accounting of civilian casualties from the US bombing campaign

has not yet occurred, but reports from human rights organizations and

academics place the number of innocent Afghan victims at between 2,000

and 4,000 people. At the very least, it is clear from news reports

that thousands of people were either maimed or killed by US air strikes.



<p>

"The people of the United States, indeed the world, have shown

tremendous compassion for the families of the victims of September 11.

Shouldn't our hearts and helping hands also go out to those Afghans

who are as every bit innocent as the victims of September 11?" says

Medea Benjamin, founding director of Global Exchange. Ms. Benjamin

will accompany the family members to Afghanistan. "Don't we, as

citizens of a wealthy nation that unleashed deadly force against

Afghanistan, have a moral responsibility to help Afghanistan's

innocent victims?"
