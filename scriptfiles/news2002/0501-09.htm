- May 1 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both in Florida and across the country, millions of Americans 

were denied their right to vote in the November 2000 election. It 

was an embarrassing spectacle that led to an outcry from many 

elected leaders, commentators and editorial writers. But when 

nearly 600,000 people --many of whom live only minutes from the 

U.S. Capitol -- have no one who is able to vote on their behalf on 

the issues in Congress, it's doesn't make the headlines. In fact, 

for the citizens of the District of Columbia, it's just another 

day. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas will join 

elected officials and leaders of civil rights organizations this 

Thursday, May 2 for a news conference at noon, calling on Congress 

to end this injustice by passing the &quot;No Taxation Without 

Representation&quot; Act. The Act is being introduced by the District 

of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes 

Norton, and would require full voting representation in the U.S. 

House and Senate on behalf of District of Columbia residents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizens of the District of Columbia pull more than their fair 

share of civic responsibility by providing critical skills that 

enable government to function effectively, serving in the nation's military in times of war, and paying nearly $3 billion in federal 

income taxes each year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So far, more than 100 members of the House have already signed 

on as co-sponsors of the &quot;No Taxation Without Representation&quot; Act. 

By passing the Act, Congress can extend representative democracy to 

the citizens of D.C. </font></p>
