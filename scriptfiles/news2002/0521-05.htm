- May 21 - Members of the food industry 

and scientists came together today to announce their joint effort to 

save from extinction a delicacy whose overnight trendiness has proven 

to be its downfall. Over 100 of New York's top restaurants, 

retailers, caterers and suppliers took the first step today towards 

saving Chilean Sea Bass by pledging to not serve or sell the fish 

until its population stabilizes. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile in LA today, nearly 100 Southern California chefs also 

committed to &quot;Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass.&quot; Campanile, Ciudad, 

Patina, Spago Beverly Hills and Water Grill are among the famous 

California eateries who are encouraging fellow chefs and diners to 

help protect the species. &quot;Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass&quot;, a 

national campaign by National Environmental Trust and The Antarctica 

Project now covers the country's major food markets, including San 

Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New York area businesses that have signed on to the campaign 

include (complete list available): </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACME Smoked Fish Corp. * 

Artisanal 

Craft/CraftBar * 

La Grenouille * 

Mesa Grill 

* Oceana Restaurant 

* The Grand Central Oyster Bar 

* The Sea Grill 

* Union Square Cafe </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're taking Chilean Sea Bass off our menu so we can enjoy it in 

the future,&quot; said Edward Brown, executive chef of The Sea Grill. 

Brown prepared several examples of seafood dishes that consumers and 

cooks can enjoy as alternatives to Chilean sea bass. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a supplier for restaurants, deli's, specialty food and grocery 

stores in the country, I feel I have a responsibility to purchase 

sustainable seafood,&quot; said Robert Caslow, owner of Brooklyn-based 

ACME Smoked Fish Corporation and Blue Hill Bay Smoked Seafood. &quot;It's 

the right thing to do for our business and I encourage other 

suppliers to do the same.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chilean Sea Bass burst onto most menus only 10 years ago, and last 

year Bon Appetit named the Sea Bass &quot;Dish of the Year&quot;, while showing 

a photograph of and describing Chilean Sea Bass. But now, according 

to Destined for Extinction: The Fate of Chilean Sea Bass, the report 

released by the National Environmental Trust, Chilean Sea Bass 

suffers from acute over-fishing by &quot;pirate&quot; poachers in the remote 

waters near Antarctica, and is on the verge of extinction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;New York chefs have taken a cue from their colleagues in a 

national campaign to help save Chilean Sea Bass from extinction,&quot; 

said NET's Take A Pass on Chilean Sea Bass campaign manager Andrea 

Kavanagh. &quot;We've gained the support of more than 500 chefs across the 

country who want to join in the fight. With such an overwhelming 

response, we are hopeful that other local restaurants and retailers 

nationwide will quickly follow suit.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite regulations set by the Commission for the Conservation of 

Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), the international 

governmental body that regulates Chilean Sea Bass, estimates indicate 

that nearly 80 percent of Chilean Sea Bass sold on the world market 

are illegally obtained. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The non-stop pace of illegal fishing virtually guarantees that 

the entire species will collapse in less than five years unless we 

take immediate action,&quot; said Beth Clark, director of The Antarctica 

Project. &quot;Last year alone -- with regulations in place -- nearly 

40,000 tons of Chilean Sea Bass were illegally fished in the waters 

around Antarctica. If we don't allow Chilean Sea Bass to grow back to 

healthy sizes and numbers, soon there won't be any left to catch.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The practical reality is that current regulations are not enough 

to protect Chilean Sea Bass from extinction,&quot; said Kavanagh. &quot;Until 

we have a reliable system to track legal versus illegal catches of 

Chilean Sea Bass, we have to make it unprofitable for the pirates to 

continue their poaching and ask consumers to &quot;Take a Pass on Chilean 

Sea Bass.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to asking for support from chefs around the country, 

today &quot;Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass&quot; kicked off their consumer 

campaign with a one-minute flash animation video. The short animated 

clip highlights the need to protect Chilean Sea Bass and asks 

consumers to join chefs in taking the pledge to not eat, buy or serve 

Chilean Sea Bass until stronger regulations are in place and 

enforced. The flash animation and consumer pledge can be accessed
