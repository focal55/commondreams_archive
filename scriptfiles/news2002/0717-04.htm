- July 17 - The National Women's Law 
Center today announced its opposition to the confirmation of 
Justice Priscilla Owen to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit and urged the Senate to reject her nomination. Justice 
Owen, who currently serves on the Texas Supreme Court, has a 
troubling record on issues of concern to women, particularly in the 
area of reproductive rights. Owen has demonstrated hostility toward 
reproductive rights and an unwillingness to follow the law in this 
area. In addition, Owen's record on sex discrimination and other 
legal issues of importance to women displays a staunch conservatism 
that is well outside the mainstream. The Senate Judiciary Committee 
is expected to hold a hearing on the nomination on July 23. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Justice Owen's refusal to follow the law in the context of 
reproductive rights, combined with other troubling aspects of her 
rulings, convinces us that she does not belong on the Fifth Circuit 
Court of Appeals,&quot; said Marcia D. Greenberger, NWLC co-president. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No judicial nominee enjoys a presumption in favor of 
confirmation. As numerous legal scholars have shown, it is the 
nominee who carries the burden of convincing the Senate that he or 
she should be confirmed, and any doubts should be resolved against 
confirmation. Nominees for the federal bench must satisfy the 
Senate that they meet all of the criteria for confirmation. If they 
do not, the American people should not be asked to bear the risk of 
entrusting the nominee with the reigns of judicial power. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If confirmed to the Fifth Circuit, Justice Owen would be 
entitled to lifetime tenure on the Court of Appeals. Because this 
position would afford her enormous power over issues of fundamental 
importance to all Americans, Owen and her record must be evaluated 
to determine her views on and approaches to the law. In addition to 
meeting the requirements of honesty, integrity, character, 
temperament and intellect, to be confirmed to a federal judgeship 
a nominee should be required to demonstrate a commitment to 
protecting the rights of ordinary American citizens and the 
progress that has been made on civil rights and individual 
liberties, including those core constitutional principles that 
protect women's legal rights under the Equal Protection Clause and 
the right to privacy (which includes contraception and abortion) as 
well as statutory provisions that protect women's legal rights in 
such fundamental areas as education, employment, and health and 
safety. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As an organization dedicated to advancing and protecting women's legal rights, 
the Center has focused its review of Justice Owen's record on the fundamental 
constitutional right to privacy, including the right to terminate a pregnancy 
and related aspects of women's reproductive rights and health. The Center also 
examined her record on protections against sex discrimination and other legal 
issues of importance to women. Owen's record raises serious questions about her 
commitment to protecting women's fundamental rights. To view NWLC's report detailing
