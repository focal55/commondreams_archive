- April 29 - News Advisory:

<p>Two new surveys to be released tomorrow suggest that some

low-income teen parents are not receiving Temporary Assistance for

Needy Families (TANF) benefits and other public assistance for

which they appear eligible. As Congress considers the

reauthorization of TANF, too little attention has been paid to the

needs of low-income teen parents, a particularly vulnerable

population about which we don't know enough. In fact, federal and

state data collection about teen parents and TANF remains

inadequate, according to one of the surveys.

<p>The reports will be released at two briefings, which are open to

the press:

<p>9-10 a.m., Capitol Building, Room SC-6

2-3 p.m., Capitol Building, Room HC-9

<p>During welfare reform in 1996, policymakers recognized that

concentrating on teen parents was critically important: although

teen parents represent only about five percent of the overall TANF

caseload, historically about 50 percent of adult welfare recipients

began parenting as teens. The 1996 law created special rules for

teen parents, generally requiring them to live at home or in

supervised settings and to stay in school/training in order to

receive benefits. However, the new surveys suggest that these

rules are having the unintended consequence of turning away needy

teens who are not in school or not living at home, rather than

giving them the opportunity to come into compliance.

<p>Two reports are being released:

<p>-- <i>Knocking on the Door: Barriers to Welfare and Other

Assistance for Teen Parents</i> by Deborah L. Shapiro and Helene M.

Marcy, the Center for Impact Research, Chicago -- A survey of

low-income teen mothers in Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago.

<p>-- <i>Add It Up: Teen Parents and Welfare...Undercounted,

Oversanctioned, Underserved</i> by Janellen Duffy and Jodie

Levin-Epstein, the Center for Law and Social Policy -- A survey of

state administrators in 33 states, including data on teen mothers

from 11 states.

<p>For information about these events or to receive embargoed

copies of the reports, contact John Hutchins, Communications

Director, CLASP, 202-906-8013, jhutchins@clasp.org.
