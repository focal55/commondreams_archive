- May 8 - Business leaders will speak 

to Congressional aides and policy advocates this morning on Capitol 

Hill regarding the challenges and opportunities facing those 

businesses that seek to address climate change. The speakers will 

emphasize the importance of taking action on climate change to 

ensure the long-term health of the economy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The business leaders will examine why it is vital for the 

federal government to send clear climate change policy signals. 

They will also explain how the lack of a definitive federal climate 

policy makes it difficult for businesses to plan for the future or 

accurately assess the risks climate change pose to companies and 

their investors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The briefing, Climate Change Policy and Business Opportunities, 

is co-sponsored by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) and Redefining 

Progress. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The federal government has the opportunity to transform energy 

usage by businesses of all sizes, by creating policies which spur 

innovation in the private sector. Policies that reward carbon 

reductions will create an environment for entrepreneurial 

innovation and a new market of products that reduce emissions,&quot; 

said Robert Epstein, co-founder of Environmental Entrepreneurs and 

a co-founder of Sybase. &quot;They would also accelerate existing trends 

toward adopting energy efficient and alternative energy 

technologies.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;A market-based climate strategy would provide growth 

opportunities for some companies, be neutral for many, and generate 

revenue that could aid the industries, workers, and publics most 

affected by the transition,&quot; said Michel Gelobter, Redefining 

Progress' executive director. &quot;Despite the claims of alarmists, 

policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will create a different 

economy, not a worse economy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other speakers who will participate in the briefing today 

include: Frank Dixon, Managing Director, Innovest Strategic Value 

Advisors; Daniel Lashof, Science Director, Climate Center, Natural 

Resources Defense Council; Frank Mazanec, Senior Vice President, 

OnSight Energy; Diana Propper, Co-Founder and Managing Director, EA 

Capital; and Alexandra Deane Thornton, Executive Director, Center 

for a Sustainable Economy. </font></p>
