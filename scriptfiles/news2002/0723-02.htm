- July 23 - America's National Forests suffer from serious disrepair after decades 

of destructive logging, but a new report says solutions exist to bring silt-clogged 

trout streams back to life, stabilize landslide-prone hillsides, and create good 

jobs in forest communities. The report, released today by the Sierra Club, highlights 

the benefits, as well as the challenges, of restoring our nation's treasured forests. 

With the recent forest fires focusing Americans' attention on the need for sensible 

forest management, the report posits restoration as a key element in the long-term 

goal of protecting forests and communities.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;With forest restoration we can embark on the path to the future. Restoring 

our National Forests will leave a legacy of clean air and water, wildlife habitat, 

recreation opportunities, and protection from flooding and catastrophic fires 

-- a wild heritage that is worth more than can be measured in two-by-fours,&quot; 

the report reads.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This report will help Americans understand the importance of restoring 

our nation's forests, to protect communities and wildlife and to restore what's 

left of our wild forest heritage,&quot; said Sean Cosgrove, Sierra Club forest 

policy specialist. &quot;Instead of wasting taxpayer money on commercial logging 

of these forests, we should be restoring what remains of America's playgrounds.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, &quot;Restoring America's Forests: Protecting Habitat, Saving Stream 

and Generating Jobs in our National Forests,&quot; is an in-depth look at the 

methods, costs, benefits, and politics of forest restoration projects. The report 

includes case studies from Redwood National Forest in California, the White River 

in Vermont, the Umpqua National Forest in Oregon and others.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Americans love these special places for the wonderful services they provide 

-- clean drinking water, recreational and economic opportunities, and fish and 

wildlife habitat,&quot; said Cosgrove. &quot;It is imperative that we restore 

the health and wealth of goods and services our forests provide, for our families, 

for our future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report is designed to help policy makers, community leaders, land managers, 

and the public identify the opportunities, challenges and benefits of restoring 

our nation's forests. While many restoration projects actively engage the local 

communities in the health of their forests, some forest management officials undermine 

this trust by promoting intensive logging under the guise of restoration.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This summer's fire season has confirmed the need to rethink our forest 

management strategies and proactively restore our National Forests,&quot; continued 

Cosgrove. &quot;If done correctly, forest restoration can be at the heart of a 

new way of thinking for government agencies in charge of managing our nation's 

federal forests, like the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.&quot;</font></p>
