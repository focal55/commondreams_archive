- May 21 - The Sierra Club today expressed disappointment that the US Senate rejected a measure aimed at ensuring that trade agreements uphold environmental and health protections.  But despite the narrow defeat, environmentalists were heartened by the Senate's full and vigorous debate, which indicated serious concerns among lawmakers about any approach to international trade that does not consider the potential impact on the environment.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By a slim margin, Senators turned down an amendment sponsored by Senator John Kerry (D-MA).  The measure would have prevented expansion of dangerous NAFTA provisions that put our hard-won environmental and public health laws at the mercy of foreign corporations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's close vote shows that many lawmakers are starting to think twice about allowing new trade deals that could threaten clean air and clean water,&quot; said Carl Pope, Sierra Club Executive Director.  &quot;The Senate is waking up to the fact that sweeping global trade deals can have wide-ranging impacts for the environment and public health.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate is considering &quot;fast track&quot; legislation, which denies Congress the right to strike anti-environmental provisions from trade agreements. The White House intends to use fast track to expand NAFTA provisions that allow foreign investors to sue governments whenever they feel that environmental laws have affected their profits.  Senator Kerry's amendment would have protected our environmental laws by denying foreign investors such broad rights to sue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate failed to fix fast track's worst threats to the environment. When it comes to a final vote in the House, lawmakers must now reject this legislation,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;International trade can and should be a force for progress.  It should not come before protecting our environment and public health.&quot;</font></p>
