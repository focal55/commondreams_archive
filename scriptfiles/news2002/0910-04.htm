- September 10 - One year after September 11th, lobbying organizations for the 

chemical and oil industries are trying to stop legislation to address chemical 

plant security from becoming law.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. Senate is considering taking 

up the Chemical Security Act as an amendment to the homeland security bill. The 

bill was voted for by nine Republicans, nine Democrats, and one independent when 

the Senate's Committee on the Environment and Public Works passed the bill on 

July 25.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Despite broad bipartisan support 

for legislation to address what is universally viewed as a major security threat, 

the chemical industry is apparently still trying to kill common-sense security 

legislation,&quot; said Meghan Purvis, toxics and environmental health associate 

with U.S. PIRG, a public interest advocacy organization. &quot;This common-sense 

chemical security legislation should be part of the Homeland Security plan. We 

hope the Senate makes public safety its priority.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Across the United States, thousands 

of industrial facilities use and store hazardous chemicals in quantities that 

could threaten communities if deliberately attacked by terrorists. According to 

the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 123 facilities have at least 1 million 

people living close enough to be at risk of injury or death in the event of a 

chemical release. The Army Surgeon General ranked the threat of an attack on an 

industrial chemical facility second only to bioterrorism in the number of Americans 

who could be affected. Congress passed a bioterrorism bill earlier this year.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Chemical Security Act, S. 1602, 

introduced by Senator Corzine (D-NJ), would require high-priority facilities to 

conduct vulnerability and hazard assessments, and develop plans for improving 

site security and reducing chemical hazards. The legislation passed unanimously 

out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in July and will be offered 

by Senator Corzine as an amendment to the homeland security bill being debated 

by the Senate.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Despite the broad support 

demonstrated in the Senate so far, industry lobbying organizations are working 

aggressively to attempt to kill the bill. On August 29th, 30 trade associations 

faxed a letter to the US Senate asking members to oppose S. 1602 or a version 

of it if attached to the Homeland Security Act. Supporters of the bill immediately 

responded that most of the arguments raised by industry lobbyists were either 

inaccurate or misleading.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, the lobbying organizations' 

letter claimed that S. 1602 would create a &quot;clearinghouse&quot; of facilities' 

security information that could &quot;potentially be used by terrorists,&quot; 

even though the bill withholds facilities' security assessments and plans from 

public view and creates strict information-handling requirements. The industry 

letter also claimed that the bill would &quot;disrupt ongoing security enhancements 

and federal partnerships,&quot; even though the bill's authors addressed this 

concern by including an early compliance provision, which allows a company to 

have its ongoing security programs reviewed for compliance with the bill even 

before federal agencies issue regulations to implement the law.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Industry groups are also trying to 

create an image of grassroots opposition to the bill. In late August, the American 

Chemistry Council issued a request for &quot;immediate action,&quot; calling on 

plant managers and workers in Ohio to call Senators and oppose the Chemical Security 

Act. However, the United Steelworkers of America, the union representing the largest 

number of chemical workers in the U.S., supports the bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the year 2000, the total lobbying 

expenditures of the lobbying organizations opposing the chemical security bill 

amounted to $34,653,779. Supporters of the Chemical Security Act include the United 

Steelworkers, environmental and public interest organizations, the American Public 

Health Association, and Physicians for Social Responsibility. </font></p>
