- July 31 - An international coalition of public health professionals and activists 

organized by Commercial Alert today requested that UNICEF stop &quot;lending its 

good name and endorsement to McDonald's&quot; and cancel &quot;McDonald's World 

Children's Day.&quot; The coalition sent the request in a letter to UNICEF Executive 

Director Carol Bellamy.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On July 19, Ms. Bellamy and McDonald's Corp. CEO Jack Greenberg announced that 

they will &quot;team up&quot; to raise funds for children's charities, including 

UNICEF, and launch &quot;McDonald's World Children's Day.&quot; The event is scheduled 

for November 20th, which is the anniversary of the United Nations adoption of 

the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Last year, Ronald McDonald House Charities 

gave $5 million to UNICEF. The letter follows.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Ms. Bellamy:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On July 19, UNICEF announced its partnership with the McDonald's Corporation 

to hold &quot;McDonald's World Children's Day.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In effect, UNICEF is lending its good name and endorsement to McDonald's, the 

world's largest fast food chain. McDonald's is a global leader in the marketing 

of junk food that is creating soaring rates of childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes, 

and that is disrupting traditional ways of food preparation in families and cultures. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is truly a challenge to see how this partnership with McDonald's is consistent 

with UNICEF's claim to promote &quot;good nutrition&quot; to the world's children. 

As you know, McDonald's markets precisely the high-added-fat, high-added-sugar 

junk food that undermines good nutrition for the world's children.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McDonald's is responsible for multi-million dollar ad campaigns that prod children 

to nag, whine and throw tantrums so that their parents will consent to buy them 

junk food. The company's ad campaigns deliberately foment conflict between parents 

and children regarding food.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not the proper role of UNICEF to endorse or serve as enabler for corporate 

activities of this kind. Do you really think people contribute to UNICEF so that 

you can help corporate advertisers to manipulate innocent and impressionable children 

with sophisticated psychological techniques, cause strife in the home and promote 

the consumption of junk food?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNICEF's mission is to protect children from just these things. Therefore, 

we urge you to reconsider your partnership with the McDonald's Corporation, and 

cancel &quot;McDonald's World Children's Day&quot; immediately.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Below is the UNICEF/McDonalds news release:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">http://www.unicef.org/newsline/02pr45McD.htm</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNICEF, McDONALD'S &reg; and Ronald McDonald House Charities &reg; team up 

to raise funds for children </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McDonald's Announces &quot;World Children's Day&quot; for November 20 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK (July 19, 2002) - UNICEF and McDonald's today announced plans to team 

up to raise money on behalf of the world's children as part of a new McDonald's 

fundraising initiative called &quot;World Children's Day,&quot; which will benefit 

Ronald McDonald House Charities&acirc; (RMHC) worldwide and UNICEF programs in 

about a dozen countries. The initiative was announced by Jack Greenberg, McDonald's 

Chairman and CEO, and Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McDonald's World Children's Day is a major fundraising initiative that will 

be inaugurated on November 20, 2002. On that day, McDonald's restaurants in 121 

countries will raise money for local children's organizations through a variety 

of activities and promotions developed by each restaurant. UNICEF will be a beneficiary 

of the World Children's Day effort in select countries, including the United States, 

where McDonald's will support UNICEF's renowned &quot;Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF&quot; 

program. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The November 20th date coincides with the anniversary of the United Nations 

adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which took place on November 

20, 1989.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The value of this program for UNICEF and Ronald McDonald House Charities 

goes far beyond the millions of dollars that will be raised for children,&quot; 

said Mr. Greenberg, who met today with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan 

to discuss the McDonald's fundraising initiative. &quot;It brings the world's 

attention to the ever increasing needs of children, and the role we must all play 

in affecting positive change to improve the lives of children everywhere.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are very pleased that McDonald's is expanding its support for children 

around the world,&quot; Ms. Bellamy said. &quot;The opportunity to distribute 

the orange Trick-or-Treat boxes through McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. will 

help us reach a whole new generation of children whose parents supported UNICEF 

when they were kids,&quot; she said. Bellamy also noted that last year RMHC awarded 

a $5 million grant to UNICEF to combat Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus in 57 priority 

countries. &quot;We appreciate the continued support of McDonald's and RMHC,&quot; 

she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the United Nations Special Session on Children in May 2002, the Secretary-General 

called on the private sector to become more involved in United Nations efforts 

to promote and sustain child survival and child rights. The McDonald's World Children's 

Day initiative represents a response to this call.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Whatever our role in life, there is nothing that unites us and motivates 

us more than the welfare of children,&quot; Mr. Annan said. &quot;Children are 

our future. It is only by investing in them and their well-being that we can hope 

to build the healthy, prosperous and peaceful world we all strive for...Public-private 

partnerships have the power to help children in many ways.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNICEF offices will work directly with McDonald's restaurants in participating 

countries to raise funds and awareness for children's causes. Examples:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* This October McDonald's restaurants in the United States will distribute 

20 million of the traditional orange &quot;Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF&quot; collection 

boxes - more than doubling the reach of the program.<br>

<br>

* In New Zealand, UNICEF and RMHC are teaming up on a new ad campaign in support 

of World Children's Day. Young people selected through a program in McDonald's 

restaurants will speak out on what they see as the most important children's issues 

today. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* McDonald's China is implementing a four-week program with UNICEF culminating 

in the country's first-ever on-line concert available exclusively to those participating 

in the World Children's Day fundraising effort. With the purchase of a Big Mac 

on November 20, customers will receive access to the internet concert, and a portion 

of sales will be donated to UNICEF. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*UNICEF and McDonald's restaurants in Hong Kong are initiating &quot;Love for 

Our Future with UNICEF,&quot; a program designed to symbolize caring for the next 

generation. Specially designed postcards which children can personalize with their 

own messages will be available for sale at McDonald's restaurants, with proceeds 

going to the charities. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McDonald's is the world's leading foodservice retailer, with more than 30,000 

restaurants serving over 46 million people each day in 121 countries. Approximately 

80 percent of McDonald's U.S. restaurants are owned and operated by independent 

local businessmen and women. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ronald McDonald House Charities, a non-profit, 501(c)3, creates, finds and 

supports programs that directly improve the health and well being of children 

through its network of 171 local Chapters currently serving in 44 countries. To 

date, RMHC has awarded more than $320 million in grants to aid critical children's 

causes in such areas as immunization, education, life-changing surgeries, child 

abuse prevention and aid for the mentally and physically challenged. RMHC also 

supports Ronald McDonald Houses, Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles and other community 

efforts for children.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UNICEF works to save children's lives and build children's futures by immunizing 

children against deadly diseases; fighting HIV/AIDS and its impact on young people; 

promoting quality basic education for girls and boys everywhere; protecting all 

children from violence, abuse, and exploitation; and supporting early childhood 

programs that bring better health, good nutrition, and clean water to children 

in the crucial first years of life. Founded in 1946, UNICEF now works in 161 countries 

and territories.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:<br>

Please ask UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy to <br>

(1) cancel &quot;McDonald's World Children's Day&quot; and <br>

(2) not to partner with McDonald's. </font></p>
