- May 14 - Legislation to renew the 

President's authority to negotiate new trade agreements could set 

the stage for unprecedented legal protections for foreign investors 

against local, state and federal laws. If not fixed, the 

legislation could cost taxpayers $32 billion in monetary damages 

and threaten many of our public health and safety laws, according 

to a new study released today by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a 

national budget watchdog organization. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The current legislation provides foreign corporations more 

legal rights than provided to Americans,&quot; said Joe Theissen, 

Executive Director at Taxpayers for Common Sense. &quot;The prospect of 

imposing this new fiscal burden on U.S. taxpayers should be cause 

for grave concern during this period of national emergency and 

serious budget shortfalls. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to The Fiscal Impacts of Investment Provisions in 

United States Trade Agreements, a study released today by Taxpayers 

for Common Sense, and written by two professors from Tufts 

University, the &quot;investor protection&quot; provision could expose U.S. 

taxpayers to claims totaling up to $32 billion annually. &quot;If not 

fixed, future trade agreements could subject the United States to 

massive financial liabilities,&quot; continued Theissen. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under current trade law, foreign investors operating in the 

United States are allowed to bring lawsuits to overturn federal and 

state laws that they deem to be unfair and costly to their 

business. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 

foreign interests have brought a number of suits seeking billions 

of dollars in damages from the federal government. The provisions 

in the trade agreement only apply to foreign investors, and grant 

no new legal rights to U.S. citizens. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A number of public officials, policy-makers, and members of the 

public have raised strong concerns about the investor protection 

provisions in future trade agreements. The National Conference of 

State Legislators, the National Association of Attorneys General, 

the National League of Cities, and the National Association of 

Counties have all urged the Senate to put measures in the 

fast-track bill that will require the investment provisions of all 

future trade deals to be consistent with U.S. law. Sen. John 

Kerry (D-Mass.) is expected is offer an amendment later this week on 

the investor-related provision. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many point to the pending lawsuit for $1 billion filed by the 

Canadian Methanex Corporation as a clear-cut case of why the 

investor-protection provisions needs to be fixed. Methanex is 

suing under NAFTA on grounds that a California public health law 

that bans the use of MTBE, a gasoline additive found to contaminate 

drinking water, will cut into Methanex's future profits. There has 

already been more than $3 billion in lawsuits filed under the NAFTA 

investor-protection provisions. Other examples of cases include: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A company called Group ADF filed a $90 million lawsuit under &quot;Buy America&quot; rules. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Kenex, Ltd. filed a $20 million lawsuit against the U.S. 

government on its discriminatory policies against industrial hemp 

products. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- A funeral home company, called the Loewen Group filed a $725 

million lawsuit saying that the state of Mississippi discriminated 

against them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Subjecting the United States to liability claims brought by 

investors from any nation will have a chilling effect on the 

enforcing our nation's laws,&quot; concluded Theissen. </font></p>
