- May 15 - After years of tension between the disability rights

community and the nation's unions, ADAPT scored a historic meeting with top

union officials to begin working together to support people in the community

while also assuring their attendants a living wage. And it all happened in

the blink of an eye after ADAPT blocked access to the headquarters of three

of the nation's largest unions, including the American Federation of Labor

and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AFL-CIO offices were hit simultaneously with those of the American Federation

of State, County and Municipal employees (AFSCME) and the Service Employees

International Union (SEIU). In a matter of minutes, top officials at all

sites began negotiating with ADAPT, and quickly agreed to providing written

commitment for meetings within 60 days. Gerald W. McEntee, President of

AFSCME, and who also serves on the Executive Council of the AFL-CIO,

committed to personally arrange a meeting before July 14 with ADAPT

representatives, himself, John J. Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, and

Andrew Stern, International President of the SEIU.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ADAPT shares the unions' goal of a living wage for the workers who assist

us,&quot; said Bob Kafka, National ADAPT Organizer from Texas. &quot;That only

increases the chances we will get better care from more qualified assistants,

who will remain in their jobs over time. What we will not accept, though, is

holding people with disabilities hostage in nursing homes and institutions to

protect jobs for unionized employees. ADAPT's strong message to union

officials has been heard, and now we can work on solutions to our mutual

problems.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a written letter of commitment from the AFL-CIO, William Samuel, Director

of Legislation, wrote that, &quot;The AFL-CIO supports the effort to move care for

people with disabilities into the communities where they live and work.

Allowing then to retain their independence, while getting care and services

in the most appropriate setting.&quot; He concluded the letter with, &quot;Please be

assured that we will work with the bill sponsors, Senator Harkin and

Representative Davis, and the disability community to pass a bill that

recognizes the needs and dignity of both people with disabilities and the

workers who care for them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; We really did make history today,&quot;said Linda Anthony, ADAPT Organizer from

Pennsylvania. The unions of America are so powerful, and in the past they

have been a significant part of the problem, not wanting institutions to

close because their members faced job loss. At the AFL-CIO we talked to the

Civil Rights Director and his assistant, and they immediately got the civil

rights implications of that former position. Given that the unions are the

experts on organizing, it felt really good on our way out when they told us

that our action and strategies against them were the best organizing they had

ever seen!&quot;</font></p>
