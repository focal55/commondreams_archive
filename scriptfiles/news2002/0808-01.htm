- August 8 - Citizen groups delivered a letter today to Johannesburg Mayor Amos 

Masondo, condemning the treatment and arrest of activists who protested their 

lack of rights to basic water and electricity in South Africa and are facing trial 

this month. The letter asks for charges to be dropped and demands the immediate 

implementation of free water and electricity for all impoverished people, as was 

internationally advertised by the South African ruling party, the African National 

Congress (ANC), two years ago.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Controversy over the arrests comes as delegates from more than 100 nations 

prepare to meet in Johannesburg later this month for the World Summit for Sustainable 

Development (WSSD), a United Nations-sponsored forum. The summit, which is being 

held 10 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, will address major environmental 

challenges that affect the planet on a global scale, including water, energy, 

agriculture, biodiversity and trade/globalization. It will be held from Aug. 26 

to Sept. 4.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Summit unfolds to a global audience, however, the local trial will depict 

exactly the type of treatment that many of the world&#8217;s poor are now enduring. 

Due to increasing privatization measures by the government, many people cannot 

afford the rising costs of water. As death and illness rise among the poor, many 

South Africans are expressing their anger in the form of public protests.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This trial gives the wrong message on the eve of the World Summit,&quot; 

said Wenonah Hauter, director of Public Citizen&#8217;s Critical Mass Energy and 

Environment Program. &quot;The world&#8217;s leaders need to stop trying to profit 

from a precious natural resource and start designating water as a basic, human 

right.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter to Masondo was signed by Public Citizen, Global Exchange, Center 

for Economic Justice, Municipal Services Project, Polaris Institute and the Council 

of Canadians.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With a 50 percent increase in pricing of water and electricity in the past 

two years in some areas, many South African families are unable to pay charges 

that often require half the average household income. In parts of South Africa, 

poor households pay 10-15 times the price paid by wealthy households, and often 

for an inferior service.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trial, to be held on Aug. 15, focuses on the April protest, during which 

activists from the Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee gathered in front of the 

mayor&#8217;s house to protest the cut-off of their services, the tariff increases 

and the inability to address their grievances in relation to water and electricity. 

When several people tried to cut off the mayor&#8217;s utilities, one of the mayor&#8217;s 

bodyguards fired eight shots into the crowd, wounding two people. Subsequently, 

87 members of the Soweto Crisis Committee were arrested for public violence, including 

many elderly and several children.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;After the arrests, it took the courts 11 days to hear the charges &#8211; 

11 days these people spent in a notorious jail,&quot; said Hauter, referring to 

the infamous Diepkloof prison. &quot;These people were simply protesting their 

inability to access a basic human right. What do you expect to happen when water 

is treated as a commodity instead of a public trust?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">International protests against the trial are being planned at South African 

embassies around the world on Aug. 15. On Aug. 31, tens of thousands of activists 

plan to march in Johannesburg during the WSSD to oppose privatization of their 

water and electricity services.</font></p>
