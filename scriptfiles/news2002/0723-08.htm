- July 23 - Delegates from international unions, local unions, and community groups 

across the nation will convene July 25-28 in Washington, D.C., for the Labor Party's 

2nd Constitutional Convention and Educational Conference. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Once again, union members and others are meeting to express their distress 

because the voice of working Americans is not being heard," said Tony Mazzocchi, 

Labor Party National Organizer. "Nothing has changed since 1996 when the Labor 

Party was founded. Examples of corporate greed and crime abound, and more people 

than ever are experiencing income and job insecurity. For most, housing, health 

care, prescription drugs, and education have become less affordable and less available." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Build the Future: Labor Party Convention and Conference kicks off on Thursday 

July 25 at 6:30 pm at the Capital Hilton Hotel in Washington. A one-day educational 

conference will be held Friday, July 26, featuring speakers Leo Gerard, president, 

United Steel Workers of America, and Jim Hightower, "America's Number One Populist." 

In addition, labor leaders, activists and policy experts will lead panels on Labor 

Party campaigns for Just Health Care, Free Higher Education, Workplace Rights 

and Fair Trade. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"One of the goals of the Labor Party has always been to challenge people to 

think differently about solutions to the countless issues that affect our lives," 

Mazzocchi noted. "We see this convention and conference as an opportunity to learn, 

plan and get organized for the future." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Saturday, July 27, the Second Constitutional Convention convenes with discussion 

and debate of resolutions and constitutional amendments submitted by Labor Party 

members and affiliate unions. Ken Riley, one of the leaders in the Charleston 

Five struggle, will receive the Labor Party's Karen Silkwood award. Striking and 

locked-out workers will share their struggles during Solidarity Hour. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Labor Party was founded in 1996 and held its First Constitutional Convention 

in 1998. It includes members of every union in the United States as well as many 

local community activists. Endorsing International Unions include the United Mine 

Workers of America; American Federation of Government Employees; United Electrical, 

Radio and Machine Workers of America; California Nurses Association; Brotherhood 

of Maintenance of Way Employees; Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy 

Workers and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee. </font>
