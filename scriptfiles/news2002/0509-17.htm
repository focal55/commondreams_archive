At Dow Annual Meeting Infact Challenges Chemical Giant

to Earn its Removal from Hall of Shame</font></div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIDLAND, MI - May 9 -   As Dow Chemical shareholders, employees and executives gather for its annual meeting, the national corporate accountability organization Infact is urging the corporation to reduce its influence over public policy. Infact inducted Dow into its Hall of Shame in 1996, challenging the chemical giant to stop interfering in public policy at the expense of health and the environment. Since that time, Dow has engaged in dialogue with Infact to address the influence-peddling abuses highlighted by the Hall of Shame, but has also increased its federal lobbying force.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Speaking before hundreds of shareholders to Dow&#146;s top leadership, Infact Executive Director Kathryn Mulvey said, &#147;Today&#146;s public and political climate demands new leadership from the business community in the areas of ethics and accountability. The Enron scandal has shone a bright spotlight on the need for real checks and balances over corporate behavior. We understand that Dow is in the process of revising its Code of Business Conduct. While stronger policies are a step in the right direction, tangible implementing actions are required to make those policies an operational reality.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Infact&#146;s Hall of Shame challenges the gross imbalance in political influence between large corporations and ordinary people-an imbalance made evident by thousands of pages of Department of Energy documents released earlier this year. The documents revealed that the White House&#146;s 2001 national energy report and an executive order signed by President Bush practically mirrored proposals made by groups such as the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association that represents the largest oil companies in the US. The unaccountable power of trade and business associations and Dow&#146;s involvement in dozens of such associations led Infact to push the chemical giant for full disclosure of its memberships and criteria for membership. Infact also raised questions about the number of lobbyists working on Dow&#146;s behalf at the federal and state levels.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The passage of campaign finance reform legislation earlier this year demonstrates that people are serious about leveling the political playing field. With heightened scrutiny on the political activities and influence of large corporations, the time is ripe for public and corporate policies that will both correct past abuses and prevent future harms. Dow faces a particular challenge-and opportunity-related to its acquisition of Union Carbide, which brought with it the liabilities of the Bhopal disaster,&#148; said Mulvey. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Since 1977, Infact has been exposing life-threatening abuses of transnational corporations and organizing successful grassroots campaigns to hold corporations accountable to consumers and society at large. From the Nestl&eacute; Boycott of the 1970s and &#145;80s to the GE Boycott of the 1980s and &#145;90s to today&#146;s Boycott of Philip Morris&#146;s Kraft Foods, Infact organizes to win! Infact&#146;s Hall of Shame challenges Philip Morris, Dow Chemical, and Waste Management to stop interfering in public policy at the expense of health and the environment.
