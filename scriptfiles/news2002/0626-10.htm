<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 26 - Ralph 
Nader, Commercial Alert, and 27 authors and scholars sent a letter today to Borders 
Group CEO Gregory P. Josefowicz, asking him to reconsider his &quot;category management&quot; 
plan which will likely reduce the range of ideas in print and put small publishers 
out of business. The letter follows.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Mr. Josefowicz:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a difference between 
books and pop-tarts. It should not be necessary to point this out to a man who 
sells books, but apparently it is. According to press reports, you plan to embrace 
the grocery industry's practice of &quot;category management,&quot; so that publishers 
-- not you the bookseller but publishers -- will manage the offerings on your 
shelves.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We urge you to reconsider. 
Borders is not Albertson's. Such pop-tart marketing likely will slash the range 
of book titles and ideas available to the public. It will jeopardize smaller presses; 
and worst of all, it will further strengthen the hand of publishing conglomerates 
that have too much power already.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the May 20, 
2002 Wall Street Journal, you have devised 250 categories for books, each to be 
captained by a publishing firm. These firms will pay you a large annual fee -- 
in excess of $110,000 according to the Journal -- which will be hard for most 
small and medium-sized publishers to muster. In return, the &quot;captains&quot; 
will be able to decide which books you carry, how many are bought, and where they 
are placed. Although you say you will keep final authority over book-buying, Borders 
will be an agent of the publishers rather than of its customers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under your plans, smaller 
publishers will be at a big disadvantage, since each publisher-captain will be 
able to deploy your shelf space to its own advantage. In categories rich in small 
press titles, the publisher-captain will be able to cut the number of titles in 
the category, and fill the category with its own titles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Denied shelf space in a 
major outlet like Borders, smaller publishing houses will be hard pressed to survive. 
The Kremlin would have found it difficult to invent a more subtle and effective 
way of suppressing original viewpoints and ideas.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Books are not just another 
consumer product. They form much of our society's repository of ideas; they are 
the bloodstream for the life of the mind. You have a responsibility to serve as 
well as to gain, for your books have the protection of the First Amendment. If 
you were not ready to accept this responsibility, then we cannot imagine why you 
would have entered the book business to begin with. There are many other things 
to sell.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We wonder, how do you understand 
your role in regards to your readers, and those of future generations? In your 
view, how many titles are &quot;too many titles&quot; to lose? By what measure 
will you decide whether your plans have cost the public too much in terms of access 
to ideas? What steps will you take to ensure that diverse choices are lost because 
of your &quot;category management&quot; plans?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Borders Group is the 
nation's second largest book retailer. It has more than 1,190 bookstores in all 
50 states, which operate under both the Borders and Wadenbooks names. You are 
in a unique position to maintain a high standard for book sellers throughout the 
country.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once large outlets replace 
a sense of exploration by patrons with formulaic categories, the location takes 
on a distaste, a sense of being manipulated and homogenized by absentee category 
marketers instead of being served by a bookstore in a community.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please leave &quot;category 
management&quot; to the soap merchants. You have undertaken a higher calling, 
one to which we hope that you are equal.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,</font></p>
