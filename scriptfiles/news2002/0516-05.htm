<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO - May 16 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>WHAT:</b> Release of Failing to Make Ends Meet: A Report on the Economic Status of Women in California, a project spearheaded by The Women's Foundation in cooperation with the California Budget Project, California Women's Law Center, National Economic Development and Law Center, State of California Commission on the Status of Women, Women of Color Resource Center, and the Women's Leadership Alliance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By highlighting the specific economic issues facing women in California, the Report provides a framework for analyzing the impact of Governor Davis's 2002-03 Budget. Although the budget does provide a $20M partial restoration for the California Community College CalWORKs program, increase funding for food assistance for legal immigrants, and sustain funding for some childcare programs, it also includes substantial cuts to vital health and human services programs as well as programs designed to provide housing assistance to those in greatest need (emergency and farmworker housing).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Report -- the first to examine the critical factors currently affecting the economic security of women in California -- illustrates why the Governor's budget and the California economy will make it increasingly difficult for low-income women to make ends meet. The Report also provides policy recommendations in the areas of Education and Training, Employment and Wages, Making Ends Meet (hunger, childcare, housing, working poor), Women and Welfare, and Ensuring the Economic Security of Older Women.</font></p>

Fred Keeley, California State Assembly; Patti Chang, President and CEO, The Women's Foundation; Elmy Bermejo, Chair, California Commission on the Status of Women; Mary Rosas, Community Relations, Kaiser Permanente; and Diana Spatz, Founding Executive Director, Low Income Families' Empowerment through Education (LIFETIME).</font></p>
