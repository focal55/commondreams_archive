- May 8 - "Follow 

              the money and you will find what we truly care about and stand for 

              as a nation," said Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president 

              of the Children's Defense Fund. "Budgets represent moral and social 

              choices&#151;not just economic ones. It is time to make better choices 

              to protect our children."</font>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

              a new report, <i><a href="http://www.childrensdefense.org/pdf/minigreenbook.pdf" target="_new">The 

              State of Children in America's Union: A 2002 Action Guide to Leave 

              No Child Behind</a>® </i>(PDF: 2268K)<i>,</i> 

              the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) assesses the state of children 

              in our nation; how well the Bush administration has kept its promises 

              to Leave No Child Behind®&#151;CDF's trademarked mission 

              statement; and calls on the President and Congress to increase funding 

              for quality child care to help more families work and 2 million 

              more children get ready for school. </font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"CDF's 

              proposed $20 billion child care funding increase is a step towards 

              providing child care for all eligible children at a time when the 

              federal Child Care and Development Block Grant, which Congress must 

              reauthorize this year along with the 1996 welfare law, is reaching 

              only one in seven eligible children," CDF President Marian Wright 

              Edelman said. </font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 

              administration's welfare proposals require poor mothers to work 

              more hours but provide not a single new penny for child care over 

              the next five years. Rather than freezing child care and after-school 

              funding and the number of children in Head Start as the Bush administration 

              budget proposes, the nation should demand that Congress and the 

              administration freeze and repeal the tax breaks for the wealthiest 

              one percent of Americans instead," Mrs. Edelman stated.</font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              CDF report follows the money and finds the administration's budget 

              deeds do not match its promises to Leave No Child Behind&reg;. </font></p>

<ul>

              

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The administration 

                hails Head Start as the nation's "premier early childhood education 

                program." Its 2002 budget would have cut children from Head Start 

                and its 2003 budget will not give even one more child a Head Start. 

                <br>

                <br>

                </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> "The biggest 

                percentage of our budget should go to our children's education. 

                Education is my top priority," President Bush said in February 

                2001. His 2002 budget then proposed 40 times more money for tax 

                cuts than for education, according to the Center for Budget and 

                Policy Priorities.<br>

                <br>

                </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In January 

                2002, with great fanfare, the President signed his "No Child Left 

                Behind" (H.R. 1) education reform bill and "vowed to make educating 

                every child his number one domestic priority." The administration's 

                2003 budget proposed the smallest education increase in the past 

                seven years.<br>

                <br>

                </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In his inaugural 

                address, President Bush rightly declared that "deep, persistent 

                poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise." His 2002 budget 

                then proposed a $1.6 trillion tax cut that disproportionately 

                benefited the wealthy. It also proposed to double the child tax 

                credit from $500 to $1,000 but only for upper and middle income 

                families, leaving 17 million children behind, including a majority 

                of Black and Latino children. In 2003, the administration seeks 

                to accelerate and make permanent the huge tax cuts enacted by 

                Congress for the wealthiest Americans. <br>

                <br>

                </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The administration 

                says it is important for families to work and its welfare proposals 

                require more hours of work from poor parents. But its budget will 

                result in 114,000 fewer children in working families getting federal 

                child care assistance despite long child care waiting lists in 

                many states. <br>

                <br>

                </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the 2000 

                Republican National Convention, Secretary of State Colin Powell 

                eloquently stated, "We are obliged to make sure that every child 

                gets a healthy start in life. With all of our wealth and capacity, 

                we just can't stand by idly." The administration's 2002 and 2003 

                budgets leave millions of uninsured children behind including 

                immigrant children and thousands of children with disabilities 

                whose parents cannot get them needed treatment. </font></li>

</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The 

              Bush administration's budget choices favor powerful corporate interests 

              and the wealthiest taxpayers over children's urgent needs; widen 

              the gap between rich and poor&#151;already at its largest recorded 

              point in over 30 years; and repeatedly break promises and fail to 

              seize opportunities to Leave No Child Behind&reg;," said Mrs. Edelman. 

              </font></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

              report states that the money spent for the tax cut for the wealthiest 

              one percent of Americans when fully phased in could pay for almost 

              all the provisions of the comprehensive Act to Leave No Child Behind 

              (S. 940/H.R. 1990) including quality child care, Head Start, after-school 

              programs, health care, nutrition, protections against child abuse, 

              neglect and homelessness, and lift millions of children in working 

              families from poverty. Yet, in the richest and most powerful democratic 

              nation in the world: </font></p>

<ul>

              

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A child 

                is born into poverty every 43 seconds.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A child 

                is born without health insurance every minute&#151;90 percent 

                of the nine million uninsured children live in working families. 

                </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Seven million 

                children are home alone without adult supervision often after 

                school when they are at greatest risk of getting into trouble. 

                </font></li>

</ul>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"These 

              facts are not acts of God. They are our moral and political choices 

              as Americans," said Mrs. Edelman. "It is time for our great nation 

              to truly commit to Leave No Child Behind&reg; and to lead rather 

              than lag behind many other nations of the world in giving our children 

              a healthy and fair start in life." </font></p>
