- August 5 - The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) goofed when it 

chose NASCAR driver Jimmy Spencer to carry its anti-drug message to America's 

youth, since both Spencer and NASCAR have lucrative deals pushing beer. That, 

according to the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), is 

the latest in a series of missteps by so-called &quot;Drug Czar&quot; John Walters, 

whose agency has come under fire for leaving alcohol off its anti-drug agenda. 

</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As beer promoters, Jimmy Spencer and NASCAR are the wrong messengers,&quot; 

said George Hacker, director of CSPI's Alcohol Policies Project. &quot;They're 

no better than the Budweiser frogs as anti-drug spokesmen. It really shows that 

the drug czar has a blind spot when it comes to booze.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A recent ONCDP brochure touting the office's outreach to the auto racing world 

actually pictured Spencer's race car emblazoned with the familiar &quot;Bud&quot; 

logo. Spencer's web site has photos of the driver wearing a Bud hat and posing 

behind cases of Busch beer. Only a couple of mouse clicks separate Spencer's shot-glass 

sales from his anti-drug links. Other drivers, like Rusty Wallace and Sterling 

Martin, plug Miller and Coors, respectively. NASCAR has a $7.5 million sponsorship 

deal with Busch beer. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a letter today to Walters, CSPI's Hacker wrote that ONDCP's anti-drug message 

is compromised by NASCAR's beer deals, which include omnipresent beer logos even 

on kid-friendly items like caps and toy cars. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When we tried to get alcohol included in ONDCP's ad campaign, this wasn't 

exactly what we had in mind,&quot; Hacker said. </font></p>
