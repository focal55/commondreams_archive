Outreach coordinator for the Cuban Committee for Democracy (based in Miami), Arzola said today: "We need engagement with Cuba, and to shift away from the politics of

isolation towards more openness and dialogue. It's hypocritical of the U.S.

government to talk about democracy in Cuba and not other places where that

isn't as convenient."

Author of <I>Cuba and the United States: A Chronological History</I>, Franklin said today:

"The Jimmy Carter visit highlights the threat to our freedoms posed not by

Fidel Castro but by the right-wing Cuban lobby and our own government. First, a

former president of the United States has to request the [U.S.] government's

permission to travel to Cuba. Then two members of Congress -- Ileana

Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart -- demand (on March 22) that the White

House deny this permission. What these forces mean by restoring 'democracy' to

Cuba is really restoring plutocracy under U.S. domination. It's no mere

coincidence that Diaz-Balart's father was head of the Cuban Senate under the

Batista dictatorship."

Director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, Birns said today: "The Bush administration

seems intent on ratcheting up its anti-Castro campaign by launching, just as former

President Jimmy Carter was preparing to fly to Cuba, un-evidenced accusations

against Cuba to promote an atmosphere of crisis where none existed before.

Secretary of State Powell apparently has leased jurisdiction over Latin

American affairs to ideologues within his department who appear to be preparing

to announce a stepped-up anti-Havana policy on May 20. Perhaps the most

dangerous recent development facing U.S.-Cuban relations arises from the

unsubstantiated accusations and thinly-veiled threats made by John Bolton,

Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. Claiming

that the Cuban bio-terrorism threat had been 'underplayed' by previous

administrations, Bolton -- whose far-right credentials were exhibited while

serving as a senior Department of Justice official during the Reagan

administration -- tried to cast Cuba's internationally-applauded biotechnology

sector, which accounts for tens of millions of dollars in its vitally important

export income and substantially contributes to the island's high health

standards, as a front for bio-terrorism. Otto Reich, the administration's

controversial assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, now

leads a veritable cabal of highly directed and radicalized Cuban-American administration

officials intent on fomenting greater hostility between the two nations by

concocting an atmosphere of near-hysteria between the two countries."
