CA - September 16 - While the United States calls for &quot;trade not aid&quot; 

and elimination of subsidies and tariffs, the 2002 U.S. Farm Bill, with an 80 

percent boost in spending over the 1996 bill, is an example of its policy of &quot;do 

as we say, not as we do,&quot; according to a new report by Food First/Institute 

for Food and Development Policy. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, Giving Away the Farm: The 2002 Farm Bill, details the bill's impact 

on small family farmers, trade, and agricultural sustainability. With $190 billion 

in new money over the next 10 years, this bill targets two-thirds of its money 

to the largest U.S. agribusiness farms that grow export crops such as cotton, 

rice, soybeans, and wheat. Though American taxpayers foot the bill, the real cost 

will be borne by family farmers around the world.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In 2001, the White House made a solemn promise to Africa: 'a new partnership 

to alleviate poverty.' However, the new partnership has turned out to be with 

American agribusiness, whose 'poverty' is being addressed with some serious corporate 

welfare,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal, co-director of Food First and author of the 

report. &quot;The farm bill bankrolls the nation's largest farmers, helping them 

grow surplus crops to dump on the world market. The new farm bill pulls a reverse 

Robin Hood: robbing the world's poor to enrich American industrial agriculture.&quot;</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. agricultural system has been designed to give American grain-trading 

giants like Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Cargill an edge in capturing the 

domestic markets of developing countries. With help from institutions such as 

the World Trade Organization (WTO), Third World countries are forced to open their 

markets to American agricultural exports. Now with a farm bill designed to depress 

farm prices to below the cost of production, they can out-compete local farmers 

at the marketplace. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the report, this U.S. pursuit of foreign markets for its agricultural 

products, has resulted in dumping of subsidized imports on Third World countries, 

collapsing local agricultural markets and destroying the livelihoods of family 

farmers, while exacerbating hunger and food insecurity. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The world's richest countries do pay about $50 billion per year in aid 

to the world's poorest nations,&quot; said Mittal. &quot;Mark Malloch Brown, the 

head of the United Nations Development Program, points out that U.S. farm subsidies 

cost those same poor countries about $50 billion a year in lost agricultural exports. 

$50 billion in, and $50 billion out. Maybe that's what the White House means by 

'trade, not aid'.&quot; </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the farm bill is a bonanza for large producers of commodity crops in 

the United States, &quot;this new bill gives away the family farm. The federal 

crop subsidies will not go to farmers who resemble John Steinbeck's Joad family, 

but to rich recipients,&quot; said Mittal. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 2002 farm bill further subsidizes well-heeled agribusiness interests which 

ensures the continued exodus of independent family farmers from the land. In 1930, 

25 percent of the population lived on six million family farms. Today the two 

million farms that remain are home to two percent of the population, with 8 percent 

of farms accounting for 72 percent of sales.</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report calls for demolishing the hypocritical 'development agenda' myth 

of free trade, renews Via Campesina's call to get the World Trade Organization 

out of agriculture, and demands that governments uphold the rights of all people 

to food sovereignty. It insists that trade policies from Washington are based 

on sound policy and reason, not on the supposed necessity of maintaining political 

and market dominance. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To read the report, please visit:<br>
