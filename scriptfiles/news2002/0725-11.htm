<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- July 25 - The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works today took the 

government's first step since September 11th to address an Achilles' heel of our 

infrastructure - the use and storage of highly hazardous materials in thousands 

of American communities.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Approximately 15,000 industrial facilities nationwide use and store significant 

quantities of toxic or flammable chemicals like, chlorine and ammonia, that put 

large numbers of American at risk of serious injury or death in the event of a 

chemical release. One hundred twenty-three facilities in the U.S. have at least 

one million people living close enough to the plant to be harmed by a chemical 

release. Security at these facilities ranges from poor to non-existent. An investigation 

by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review disclosed that a reporter entered and walked 

through more than 60 facilities in western Pennsylvania, Chicago, Houston, and 

Baltimore unchallenged.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today a bipartisan group of Senators endorsed sensible action to remedy this 

significant threat to our security, health, and safety. We applaud Senator Jon 

Corzine (D-NJ) for his leadership in crafting the Chemical Security Act and bringing 

the committee to address the threat of chemical terrorism. We applaud Senators 

James Jeffords (I-Vt.) and Bob Smith (R-NH) for sending this bill to the full 

Senate with bi-partisan support.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite aggressive lobbying by the chemical and oil industries against mandatory 

security &amp; safety requirements, this committee has sent a strong signal to 

the Senate leadership, the House of Representatives, and the Bush administration 

that the threat of chemical terrorism must be addressed. We now look to the leadership 

of the Senate and the House of Representatives to pass this chemical security 

plan with the Homeland Security bill currently being crafted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill passed by the committee will require EPA, working with the Office 

of Homeland Security, to prioritize facilities based on the hazard they pose, 

and require facilities to assess their vulnerability to attack, analyze the hazards 

that could result, and develop a plan to reduce both. Importantly, these plans 

will be based on making facilities inherently safer - by reducing the use of hazardous 

materials or switching to safer materials and processing conditions - as well 

as on improving secondary safety equipment and increasing site security. Hundreds 

of facilities have switched to safer materials, reducing or eliminating the degree 

their chance of becoming a terrorist target by reducing or eliminating the possibility 

that a chemical release could harm nearby residents.</font></p>
