VEGAS - August 6 - Nevadans for Responsible Law Enforcement (NRLE), the group 

behind Question 9, the marijuana initiative, hailed today's endorsement of the 

ballot initiative by Nevada's largest law- enforcement organization as &quot;historic.&quot;</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Nevada Conference of Police and Sheriffs (NCOPS) endorsed Question 9, 

the marijuana initiative, because it will allow law- enforcement officers to spend 

more time going after violent criminals.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The historic endorsement of the marijuana initiative by Nevada's largest 

law-enforcement organization is good news for Nevadans because it means that we're 

one step closer to ensuring that law-enforcement officers will have more time 

to go after murderers, rapists, kidnappers and other violent criminals,&quot; 

said NRLE spokesperson Billy Rogers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NCOPS President Andy Anderson said, &quot;As a former law-enforcement officer, 

I know that a simple marijuana arrest can take me off the street for several hours 

and sometimes for over half of my shift. ... We could better spend our time responding 

to more life-threatening and serious incidents.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Rogers said opponents of Question 9 have thrown up a smokescreen of disinformation 

about the initiative. He criticized federal Drug Czar John Walters and federal 

Drug Enforcement Administration chief Asa Hutchinson for telling Nevadans how 

to vote on the initiative.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Last month federal politicians paraded through Nevada urging local law-enforcement 

officers to oppose the marijuana initiative,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;The federal 

Drug Czar and DEA chief should have been listening to Nevada's law-enforcement 

officers instead of telling Nevadans how to vote.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A poll published in Monday's Reno Gazette-Journal showed that support for 

Question 9 has risen by four percentage points since Walters and Hutchinson visited 

Nevada in July.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The NCOPS endorsement should put to rest any assertion by politicians 

and the media that law-enforcement groups oppose Question 9. We are proud to have 

the support of our law-enforcement heroes in our campaign for responsible law 

enforcement.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LAS VEGAS, NEVADA -- The Nevada Conference of Police and Sheriffs (NCOPS), 

the state's largest law-enforcement organization, endorsed Question 9, the marijuana 

initiative, today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NCOPS President Andy Anderson said last year's terrorist attacks, a rising 

violent crime rate, and slowing economy contributed to his organization's decision 

to support Question 9.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Violent crime is on the rise and terrorism remains a real threat,&quot; 

Anderson said. &quot;Our priorities have changed, and with our limited resources, 

so should our laws.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anderson, a retired Las Vegas Metro Police officer, said most people who are 

arrested solely for marijuana possession never face prosecution.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As law-enforcement officers, we are duly sworn to uphold the law, even 

by arresting people for small amounts of marijuana, knowing that most of these 

cases won't be prosecuted. Many of these people are law- abiding citizens except 

for the possession charges,&quot; Anderson said.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As a former law-enforcement officer, I know that a simple marijuana 

arrest takes me off the street for several hours and sometimes for over half of 

my shift. Since most of these cases are not being prosecuted, we could better 

spend our time responding to more life-threatening and serious incidents.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I worked a patrol car for the majority of my career, and learned that 

our primary function was to `protect and serve,' just like it said on the door 

of my cruiser. Part of being a good `cop' was being available when our citizens 

called for help.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Anderson said Question 9 has safeguards to ensure public safety and punish 

people who irresponsibly use or sell marijuana.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Law-enforcement officers support Question 9, the marijuana initiative, 

because it will put drug dealers in prison, ban smoking marijuana in public places 

and strictly prohibit children from using marijuana,&quot; Anderson said &quot;Passage 

of Question 9 will ensure that more cops are on the streets to protect our citizens 

from violent crime and the threat of terrorism.&quot;</font></p>
