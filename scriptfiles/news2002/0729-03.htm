- July 29 - The voting public overwhelmingly rejects the new, industry-friendly 

approach to air pollution control being touted by the Bush Administration, according 

to the results of a new national public opinion survey. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead, voters overwhelmingly want enforcement of clean air laws to &quot;get 

stronger,&quot; the nonprofit Clean Air Trust noted today. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush plan was very quietly introduced last Friday by Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) 

right before the House of Representatives broke for a summer vacation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If it were up to the voting public, the Bush plan would be dead on arrival,&quot; 

said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The survey of registered and likely voters, conducted for the Clean Air Trust, 

found that voters by nearly a three-to-one margin reject the notion that electric 

power companies should be able to buy &quot;pollution credits&quot; from another 

company rather than clean up their own emissions. (1) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This so-called &quot;cap and trade&quot; approach is the heart of the &quot;Clear 

Skies&quot; plan proposed by the Bush Administration. The Bush plan, favored by 

industry, would eliminate key current Clean Air Act restrictions that govern all 

power companies, and instead permit power companies voluntarily to buy and sell 

pollution credits purportedly to achieve an overall national pollution ceiling. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This national survey shows that the voting public decisively rejects 

the industry-friendly Bush plan,&quot; noted O'Donnell. He noted the public opposed 

the Bush approach by 68-22 percent margin -- even when it was described in terms 

similar to those used by Bush political appointees, asserting that &quot;cap and 

trade&quot; would &quot;lead to faster reductions in air pollution at less cost 

by relying on the efficiency of the market.&quot; (2) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell noted that the survey questions were worded carefully in order not 

to &quot;load&quot; the results. &quot;For example, we did not refer to the Bush 

plan as an `Enron-style' approach, even though it is conceptually identical to 

what Enron lobbied for,&quot; said O'Donnell. &quot;Similarly, we did not point 

out that the Bush Administration has adopted an Arthur Andersen-style method of 

accounting for the benefits of the current Clean Air Act. In effect, they have 

cooked the books to make their plan look better. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The truth is, once the voting public understands what the Bush plan is 

all about, they flatly reject it,&quot; added O'Donnell, &quot;even if we don't 

point out that it will encourage irresponsible corporate behavior.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O'Donnell noted that 53 percent of Republicans, 69 percent of Independents, 

and 70 percent of Democrats oppose this proposal. It is opposed by a majority 

of voters in every region of the country, and is opposed by every demographic 

group. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While scorning the notion of &quot;cap and trade,&quot; voters overwhelmingly 

supported tougher enforcement of clean air laws, favoring it by an overwhelming 

70-2 margin. (3) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Voters also said they would be less likely (by a 45-10 percent margin) to vote 

for a candidate who supports &quot;cap and trade.&quot; (4) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lake Snell Perry &amp; Associates conducted a national omnibus survey among 

registered voters including a series of questions on the topic of Cap and Trade 

policy on behalf of The Clean Air Trust. The survey was conducted nationwide July 

14 - 16, 2002 with 1,000 registered likely voters. The margin of error is plus/minus 

3 percent. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">------ </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) The Bush Administration has proposed letting power companies choose to either 

reduce their pollution or purchase &quot;pollution credits&quot; from another 

company. In this way, companies that do not install pollution controls could comply 

with the law by purchasing &quot;pollution credits&quot; from companies that have 

reduced pollution by more than the law requires. This proposal is called &quot;Cap 

and Trade.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do you favor or oppose this &quot;Cap and Trade&quot; proposal? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Favor/strongly.......9 <br>

Favor/somewhat.......15, 24 <br>

Unsure...............13 <br>

Oppose/somewhat......15 <br>

Oppose/strongly......48, 63 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Now I am going to read you two statements about &quot;Cap and Trade.&quot; 

Please listen closely to each one and then tell me which one comes closest to 

your own viewpoint. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(ROTATE STATEMENTS) <br>

Some people say/ Other people say that &quot;Cap and Trade&quot; is the most efficient 

way to reduce air pollution. It would lead to faster reductions in air pollution 

at less cost by relying on the efficiency of the market. Inflexible, bureaucratic 

government regulation impedes the free market, thus forcing companies out of business, 

costing jobs, and driving up the price of electricity. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other people say/Some people say that &quot;Cap and Trade&quot; allows polluters 

to continue polluting and to buy their way out of anti-pollution laws. It would 

not protect air quality at the local level. It relies on companies to report how 

much they are reducing their pollution and it has no way of proving that the reports 

are accurate. We all have the right to clean air and no one has the right to pollute 

it, no matter how much they pay. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which statement comes closest to your own viewpoint? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IF &quot;BOTH&quot; OR &quot;NEITHER,&quot; ASK: &quot;IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE, 

WHICH ONE COMES CLOSEST TO YOUR VIEWPOINT&quot; </font></p>

Allows polluters to pollute/opponents...68 <br>

NEITHER (DNR)...........................2 <br>

UNSURE/REFUSED (DNR)....................8 </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Thinking about air pollution, do you believe that in the future enforcement 

of clean air laws should get stronger, stay the same, or should be made weaker?

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate who supports
