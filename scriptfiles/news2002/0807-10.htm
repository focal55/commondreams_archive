- August 7 - Boulder Resident Sam Messier participated in a nonviolent demonstration 

in Huwara along with hundreds of local Palestinian and international civilians. 

The village of Huwara has been under curfew for 2 years and has suffered greatly 

due to the heavy military presence. The Palestinian and internationals staged 

a peaceful, nonviolent protest of the curfew in attempt to gain access to food 

and medicine to the villagers. The Israeli army responded with violence using 

live fire, tear gas and sound grenades. &#8220;The IDF reacted in force to the 

nonviolent protest,&#8221; reports Messier via mobile phone from the town of Boreen. 

&#8220;Palestinians were beaten, shots were fired and at least one Palestinian 

had to be carried away from the protest. The only rock that was thrown was thrown 

by an Israeli settler at the Palestinians. The Palestinians never reacted with 

any violence.&#8221;</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Half of the demonstration group decided to march back peacefully chanting and 

singing. Those that stayed were attacked by settlers and settler police. The peace 

activists were thrown into thorn bushes and Huwaida Arraf (USA) was thrown so 

hard she hit her head and was left unconscious for a short time. Adam Shapiro 

(USA) and an unknown Palestinian man were being held in a jeep on a settler road. 

Half decided to stay and block the jeep from leaving with the innocent civilians. 

The group was assured by the military that they would be allowed to retreat but 

then were attacked by the military and arrests were made. At this time the soldiers 

focused in on individuals and began beating and taking people from the group. 

They have taken Palestinians Ahmad Omar Abdel Aziz 19 and Walid Ata Baker 37 a 

glass factory worker. French nationals Pierre Coulon, Anne-Cecele Alligne, Benoit 

Granet, Phillipe Armaug, Satuima Armaug-Khimoum, Americans Adam Shapiro, Javier 

Cortez, and Charles Williams, and Irish national Salah Afifi have been taken to 

the Ariel settlement police station.</font></p>
