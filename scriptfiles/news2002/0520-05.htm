Author of <i>The Beast Reawakens</i>, a book that explores

relations between U.S. intelligence and right-wing extremist groups, Lee said

today: "There is abundant evidence that Bush administration officials

engaged in a post-9/11 cover-up to avoid acknowledging what we now know to be

true -- that the FBI, CIA, and several foreign intelligence sources had picked

up signs of an impending terrorist attack in the United States by bin Laden's

al-Qaeda network. Such revelations underscore the need for a full-fledged

Congressional investigation to explain how and why the U.S. government did not

prevent the atrocities of Sept. 11.... Incompetence, rather than conspiracy,

remains the most plausible explanation for the U.S. government's failure....

We've been told that the CIA has been playing with a weak hand dealt by Bill

Clinton -- that U.S. spies were hamstrung by red tape, which prohibited them

from enlisting terrorists, human rights abusers, and other unsavory characters

as espionage assets -- but this is patently false.... The public would be

well-served if longstanding CIA ties to violent Islamic fundamentalists were

thoroughly scrutinized by Congress and news media."

A former analyst for the CIA, MacMichael said today: "I

certainly support an independent commission. But there is little conflict

between Congress and the executive branch in matters which question the

legitimacy of major government action. The Congressional investigations into

Iran-Contra and the 'October Surprise' covered up more than they

uncovered."

Director of the Peace and Economic Security Program at the

American Friends Service Committee, Gerson said today: "Clearly there were

some intelligence failures. Unfortunately, given where the Democrats are, what

we're likely to see come out of this is more unified intelligence agencies

instead of dealing with Bush's global military crusade. So long as we have a

policy of full-spectrum dominance, we're going to have attacks from any number

of sources."

National coordinator of the National Coalition to Protect

took eight months before describing early warnings about possible

hijackings."
