Mian is co-editor of the book <i>Out of the Nuclear Shadow</i>

and a researcher on South Asian security issues with the Program on Science and

Global Security at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and

International Affairs. He said today: "I'm very disturbed by the Indian

prime minister's speech and his talk of a 'decisive fight.' .... There is no

end in sight to the nuclear danger in South Asia, especially since the U.S. and

Russia have shown with their new nuclear treaty that they have no intention of

putting their nuclear weapons behind them, even though their Cold War ended a

decade ago."

Cabasso is executive director of the Western States Legal

Foundation, which recently released the report "The Shape of Things to

Come: The Nuclear Posture Review, Missile Defense, and the Dangers of a New

Arms Race." She said today: "The Bush-Putin nuclear arms reduction

treaty is a sham. Far from 'liquidating the legacy of the Cold War,' as Bush

claims, the administration's real nuclear weapons agenda can be characterized

as fewer, but newer. As recently confirmed in the Nuclear Posture Review, 'more

useable' precision, low-yield nuclear weapons will be developed to complement

first-strike strategic nuclear weapons, in combination with a suite of missile

defenses and space-based weapons. Together these components constitute one

integrated, offensive global war fighting system."

href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports.html" target="_new">www.worldpolicy.org/projects/arms/reports.html</a><BR>

Hartung is the President's Fellow at the World Policy

Institute at the New School and author of "About Face," a new study

on the role of the arms lobby in shaping the Bush nuclear doctrine, as well as

the report "The Costs of NATO Expansion Revisited." He said today:

"The Bush-Putin accord gives nuclear weapons a new lease on life.... In

the next five years alone, the Bush administration plans to spend an additional

$33 billion on its new strategic 'triad' of long-range strike systems, missile

defenses, and a revitalized nuclear weapons production complex. The Bush

nuclear policy draws heavily on the work of corporate-backed conservative think

tanks like Frank Gaffney's Center for Security Policy and Keith Payne's

National Institute for Public Policy, both of which have close ties with major

nuclear arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin."

Author of <i>Russia Under Yeltsin and Putin</i>, Kagarlitsky

said today: "Russians expect Bush to bring them some reward for the

concessions made in the last months as a contribution to 'the war against

terror.' So far, however, it remains unclear not only what Bush can offer but

even what exactly our leadership wants to get. The real interest of Putin is

that the U.S. administration turns a blind eye to human rights violations in

Russia and Chechnya (knowing well that there will be much more of them in the

near future). This is not hard to get but it is not something that can be

presented to your own people as a great diplomatic achievement."
