Minister Nollet visited Washington yesterday and met with a delegation of the US Green Party to discuss the failure of the United States to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Childhood is the foundation for the future potential of citizens,&quot; said Nollet. &quot;Childhood is when we invest our citizens with basic values of justice, equality, and equal opportunity but also, in the long term, equality with results. Today, we should be concerned about the development of our blossoming young people. To give up ratifying the Convention of the Rights of the Child is to deny the future goals of justice and equality. Such denial scorns the adults of tomorrow and the world that we will leave to them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Green Party of the United States sent a letter (appended below) to President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, urging the United States to ratify the convention and to support a list of positions put forward by the European Ministers in charge of childhood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nollet met with Gail Dixon, a former D.C. Statehood Green Party member of the District of Columbia School Board, Green Party International Committee member Anne Anderson, and Green Party Political Coordinator Dean Myerson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Minister Nollet wanted to know why the United States refuses to participate in the Convention,&quot; said Myerson. &quot;The rest of the world is working to improve the situation for so many children living in poverty in the U.S. and around the world, and the U.S. again is standing aside.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dixon described the poor condition of schools in Washington to Nollet and the challenges faced in providing basic needs for children there, while Anderson described the political blockages to U.S. ratification of the convention.</font></p>

LETTER from the Green Party of the United States</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President George W. Bush<br>

The White House<br>

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW<br>

Washington, DC 20500<br>

May 7, 2002</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear President Bush,</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along with many people in the US and around the world,  the Green Party of the United States supports the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. On the occasion of the UN Special Session on Children starting Wednesday, May 8, we urge you to work with the United States Senate to finally ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We hope that the United States government will take this important step to join other nations in making our world fit for children.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We also ask that the U.S. Representatives become partners with the European Ministers from The European Meeting of Ministers in  charge of Childhood who have put forward a list of positions in regard to the Special Session.  We feel strongly that adopting this document will ensure that basic legal standards are promoted in the protection of children's rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is time for the United States government to start leading the world in demonstrating its concern for the well-being of  children  everywhere. Our support for the Convention on the Rights of the Child will be an important symbolic step in the right direction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,<br>

Green Party of the United States</font></p>
