FRANCISCO - June 25 - The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 
(IGLHRC) has learned that the Egyptian government has decided to retry 50 of the 
defendants in the &quot;Cairo 52&quot; case. The new trial will begin on July 
2, 2002 at the Qasr-al-Nil Court of Misdemeanors in Cairo. The same judge who 
presided over the original trial, Abdel Karim--criticized by attorneys for showing 
open bias--will also preside over this one. The State-controlled daily Al Ahram 
announced the decision on June 23.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We see now our worst suspicions confirmed,&quot; affirmed Scott Long, 
Program Director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. 
&quot;President Mubarak's government made a show of leniency last month, releasing 
the convicted defendants on bail. Now it is cracking down again--and their professions 
of mercy are revealed as a mockery.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Out of the &quot;Cairo 52,&quot; 50 will be sent back into a second trial -- 
both 29 men who were already acquitted in November 2001, and 21 who were convicted 
and saw their sentences quashed last month. Two other men were convicted and saw 
their sentences confirmed by President Mubarak in May; they have no appeal venue 
open to them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Retrying people who have already been acquitted violates basic fairness, 
and basic protections in international law,&quot; said Mr. Long. &quot;We also 
know that one of the convicted men, who has already served his one-year sentence 
and been released, must now return for a new trial. He could be sentenced to even 
more time in prison.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not clear whether the defendants will be arrested and jailed again before 
the trial.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Cairo 52&quot; were first arrested on or around the night of May 
10/11, 2001. That night, police raided the Queen Boat discotheque in Cairo, believed 
to be a gay men's gathering place; other police pickups followed in the next days. 
The 52 were tortured in detention, and jailed continuously until their trial. 
(For more information on procedural irregularities and abuses surrounding the 
trial, see IGLHRC's Fact Sheet, &quot;Egyptian Justice on Trial: The Case of the 
Cairo 52,&quot; at http://www.iglhrc.org/world/africa/Egypt2001Oct.html.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 52 pleaded innocent. The verdicts were handed down on November 14, 2001, 
at a hearing attended by a representative of IGLHRC, among others. Twenty-one 
defendants were convicted of the &quot;habitual practice of debauchery&quot; under 
Article 9(c) of Law 10/1961 (on the Combat of Prostitution). One defendant was 
convicted of &quot;contempt for religion&quot; under Article 98f of the Penal 
Code. Another defendant, accused of being the &quot;ringleader,&quot; was convicted 
of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years at hard labor. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late May, the State Security Office for the Ratification of Verdicts--an 
arm of the Egyptian presidency which is the only possible review for decisions 
of Emergency State Security Courts--cancelled the court decisions in the 50 cases 
involving the &quot;habitual practice of debauchery.&quot; The grounds were that 
this crime did not merit trial before the repressive special courts. The convictions 
of the two defendants for &quot;contempt of religion&quot; were upheld. All but 
those two will now face trial again.</font></p>
