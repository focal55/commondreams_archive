Members of the activist humanitarian group Voices in the Wilderness, Kelly and Guntzel recently got back from Israel and the Occupied Territories. Kelly, the group's co-founder, said today: "We returned from the Jenin camp with ample evidence that the Israeli government ordered Israeli occupying forces to attack and destroy a civilian neighborhood in the Jenin

refugee camp. We would never want to see a single civilian in Israel punished

because of their government's actions. Yet we must ask why the United Nations

continues to uphold a dangerous and repugnant double standard by imposing

lethal punishment on Iraqi civilians ostensibly because of their government's

refusal to comply with UN demands for weapon inspections. With Israel refusing

to cooperate with the UN, will economic sanctions be imposed on it?"</font>

Author of <i>A Chinese Mirror: Moral Reflections on

Political Economy</i>, professor of philosophy emeritus at St. Mary's College

in Maryland and consulting professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, Rosemont

said today: "Usually, being named number two in the Chinese hierarchy

while number one is still operative is a death knell. But thus far Vice

President Hu Jintao is an exception. In some respects, he views the U.S. 'war

on terrorism' favorably since the Chinese leadership is concerned about the

Muslims in western China wanting more independence; the war on terrorism also

deflects from China being seen as the major threat. At the same time he has to

be nervous about U.S. military adventurism. U.S. troops are now in Afghanistan,

Pakistan, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia,

and there's the Seventh Fleet. That fairly well encircles China. The U.S. is

pulling out of the ABM treaty and is building NMD. That might be acceptable to

Russia; they have thousands of warheads and mutually assured destruction is

preserved. But China has less than 40 nuclear missiles. Further, as the U.S.

pressures China, like it did the Soviet Union, to increase manufacture of

weapons, it could be an economic disaster -- as it was for the Soviet

Union."

Visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International

Peace and a former adviser to the two democratically elected previous Pakistani

leaders, Haqqani said today: "Obviously today's referendum is a one-sided

exercise. No campaigning was allowed against the president, or for a boycott.

The government has been saying that the illiterate masses cannot be trusted, so

we need a 'guided democracy,' but the referendum is a convoluted statement

while people are used to symbols on the ballots. There are reports of ballot

tampering, fixing of quotas for public servants to mark ballots and use of

state funds for Gen. Musharaf's campaign. The Pakistani constitution says that

the president should be elected by the parliament and bars a serving military

officer from being president. The real crisis of Pakistan, which is the

legitimacy of its government, will hardly be resolved by this referendum."
