- May 14 - Greens blasted the plans by

President George W. Bush to earmark $300 million of

the $17 billion welfare budget for experiments to

promote marriage as a way to get women off welfare and

to force most welfare recipients to work a 40-hour

work week without child care and benefits.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Too many Democrats crumble when they encounter

Republican rhetoric about family values,&quot; said Rahul

Mahajan, Green candidate for governor of Texas. 

&quot;Bush's plan doesn't promote healthy families or moral

values.  These are schemes to make many women more

helpless and dependent, to push them into jobs and

marriages without regard for the women themselves or

the care and health of children.  They have everything

to do with posturing on the supposed moral

shortcomings of poor people, and nothing to do with

alleviating dependence and poverty.  The real measure

of success is the extent to which any plan reduces

poverty.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;So-called welfare reform often doesn't solve the

problem of getting people into good jobs, because it

neither creates real jobs with good wages nor ensures

good wages and good benefits in jobs that already

exist,&quot; said Robert Miranda, elected Green member of

the Social Development Commission in Milwaukee,

Wisconsin, which is responsible for administering

welfare in that state.  &quot;Instead, welfare reform of

the past decade, whether from Clinton or Bush, has

meant cheap labor and enforced dependence.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greens have called for living wages, full benefits,

collective bargaining rights, and democratic

workplaces for all people who work, including those

moving from relief to jobs.  Greens support national

health insurance for all Americans; assistance for

employment through stable and responsible locally

based business instead of make-work and dead-end

Walmart-wage jobs; and recognition of caregiving as

real work that deserves compensation, not a luxury or

an excuse to avoid jobs.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many Greens want the reauthorization of Temporary Aid

to Needy Families (TANF) to increase investments in

child care, education and training, and job creation

rather than impose stricter workfare requirements on

states and participants as proposed by Democrats and Republicans in Congress.  Greens cite the Carter-Bayh bill, supported by liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton (NY) and John Rockefeller (WV), which includes such regressive agenda and which would also divert TANF funding to noncustodial parents and to groups that seek to win custody rights over children for abusive spouses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Do all poor people have to return to slavery and

indentured servitude before Congress finds the

backbone to say no to Bush's insane welfare

proposal?,&quot; asked Donna Warren, Green candidate for

Lieutenant Governor of California.  &quot;Bush's plan is counterproductive, disrupting, and drains money from efforts to move poor people from government dependency.  The Greens know this, 39 states know this, and Bush knows this.  It is amazing that Congress pretends not to know.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Green activists and candidates list specific dangers

in the Bush plan:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** It doesn't provide what many mothers trying to

rejoin the work force need most: child care, training

and education where effective (especially GED

preparation and English as a Second Language), and transportation.  &quot;At the same time Bush would expand the workfare requirement to 40 hours a week, there's no acknowledgement that working mothers have special needs,&quot; said Miranda.  &quot;It's devastating for many women and some men who take care of children, elderly, or disabled family members.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** Bush's plan discriminates against mothers,

including lesbian mothers, who need help but may find themselves barred from public housing and other relief.  The plan creates a second-class level of 'undeserving' lesbian mothers and single heterosexual mothers who are unwilling or unable to wed. 

Proponents claim the plan will strengthen marriage. 

But by compelling marriage solely for economic

convenience, the plan encourages unstable, temporary,

and even exploitative relationships.  &quot;Many women who

remain single or have separated from partners in order

to escape exploitation, abuse, or dependence will now

find themselves thrust back into the kind of

circumstances that forced them to seek welfare in the

first place,&quot; said Mark Dunlea, Vice-Chair of Green

Party of New York State.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*** The plan's &quot;Super Waiver&quot; option allows states to

spend welfare relief and job training funds on

projects like the promotion of marriage.  It also

allows some faith-based organizations -- groups that

seek exemption from discrimination statutes in hiring

and training, providing services, and licensing

requirements -- to claim larger shares of public

funding.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I thought Republicans opposed 'social engineering',&quot;

observed Dr. Jonathan Farley, Green Party congressional candidate from Tennessee.  &quot;I don't want

to be married by Big Government.  I want to be married

by a priest.&quot;</font></p>
