- September 5 - Wind power, a non-polluting renewable energy source long ignored 

by the nation&#8217;s utilities, is getting a major boost in Texas, where more 

than $1 billion was invested in the technology in 2001, according to a new report 

released today by Public Citizen and the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development 

(SEED) Coalition.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The winds of change are coming 

to the heart of oil country,&quot; said Thomas &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, director 

of Public Citizen&#8217;s Texas office. &quot;Because of state policies that encourage 

the development of alternative energy sources, we are seeing wind farms sprouting 

across the Texas plains, and that means cleaner air, less dependence on foreign 

oil sources and a shot in the arm to the state&#8217;s economy as well.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the report, written 

by Virtus Energy Research Associates on behalf of Public Citizen and the SEED 

Coalition, the wind power that could be generated in Texas is enormous &#8211; 

more than 10 times greater than all electricity currently sold in the state. Just 

as Texas became a dominant player in oil production in the 20th century, it could 

become a global leader in the renewable energy field. The large wind installations 

in Texas are among the lowest cost sources of wind power in the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smith said the development of wind 

power in the state was boosted by the Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard created 

by the Texas Legislature in 1999. That law requires that 2,000 megawatts of electricity 

from renewable sources be added to the state by 2009. The report found that:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2001, Texas installed more wind 

power than the entire United States had ever installed in any previous year. Last 

year, utilities and wind companies invested $1 billion to build 912 megawatts 

of new capacity, bringing the state to a total wind power capacity of 1,100 megawatts. 

The goal of the 1999 law is 2,000 megawatts of new capacity by 2009. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Recently completed wind plants created 

2,500 jobs with a payroll of $75 million. They will deliver $13.3 million in tax 

revenue for schools and counties, and will pay landowners $2.5 million in royalties 

in 2002 alone. Using a multiplier effect, this new investment activity is estimated 

to stimulate another 2,900 jobs in Texas. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> By 2020, wind power in Texas alone 

could be responsible for 8,500 jobs with a payroll of $255 million, and could 

be generating $1.4 billion worth of electricity yearly. </font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Wind power is bringing relief 

to parched economies in West Texas and creating manufacturing jobs throughout 

the state,&quot; said Peter Altman, executive director of the SEED Coalition. 

&quot;Local leaders recognize the opportunities and want to see more wind power.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the recommendations in the 

report is the establishment of state and federal goals of generating 10 percent 

of electricity through the use of renewable sources by 2020. If Texas were to 

meet that goal, that would mean 13,400 megawatts of wind capacity would be needed. 

According to the report, that would represent a capital investment of $12.4 billion, 

would create 18,300 jobs and generate more than $215 annually in local taxes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Just as President Bush is promoting 

retrograde policies that promote more oil and gas production, which will only 

make our air dirtier and further solidify our dependence on the unstable world 

oil market, his home state is leading the nation in promoting this wonderful new, 

unlimited source of energy,&quot; Smith said. &quot;And it&#8217;s creating jobs 

at the same time.&quot;</font></p>
