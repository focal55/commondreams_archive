<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - July 23 - Statement 

of Ralph G. Neas, President, People For the American Way:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Bush administration&#8217;s 

decision to withhold funding approved by Congress for the United Nations Population 

Fund (UNFPA) is a deplorable game of politics that will affect the most vulnerable 

people in the world. Scoring political points with the Religious Right at the 

expense of poor women around the globe is an act of rank political expediency. 

It is hard to imagine just what &#8220;compassionate conservatism&#8221; means 

to this administration. By holding this funding hostage, the current administration 

shows its true colors and demonstrates the significant impact the Religious Right 

still has behind closed doors.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This decision isolates the United States from some of our closest allies. For 

example, a British parliamentary delegation found no evidence to support the charges 

made by the anti-choice Population Research Institute that the UNFPA tolerates 

China&#8217;s coercive policies and involuntary abortions and sterilization. UNFPA 

works in developing countries to save thousands of women and children&#8217;s 

lives every year, prevent abortions, help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and promote 

human rights through better reproductive health care.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Bush signed into law the legislation that contained the $34 million, he 

added the accompanying statement, &#8220;additional discretion to determine the 

appropriate level of funding for the United Nations Population Fund&#8221; to 

allow himself a way out. His actions are earning him praise from Religious Right 

leaders. But his decision does not merit praise. It will undermine the UNFPA&#8217;s 

ability to prevent the deaths of 4,700 mothers and 77,000 children under the age 

of five. It will also undermine their ability to prevent 800,000 abortions and 

jeopardize the agency&#8217;s AIDS prevention programs. The president has not 

taken a stand for life when he is sacrificing millions of the world&#8217;s poorest 

women and children for domestic political gain.</font></p>
