<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - August 27 - The 

East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) said today that it was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; 

by East Timor's decision to give U.S. troops in the new nation immunity from prosecution 

by the International Criminal Court (ICC).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are deeply disturbed and angered that the U.S. government pressured 

East Timor to exempt U.S. troops from the ICC. The East Timorese suffered greatly 

during the U.S.-supported illegal occupation of their homeland when the Indonesian 

military committed the very crimes that the ICC is designed to discourage,&quot; 

said John M. Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">East Timor's parliament ratified the Treaty of Rome establishing a permanent 

ICC on August 12. East Timor is the third country to sign an Article 98 agreement 

with the U.S. granting immunity. The others are Romania and Israel. The ICC can 

hear cases of genocide and crimes against humanity committed after July 1, 2002.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When joining the court, East Timor affirmed its commitment to human rights 

and universal justice. Now, with the stroke of a pen, the East Timorese government 

has undermined these principles,&quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, the U.S. has used the UN peacekeeping mission in East Timor as a 

bargaining chip in its campaign to undermine the ICC. Last May, the Security Council 

rejected a U.S. proposal to exempt from ICC jurisdiction peacekeepers with the 

post-independence UN Mission in East Timor (UNMISET). Although the U.S. voted 

to establish the mission, it refused to replace three unarmed military observers 

assigned to UNMISET, apparently to send a warning during the contentious debate 

over renewal of the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ETAN also urged East Timor not to sign additional agreements renouncing jurisdiction 

over U.S. soldiers. &quot;There are reports the U.S. government has proposed that 

East Timor sign a Status of Forces Agreement with the U.S. which would exempt 

U.S. military personnel in East Timor from any criminal prosecution. Although 

such agreements have provided exemptions for U.S. personnel in the past, many 

now allow host countries to retain the right of jurisdiction in cases of overriding 

national interest or of widespread public concern,&quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The history of East Timor demonstrates why a single standard of justice 

and strong enforcement mechanisms are vital. The ICC is designed to deter and 

prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide of the nature committed 

during decades of Indonesian occupation. We are concerned that East Timor, which 

struggled so valiantly for many years to achieve independence and rule-of-law, 

is being asked to abandon these principles,&quot; said Miller.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Recent acquittals by the Indonesian ad hoc court on East Timor of Indonesian 

security officers accused of crimes against humanity have strengthened calls for 

genuine justice for East Timor. This dramatically illustrates the need for international 

mechanisms to address serious crimes including an ad hoc international tribunal 

for past crimes in East Timor and an uncompromised permanent international court 

for current and future crimes,&quot; he added.</font></p>
