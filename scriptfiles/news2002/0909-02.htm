YORK - September 9 - One year after the tragic terrorist attacks of September 

11, much has fundamentally changed in America. Some of these changes, like a renewed 

sense of national purpose, are heartening. Yet much else is deeply disturbing 

to those who cherish freedom and the American way of life. And perhaps the most 

disturbing change is the government&#8217;s apparent belief that our society cannot 

be both safe and free. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly the terrorists who attacked 

us took insidious advantage of our tolerance and our love of liberty -- enjoying 

our freedoms while plotting our destruction. But does that mean our freedoms are 

at fault? Or that being tolerant of others is wrong? Our answer is an emphatic 

&quot;NO.&quot; The principles enshrined in our Constitution are the bedrock of 

our country. They define us as a people. They are the source of our strength as 

a nation. They are our enduring legacy to the world. Defending them in a time 

of national crisis is more than an act of patriotism -- it is a moral imperative. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As numerous polls have shown, many 

Americans are concerned about the ongoing erosion of their basic freedoms in the 

name of unproven security measures. Examples include the government&#8217;s plan 

to recruit American workers - including bus and truck drivers -- to spy on their 

fellow Americans; the secrecy surrounding the hundreds of Arabs, South Asians 

and Muslims who have been detained or deported; the plan to monitor confidential 

attorney-client conversations; the selective enforcement of immigration laws based 

on race, ethnicity and country of origin; and the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act 

and the often-unchecked powers it gave law enforcement agencies. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of particular concern about USA PATRIOT 

and other government actions are the new security measures that erode and evade 

judicial review. Checks and balances are the cornerstone of our democracy. The 

Founders established the judicial branch of government to protect our rights, 

a role they can&#8217;t play if Congress explicitly forbids them from even reviewing 

and law enforcement actions. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet the courts have shown remarkable 

resilience and courage in the face of government power grabs. In case after case 

brought by the ACLU and others, courts have repudiated the government&#8217;s 

continued attempts to shroud its actions in secrecy. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most recently, on August 26, a unanimous 

federal appeals court panel in Ohio struck down the government's blanket policy 

of conducting secret deportation hearings in post-Sept. 11 cases. As Judge Damon 

Keith, author of the decision, so eloquently put it, &#8220;Democracies die behind 

closed doors.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier that same week, a newly released 

decision from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court rebuked the government's 

response to last year's terrorist attacks and exposed Attorney General John Ashcroft's 

efforts to use intelligence powers to circumvent the Constitution. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This week, as the nation marks a 

tragic anniversary when thousands of innocent men and women died, we at the ACLU 

are also mourning our friends and neighbors who died at the World Trade Center 

and those who perished at the Pentagon and in the crash outside Pittsburgh. But 

our sadness is tempered by our belief in the strength of our democratic traditions 

and our nation's love of liberty. Now more than ever, we must have the courage 

of America&#8217;s convictions, and we must lead with our values rather than follow 

our fears. </font></p>
