- July 15 -&nbsp; America's investors, employees and pensioners can take heart 
that the Senate is starting to look out for their interests. The Sarbanes bill 
emerged from the Senate stronger than when it came in -- strengthened by amendments 
that would broaden the definition of corporate fraud and increase the penalties 
for fraud and document destruction. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bill attempts to guarantee auditor 
independence, but leaves the SEC with too much discretion to define which consulting 
services accounting firms can offer their audit clients. We also regret a provision 
to keep disciplinary proceedings against accounting firms secret until their final 
phase. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the real challenge now is to 
keep the Senate bill from being gutted in conference committee. We call on Senator 
Daschle and Speaker Hastert to name conferees who believe strong, swift reform 
is needed to answer the crisis of market confidence. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The House-passed bill is a relic 
of calmer markets. America can ill afford such a cynical move to protect campaign 
donors in the accounting industry from the consequences of their inaction. The 
House should pass a motion to instruct conferees to agree to stronger Senate language. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, House Financial Services 
Chairman Michael Oxley (R-OH) is expected to chair the conference committee, and 
he has not grasped the urgency of the crisis in financial markets. He has criticized 
the Senate for rushing to enact reforms, calling the debate a &quot;feeding frenzy.&quot; 
Investors are more likely to view the accounting industry, not reformers, as the 
sharks taking a bite out of their portfolios. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bacgkround: According to CQ Weekly, 
citing the value of U.S. stocks, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 stock index, 
since March 2000, the value of all U.S. stocks has plunged by $7 trillion. </font></p>
