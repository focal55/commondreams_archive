Detroit Edison's Highly Radioactive Fermi Nuclear Plant Waste  Could Travel Grand Trunk Western Railway</font></div>

- May 29 - According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), 

highly radioactive nuclear fuel rods could travel the same Grand Trunk 

Western (GTW) railway that experienced the train derailment and propane 

spill in Potterville on Memorial Day. Concerned citizens' groups fear 

that if high-level nuclear waste were to be involved in a massive 

propane explosion or fire, as was narrowly averted in Potterville, a 

radioactive catastrophe could result. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DOE's high-level nuclear waste transportation route maps were released 

in February, 2002 as part of the Final Environmental Impact Statement 

for the proposed national geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. 

Nuclear waste from Detroit Edison's Fermi nuclear plant near Monroe 

could be hauled by rail through Detroit, Pontiac, Durand, Lansing, 

Potterville, Charlotte, Battle Creek, Climax, Scotts, Vicksburg, 

Schoolcraft, Marcellus, and Cassopolis before leaving Michigan. The DOE 

route map for Michigan is attached. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The DOE report also shows that 6,429 irradiated fuel assemblies weighing 

1,160 tons could travel the GTW route through Michigan over the course 

of 24 to 38 years. In a 1995 report, the State of Nevada Agency for 

Nuclear Projects reported that 131 rail casks from Fermi nuclear plant 

could travel the GTW line through Michigan on their way to Yucca 

Mountain, Nevada. The Nevada State Agency for Nuclear Projects has 

posted DOE's route maps on-line at: <br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is very disturbing to think what might have happened had that 

derailed train been shipping nuclear waste along with its hundreds of 

thousands of gallons of explosive propane,&quot; said Kevin Kamps, Nuclear 

Waste Specialist at Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service in 

Washington, D.C. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kamps is a native of Kalamazoo and a board member of Don't Waste 

Michigan, the state-wide citizens coalition concerned with nuclear power 

and radioactive waste issues. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;DOE's Yucca Mountain plan, soon to be voted on in the U.S. Senate, 

would allow for high-level nuclear waste to be shipped on trains 

carrying other hazardous, flammable, and explosive chemicals,&quot; Kamps 

said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nuclear waste shipping containers are not required to withstand such a 

massive explosion or long duration, high temperature fire,&quot; Kamps said. &quot;Release of even a small fraction of the radioactive cargo could spell 

catastrophe for an entire region.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Marvin Resnikoff, a University of Michigan educated nuclear 

physicist, has calculated that each of the 131 rail containers of atomic 

waste from Fermi could hold over two hundred times the long-lasting 

radiation released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its Yucca Mtn. Environmental Assessment (1986), DOE reported that a 

fiery accident releasing just a fraction of the atomic waste in a 

shipping container could contaminate a 42 square mile area, costing $620 

million and taking a year and three months to clean up. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires nuclear waste casks to 

be designed to withstand a 1,475 degree Fahrenheit fire for 30 minutes. 

But propane flame temperatures top 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit (Resnikoff, &quot;Next Nuclear Gamble,&quot; 1983, p. 229) and real life train fires have 

burned out of control for many hours or even days. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Given the potentially catastrophic risks of severe transport accidents 

and even terrorist attacks on shipments, Senators Stabenow and Levin 

should vote against the nuclear industry-driven rush to transport 

high-level radioactive waste through the major cities of Michigan,&quot; 

Kamps said. &quot;A major radiation release could mean evacuating 

Potterville, and even Lansing, not for just a few days, but forever.&quot;</font></p>
