- July 24 - Citing recent reports of excessive police violence in separate incidences 

in California and Oklahoma, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), called 

such abuses of police power symptomatic of a justice system &#8220;gone awry.&#8221;</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFSC national criminal justice representative Tonya McClary said police abuses 

such as those captured on videotape - levied against 16-year old Donovan Jackson 

of Los Angeles, and Donald Reed Pete of Oklahoma - circumvent and cross the boundaries 

of the legitimate demands of justice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jackson was a passenger in a car stopped by Los Angeles County police in his 

hometown suburb of Inglewood for having expired vehicle tags. A bystander with 

a video camera caught a white police officer lifting the already cuffed African-American 

minor to his feet and slamming his face onto a squad car before repeatedly striking 

him in the face with his fist. Within a week of Jackson&#8217;s arrest, two white 

Oklahoma City police officers were also caught on videotape using pepper spray 

and violently striking Pete, a black man arrested on charges of lewd behavior 

and illegal substance possession. According to the Oklahoma City police department, 

Pete was &#8220;slow to respond to police orders,&#8221; but not &#8220;actively 

resisting.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both incidents took place in routine stop-and-search situations. According 

to the widely accepted United Nations Code of Conduct for Enforcement Officials, 

force should be used only as a &#8220;last resort&#8221; and must be proportionate 

to the threat posed. Given that both Jackson and Pete were handcuffed and presented 

little or no actual resistance, the blatant aggression demonstrated by the police 

seems to be in clear violation of UN and international standards. Other human 

rights groups have also responded strongly to the incidents.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;When the penalty for a routine traffic stop is a violent beating, the 

system has failed,&#8221; McClary states. In addition, McClary questioned what 

she called &#8220;society&#8217;s increased reliance on violence and punitive 

action to solve problems that are social or economic at base.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a California state commission hearing on police conduct, convened in response 

to the case, University of Southern California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky 

stressed that the July 6 incident should not be dismissed as an isolated incident, 

but was part of a pattern of police culture. &#8220;It's a culture that causes 

officers to think in an &#8216;us-against-them&#8217; mentality, to think of those 

in the community as less than human,&#8221; Chemerinsky said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The &#8216;us-against-them&#8217; mentality extends further than the 

badge,&#8221; according to Walidah Imarisha, also with the AFSC criminal justice 

program. &#8220;When you have a police force that is predominately white, in communities 

that are predominately of color, that creates a dangerous imbalance,&#8221; she 

says. &#8220;Adding more officers of color won&#8217;t solve the problem,&#8221; 

Imarisha feels, &#8220;because the training that police receive creates a climate 

of fear and hostility toward people of color - especially young black men.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dramatic expansion of law enforcement in the United States over the past 

thirty years has resulted in widespread and persistent violations of civil, constitutional, 

and human rights, McClary emphasized. &#8220;Increasingly enforcement has become 

a seamless web through which authorities may move without hindrance,&#8221; she 

states. &#8220;At the same time, a variety of regressive legislation enacted in 

recent years has sharply restricted avenues for legal redress for those entangled 

in its threads.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jeremy Morse and Bijan Darvish, the police officers under investigation in 

the Donovan case, are currently on administrative leave with pay. Mitchell Crooks, 

27, who recorded the amateur video, has publicly stated he now fears for his life 

after being questioned by LA prosecutors. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker humanitarian and social 

justice agency based in Philadelphia. The struggle for immigrants&#8217; rights 

and resistance to the systemic violence and dehumanization of the criminal justice 

system are major elements of AFSC&#8217;s work for justice within the United States. 

Each, the group states, is a central focus of the complex intertwining of violence, 

social exclusion, and economic exploitation in U.S. society - and each represents 

a profoundly significant site of resistance and grassroots mobilization.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;AFSC encourages collaboration in social transformation towards a national 

community that recognizes that police violence has no place in a system of fair 

and equitable justice,&#8221; McClary states. &#8220;No matter how you look at 

it, two wrongs never make a right.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The American Friends Service Committee is a Quaker organization that includes 

people of various faiths who are committed to social justice, peace and humanitarian 

service. Its work is based on the belief in the worth of every person and faith 

in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice.</i></font></p>
