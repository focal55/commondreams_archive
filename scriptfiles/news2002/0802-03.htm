Gravel, currently president of Direct Democracy and sponsor of the National Initiative 

for Democracy, was a noted critic of the Vietnam War while in the Senate. He entered 

the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record. He said today: "This is a déjà 

vu of Tonkin and the evidence seems to be as flimsy. [Senate Foreign Relations 

Committee chairman J. William] Fulbright's biggest regret, he would later say, 

was signing off on the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964. The incident was a lie 

about a supposed attack on U.S. vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin, fabricated by the 

Johnson government to give legitimacy to the expansion of the Vietnam War. There 

seems to be a similar rush to a 'Tonkin judgment' in the Senate to give the Bush 

administration legitimacy for an attack on Iraq. A 'War on Terror' is a diffused 

type of Cold War, which is worldwide, even in Oklahoma and New York. To sustain 

the war fever the administration hawks need a hot war to sustain a national war 

mentality..."</p>

Solomon is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy. His op-ed 

piece in today's <i>Los Angeles Times</i> is highly critical of the Senate Foreign 

Relations Committee, which has just concluded two days of hearings on Iraq. The 

committee is playing a very different role than when the Senate panel aired dissenting 

perspectives during early years of the Vietnam War, the article says. "Transfixed 

with tactical issues, none of the senators on television in recent days would 

dream of acknowledging the present relevance of a statement made by Senator [Wayne] 

Morse a third of a century ago: 'We're going to become guilty, in my judgment, 

of being the greatest threat to the peace of the world. It's an ugly reality, 

and we Americans don't like to face up to it.'"</p>

Senior research fellow at the World Policy Institute and co-author of "Axis of 

Influence: Behind the Bush Administration's Missile Defense Program," Hartung 

said today: "With House passage last week of the $10 billion 'Cost of War Against 

Terrorism Authorization Act,' Congress has signed off on more than $150 billion 

in new military spending in the first 19 months of the Bush administration. If, 

as suspected, these new funds are to be diverted to prepare for war against Iraq, 

the immense costs incurred so far by the Bush administration's ... open-ended 

'war on terrorism' will be just the down payment on a massive buildup that could 

exceed the military spending binge of the Reagan era."</p>

Associate professor of history at the University of Houston, Buzzanco is author 

of <i>Masters of War: Military Dissent and Politics in the Vietnam Era</i> and 

<i>Vietnam and the Transformation of American Life</i>. He said today: "It's important 

to remember that while everyone talks of the anti-war movement in the 1960s, the 

Gulf of Tonkin resolution passed in 1964 by 98 to 2. Fulbright only held hearings 

after there was a people's movement against the war. Congress rarely has the courage 

to do something on its own and debate is limited over the tactics of how to attack. 

Often what drives war is not what's actually happening in Southeast Asia or the 

Mideast, but the perceived interests of some domestic groups."</p>
