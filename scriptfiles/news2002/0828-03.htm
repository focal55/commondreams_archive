<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CARY, NORTH CAROLINA - August 

28 - Victims of terrorism and war from Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian 

territories, the Philippines, and Japan will join family members of September 

11 victims for a joint speaking tour in the days immediately before and after 

September 11, 2002. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The “No More Victims” tour, 

co-sponsored by September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows and the American 

Friends Service Committee, will place the human dimension and experience of the 

9-11 attacks and of war at the center of the national debate over the "war against 

terrorism." In doing so, the participants hope to educate and to raise public 

consciousness about the meanings and consequences of war by providing a thought-provoking 

dialogue. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“By putting a human face 

on the casualties of terrorism and war, we hope to demonstrate the price of responding 

to violence with violence,” says David Potorti, Co-Director, Eastern U.S. Coordinator 

of Peaceful Tomorrows. “The true cost of the U.S. war on terror, in human terms, 

is reflected in the experiences of these people, which have led them to seek alternatives.” 

Potorti lost his brother, James, at the World Trade Center on September 11. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“In joining the 9-11 families 

with the voices and stories of others who have suffered around the world since 

September 11, we hope to shatter some of the illusions maintaining that ‘war will 

solve our problems,’” says tour organizer Joseph Gerson of the AFSC. “We firmly 

believe that the real lesson of September 11 is that war and violence are the 

problems, not the solutions.” </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following statements by 

all of the participants, time will be allowed for questions and public dialogue 

with members of the audience. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>September 11 Families 

for Peaceful Tomorrows (<a href="http://www.peacefultomorrows.org" target="_new">www.peacefultomorrows.org</a>) 

is an advocacy organization formed by family members of September 11 victims. 

Its mission is to seek effective, nonviolent responses to terrorism, and to identify 

a commonality with all people similarly affected by violence throughout the world. 

The group is urging the American government to create a fund that would compensate 

Afghan people who lost members of their family to the war. On Sept. 11, the group, 

along with U.N. General Assembly President Mr. Jan Kavan and U.N. Secretary-General 

Kofi Annan, will be honored at an interfaith service marking the opening of the 

57th Session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled, “A Celebration of 

Remembrance and Hope, Dedicated to Victims of Violence Everywhere.” </i></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Founded in 1917 to provide 

conscientious objectors with an opportunity to aid civilian victims during World 

War I, AFSC (<a href="http://www.afsc.org" target="_new">www.afsc.org</a>) is 

grounded in Quaker beliefs respecting the dignity and worth of every person. AFSC 

has programs in the United States, and in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the 

Middle East that focus on issues related to economic justice, peace-building and 

demilitarization, social justice, and youth. In 1947, the AFSC and the British 

Friends Service Council received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the Religious 

Society of Friends, for humanitarian service, work for reconciliation, and the 

spirit in which these were carried out. </i></font></p>
