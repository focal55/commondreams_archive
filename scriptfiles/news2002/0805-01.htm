IRAQ - August 5 - On August 6th, 6 Americans on the 44th Voices in the Wilderness 

(VitW) peace delegation to Iraq will be fasting in front of UN Headquarters in 

Baghdad, in protest of continuing US/UN Sanctions and bombings on Iraq. August 

6th marks the 12th Anniversary of the Sanctions. Other members of VitW have already 

begun a 40-day fast at UN headquarters in New York City, titled &#8220;Breaking 

Ranks and Building Bridges.&#8221; Peaceful Tomorrows, an organization of family 

members of victims of 9/11 dedicated to non-violent solutions, will join Voices 

in breaking this fast on September 11th.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Breaking Ranks</b><br>

The focus of &#8220;Breaking Ranks and Building Bridges&#8221; is to encourage 

the UN, and people around the world, to break ranks with the US to end 12 years 

of genocidal sanctions. The UN is clear about the effects of its own policy: &#8220;The 

past decade has witnessed the emergence of a large body of wasted, stunted, and 

impoverished children in violation of the right to life and survival.&#8221; (UNICEF, 

Situation of Children in Iraq, 2002)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kathy Kelly, co-founder of VitW asserts, &#8220;Across Iraq, people ask us 

why Americans want to punish them even more. For 12 years they've been told sanctions 

were a &#8216;peaceful&#8217; alternative to war, and now they're told war is 

the solution to the suffering of sanctions. In a twisted way the message is at 

least consistent: to please remember that they're better off dead.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Delegation member, Lisa Amman, director of Peace and Social Justice at St. 

Luke&#8217;s Catholic Church in St. Paul, MN, agrees, &#8220;It is unbearable 

that 5 Americans choosing not to eat for 24 hours in Baghdad, or 12 Americans 

not eating for 40 days in New York City, is more newsworthy than millions of Iraqi 

children hit by malnutrition, and even death, as a result of Sanctions.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Building Bridges</b><br>

VitW will begin an &#8220;Iraq Peace Team&#8221; and place 100 nonviolent activists 

in Iraq, both before and during a US attack. Without respect to world opinion, 

US planning for more war is taking precedent over finding peaceful solutions to 

12 years of ongoing war. The Iraq Peace Team intends to create a space for alternative 

information that would include video footage and audio reports from team members 

inside Iraq, interviews with specialists who have lived and worked in Iraq, and 

perspectives from people dedicated to nonviolent means to resolve disputes. </font></p>
