- September 10 - In today's Miami-Dade election that featured a historic gay rights 

ballot measure, registered voters have once again been denied the right to cast 

votes. Rampant breakdowns in new touch screen voting machines, failure to open 

polling places in a timely manner, untrained personnel, and refusal by election 

officials to provide paper "provisional" ballots when voting machines have malfunctioned 

have left voters and observers alike stunned and angered. 

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Worst of all, numerous complaints have been registered by voters who went to 

the polls to vote NO on the anti-gay ballot measure, but were prevented from doing 

so. In some precincts, there was no ability to vote on any initiatives. In others, 

voters have complained that when they voted NO on the anti-gay ballot measure, 

YES votes appear to have registered instead. Many polling places were not operative 

until after 1 p.m., more than 5 hours later than the scheduled 7 a.m. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In 2000, African Americans in southern Florida were denied the right to vote 

and to have their votes counted. In 2002, the gay and Jewish communities are facing 

the same inexcusable fate," said Lorri L. Jean, executive director of the National 

Gay and Lesbian Task Force. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While irregularities have been reported in precincts countywide, Miami's Jewish 

and gay communities have been disproportionately hit by voter machine malfunction 

and other irregularities. These communities represent some of the strongest opposition 

to a measure on the ballot that, if passed, would remove discrimination protections 

based on sexual orientation from the County's human rights ordinance. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"How many times must historically oppressed communities be denied the right 

to participate in elections under the watch of Jeb and George W. Bush?" demanded 

Jean. "Hundreds and potentially thousands of people in Miami-Dade have been unable 

to vote today because of malfunctioning machines and then have been provided no 

alternative means of voting. This is not a partisan failure, this is a leadership 

failure." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"After the last Florida voting fiasco, Jeb and George Bush promised the American 

public that they would make every vote count," Jean continued. "They have had 

two years to create a system that guaranteed full participation in the democratic 

process to all people and, as we now know, they have failed to deliver on their 

promise." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, NGLTF is demanding that the Governor employ all available communication 

devices and personnel at the state's disposal to let voters know that voting hours 

have now been extended until 9 p.m. and to encourage them to return to the polls. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Further, we are demanding full and immediate investigations by the Governor's 

office and the U.S. Department of Justice into the failures of the Florida election 

system so that the gay community and indeed all Floridians will never again be 

denied that opportunity to vote and have those votes counted," Jean concluded.</i></font></p>
