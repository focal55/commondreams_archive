ANGELES - July 22 - California Governor Gray Davis today signs a pioneering measure 

to protect California's health and environment by reducing global warming pollution 

from all new cars and trucks sold in the state, America's largest automobile market. 

The law demonstrates that Americans can and will meet the global warming challenge, 

and reaffirms California's worldwide leadership in pollution safeguards and clean 

vehicle technology.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law -- known as AB 1493 -- is the first of its kind anywhere in world, 

and marks a dramatic change in the national global warming debate, according to 

NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council). It reaffirms California's successful 

40-year leadership in pollution safeguards and clean vehicle technologies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have the know-how to solve this problem safely and affordably. The 

law is proof that America doesn't have to take global warming lying down,&quot; 

said Ann Notthoff, NRDC's California Advocacy Director. &quot;This is a bold stroke 

for the people of California, and an enormous credit to Governor Davis and the 

legislators who fought to get it to his desk.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduced by Assemblymember Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), AB 1493 requires 

automakers for the first time to limit heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions 

(CO2), which form a thickening blanket in the atmosphere. It also will reduce 

other pollutants, and save consumers money at the gas pump.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Common Sense Solution 

to a California Problem</b><br>

California is second only to Texas in carbon dioxide emissions, with cars and 

light trucks responsible for 40 percent of it. Just last month, researchers from 

several California universities published a new study documenting the severe threat 

of global warming to the state's water supply. Other experts warn of increased 

wildfire risk, added strain on the electric grid, and deterioration in air quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The law constitutes a major victory over a multi-million dollar campaign by 

car companies to defeat it. Despite the barrage of negative advertising, more 

than 80 percent of state residents support the global warming pollution cuts, 

according to a June poll by the non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Californians support this bill because they know global warming threatens 

our quality of life,&quot; Notthoff said. &quot;Instead of fighting the law, we 

encourage the auto industry to face this challenge the same way we do, with the 

same spirit of innovation that makes California the fifth largest economy in the 

world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>National Ramifications 

for Politicians, Automakers</b><br>

The new law has important national impact as well. In June the Bush administration 

released a startling report acknowledging the dangerous and costly effects of 

global warming in the U.S. and conceding that pollution is in fact to blame (findings 

that echo longstanding scientific consensus). This follows the President's withdrawal 

last year from an international global warming treaty, and his continuing opposition 

to domestic CO2 emission limits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Washington can't have it both ways. Scientists have given us the diagnosis; 

even the administration has accepted it. Now California is showing us there's 

a cure,&quot; said David G. Hawkins, director of the NRDC Climate Center. &quot;We 

have the solutions to fix this problem, but we have to start now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last week 11 state attorneys general -- including California's Bill Lockyer 

-- urged President Bush to reconsider his stance and start addressing the problem. 

They say the White House vacuum is forcing states to act in place of the federal 

government. The result, they said, would be patchwork regulation, slower results 

and higher costs. As in past pollution battles, increasing action at the state 

level will raise pressure on Washington to step in.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the meantime, other states may be considering California's new tailpipe 

standard. California is the only state allowed to create it's own emissions standards. 

But under a special provision of the Clean Air Act, any state is free to adopt 

the tougher measures in place of weaker federal rules.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Clean Solutions Exist 

Today to Cut CO2</b><br>

Like California's other pollution control innovations, NRDC predicts the bill 

will spur technological advances in Detroit, Tokyo and other automotive capitals. 

Unfortunately, protests to the contrary by automaker lobbyists have become standard 

procedure in these debates. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Carmakers have protested every health and safety rule ever written, everything 

from seat belts to smog controls. Eventually the public prevails, and the industry 

finds a way to meet the standards. That's why cars and trucks today are safer, 

cleaner and more powerful than ever,&quot; Hawkins said. &quot;We can meet this 

challenge quickly once the auto company lobbyists step aside and let their engineers 

get to work.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cost-effective technologies are already available that would reduce CO2 and 

other global warming pollutants from cars and light trucks of all sizes. Advances 

in engine and transmission technology, as well as improved aerodynamics and better 

tires all offer big opportunities. Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler have all announced 

plans to produce low CO2, fuel-efficient hybrid SUVs within the next few years. 

AB 1493 would accelerate the process, making cleaner solutions available sooner 

for more buyers across a broader range of vehicles.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Broad Support for an 

Innovative Bill</b><br>

The global warming pollution bill has broad support from leading figures in California's 

high technology industry. The law is a top priority for NRDC and its 95,000 California 

members, as well as the American Lung Association of California and nearly all 

the state's major environmental organizations. Other supporters include the California 

Teachers Association, California Nurses Association and the California Professional 

Firefighters.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Local government support comes from the cities of Los Angeles, San Jose, San 

Diego and San Francisco, as well as the Bay Area Air Quality Management District 

and water management authorities in Marin County, Santa Clara County and the East 

Bay. U.S. Senators Feinstein and Boxer and a majority of the state's House delegation 

also back the bill. The bill has endorsements from all the major state newspapers, 

including the Los Angeles Times, Sacramento Bee, San Francisco Chronicle and San 

Jose Mercury News.</font></p>
