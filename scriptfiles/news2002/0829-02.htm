<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 29 - 

More than three hundred citizens groups from 41 countries presented a petition 

today to a World Bank-affiliated court, demanding that it allow public participation 

in a controversial case in which Bechtel Corporation is suing Bolivia for $25 

million. (Petition and support letter available at: <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/news/display.html?ID=435" target="_new">http://www.earthjustice.org/news/display.html?ID=435</a>)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bechtel is suing South America's 

poorest country for a portion of the profits it wasn't able to earn after a public 

uprising in response to Bechtel's water rate hikes forced the company to depart 

from the country in April 2000. Bechtel's legal action is being heard by the International 

Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an international tribunal 

housed at the World Bank that holds all of its meetings in secret.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Bechtel is demanding 

$25 million dollars from some of the poorest families in the world,&quot; said 

Oscar Olivera, a leader of the coalition of Bolivian peasants, workers and others 

that formed in opposition to Bechtel. &quot;The fact that a World Bank court is 

preparing to hear this case behind closed doors, without any public scrutiny or 

participation, is a clear example of how global economic rules are being rigged 

to benefit large corporations at the expense of everyone else.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A wide range of groups joined 

in the demand to open up the process. They include trade union organizations (e.g., 

the 2.5 million-member Canadian Labour Congress and Public Services International, 

which represents services sector workers around the world); environmental groups 

(e.g., Friends of the Earth); consumer organizations (e.g., consumers associations 

of Canada, Japan and Zambia and U.S.-based Public Citizen); research groups (e.g., 

Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, Transnational Institute in Amsterdam, 

and the Integrated Social Development Centre in Accra); and numerous religious 

institutions (e.g., Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers in Peru and the American Friends 

Service Committee); as well as noted authors Naomi Klein, Maude Barlow and Vandana 

Shiva. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The groups called on the 

panel to make all of the documents and meetings in the case public, to travel 

to Bolivia to receive public testimony, and to allow Bolivian civic leaders to 

be an equal party to the case. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The citizen's letter will 

be accompanied by a formal &quot;petition to participate&quot; by Olivera and 

other Bolivian civic leaders to the ICSID tribunal hearing the case. The tribunal 

is comprised of one member appointed by Bechtel, one appointed by the Bolivian 

government and a third, its president, appointed directly by World Bank President 

James Wolfensohn. The ICSID panel is scheduled to hold its first hearing sometime 

in early September (though Bank officials say they are barred from disclosing 

exactly when or where the hearing will take place).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The legal team representing 

the Bolivian petitioners includes Oakland, CA-based Earthjustice and the Washington, 

DC-based Center for International Environmental Law, both of which have been involved 

in attempts to intervene in similar investor-state lawsuits filed under the North 

American Free Trade Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFTERMATH OF A REVOLT AGAINST 

WATER PRICE HIKES</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the late 1990s the World 

Bank forced Bolivia to privatize the public water system of its third-largest 

city, Cochabamba, by threatening to withhold debt relief and other development 

assistance. In 1999, in a process with just one bidder, Bechtel, the California-based 

engineering giant, was granted a 40-year lease to take over Cochabamba's water, 

through a subsidiary the corporation formed for just that purpose (&quot;Aguas 

del Tunari&quot;).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within weeks of taking over 

the water system, Bechtel imposed huge rate hikes on local water users. Families 

living on the local minimum wage of $60 per month were given bills equal to as 

much as 25 percent of their monthly income. The rate hikes sparked massive citywide 

protests that the Bolivian government sought to end by declaring a state of martial 

law and the deployment of thousands of soldiers and police. More than a hundred 

people were injured and one 17-year-old boy was killed. In April 2000, as anti-Bechtel 

protests continued to grow, the company's managers abandoned the project. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bechtel filed the legal 

action against Bolivia last November, demanding compensation of $25 million, a 

figure that represents far more than Bechtel's investment in the few months it 

operated in Bolivia. Bechtel's action also aims to recoup a portion of the company's 

expected profits from the project. The company filed the case with ICSID under 

a bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and Bolivia. Although Bechtel 

is a U.S. corporation, it established a P.O. box presence in the Netherlands in 

order to make use of the treaty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rules in the Dutch-Bolivian 

treaty are similar to those in NAFTA and the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. 

According to Sarah Anderson, Director of the Global Economy Project at the Institute 

for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, &quot;There's been an outpouring of international 

support for the Bolivian petitioners in this case. So many people have become 

familiar with such investor-state lawsuits from the NAFTA experience and they 

see them as one of the most extreme examples of excessive power granted to corporations.&quot; 

According to Anderson, &quot;The Bechtel v Bolivia case could be a preview of 

what is to come if the FTAA is enacted. That agreement would give foreign investors 

throughout the hemisphere the right to sue governments directly over laws or regulations 

that might diminish their profits.&quot; </font></p>
