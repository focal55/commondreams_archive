<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">COLUMBUS, 
GEORGIA - July 13 - The front gate of Fort Benning was closed this morning by 
an autonomous activist who locked herself to the fence on Fort Benning Road underneath 
a sign that read, 'Lock up SOA/WHISC, Not Peacemakers!' The activist, Rebecca 
Johnson, 23, of Washington, DC was joined by a vigil of supporters who gathered 
in the permitted demonstration area. All were acting in solidarity with 37 human 
rights workers who were sentenced in Columbus, GA for their role in the SOA Watch 
November vigil and nonviolent resistance. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The entrance to Fort Benning was 'locked up' at 10:00 AM when Ms. 
Johnson closed the gates and chained herself to them. Many of the defendants attended 
the vigil, preparing for their sentences by calling attention to the atrocities 
committed by SOA graduates.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 'SOA 37' were among 10,000 who gathered last November to call 
for the closure of the notorious SOA/WHISC. The defendants peacefully crossed 
onto Ft. Benning, site of the school. Judge Faircloth is known for giving the 
maximum of six months to SOA/WHISC opponents. Seventy-one people have served a 
total of over forty years in prison for engaging in nonviolent resistance in a 
broad-based campaign to close the school. These defendants received sentences 
ranging from 6 months probation to 6 months in prison and a $5000 fine (see attached 
sheet).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'Those who speak out for justice are facing harsh prison sentences while 
SOA-trained torturers and assassins are operating with impunity,' said SOA 
Watch founder Fr. Roy Bourgeois. Ms. Johnson added, 'I am called to act for 
real change in US foreign policy towards Latin America. The SOA, under any name, 
teaches torturers, rapists, and murderers that the US will not divulge the secret 
of their crimes against humanity.'</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SOA/WHISC is a combat training school for Latin American soldiers. Its 
graduates are consistently involved in human rights abuses. In 1996 the Pentagon 
was forced to release training manuals used at the school that advocated the use 
of torture, extortion and execution. In December 2000 Congress authorized the 
WHISC to replace the SOA. The renaming of the school was widely viewed as an attempt 
to diffuse public criticism and to disassociate the school from its reputation. 
SOA Watch maintains that the underlying purpose of the school, to control the 
economic and political systems of Latin America by aiding and influencing Latin 
American militaries, remains the same.</font></p>
