<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- April 25 - 

 The battle to protect patients from the Justice Department's ongoing war against medical marijuana continued to gain momentum this week as Reps. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Albert Wynn (D-MD) signed on as co-sponsors of H.R. 2592, the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The measure, sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), would allow states to determine their own medical marijuana policies without federal interference.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Eight states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington -- have enacted measures legalizing the medical use of marijuana by patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, and other serious illnesses. Hawaii's law was passed by the state legislature in 2000, while voters enacted the seven other laws through ballot initiatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Across the country, public opinion surveys have consistently shown strong support for legal access to medical marijuana for the seriously ill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Canada has also authorized more than 800 patients to legally use marijuana for medical purposes, while in the Netherlands plans are moving forward to make medical marijuana available in pharmacies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     Although these state medical marijuana laws have successfully protected tens of thousands of patients from arrest, the federal government has been openly hostile to such efforts. Since last fall the Drug Enforcement Administration has conducted a series of raids against medical marijuana distribution centers that operated in cooperation with local authorities under the auspices of California's medical marijuana law, Proposition 215. On April 8, government attorneys continued to argue in federal court that the government has the right to forbid doctors from recommending marijuana to patients who might benefit from using it.</font></p>

<p>     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;During the 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush said that he thought the medical marijuana issue was one that states should be able to decide `as they so choose,' &quot; said Steve Fox, director of government relations for the Marijuana Policy Project. &quot;He has gone back on that promise, wasting law-enforcement resources trying to keep sick people from getting their medicine. And now he wants the government to interfere in doctor-patient relationships.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">     The Marijuana Policy Project works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have the approval of their doctors.</font></p>
