<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">COLMAN McCARTHY, <a href="mailto:colman1@earthlink.net">colman1@earthlink.net</a>, 

<a href="http://www.satyamag.com/nov01/mccarthy.html" target="_new">http://www.satyamag.com/nov01/mccarthy.html</a><br>

A former Washington Post columnist, McCarthy is founder and director of the 

Center for Teaching Peace in Washington, D.C. and the author of &quot;I'd Rather 

Teach Peace.&quot; He said today: &quot;I don't imagine that the meeting will lead to anything meaningful, because both Bush and the Pope believe in the 'just war' theory. The Papal comments on war are little more than cosmetic generalizations while the U.S. spends $900 million on the military every day. The Pope has yet to tell Catholics for example to stop giving their tax money to the Pentagon, in the way that he tells Catholics to oppose 

abortion and artificial birth control.... The current sex scandals in the 

Catholic Church are minor compared with the hierarchy's support for the 

U.S. government's war machine. Until Catholicism becomes a true peace 

church, like the Quakers, Mennonites, and Church of the Brethren, it mocks 

the nonviolence of early Christianity.&quot;</font></p>

General director of the International Center of Bethlehem and author of &quot;I 

Am a Palestinian Christian,&quot; Raheb (who is a Lutheran pastor) said

today: &quot;Israeli troops are still in Bethlehem. They seem to want to prove that 

they can come into Bethlehem anytime they want. They prevented people from 

taking refuge at the Church of the Nativity as happened before. People from 

the U.S. have come to help reconstruct the Church and the Center from the 

damage from the last Israeli invasion, but have not been able to get 

through because of the curfew. I don't expect much from the meeting between 

Bush and the Pope. We're fed up with meetings. Bush told Sharon to 

withdraw, he didn't for a long time, and now he has re-occupied Jenin and 

Hebron as well as Bethlehem. All these interim agreements have not gotten 

security for Israelis, peace for the region or justice for the Palestinians.&quot;</font></p>

Executive director of Benetvision: A Resource and Research Center for 

Contemporary Spirituality located in Erie, Penn., Chittister is author of &quot;In Search of Belief&quot; and &quot;The Story of Ruth: Twelve Moments in Every 

Woman's Life.&quot; She is a regular columnist for the National Catholic 

Reporter. Chittister said today: &quot;The moral chastisement has usually come 

from the Pope to the political leaders of the world, so it's understandable 

that the Vatican is upset about Bush raising [the subject of] the scandal. 

If the credibility of the Church is eroded from within, its social impact 

will be diminished. Bush recognizes that there was strong hierarchical 

support for him in the last election. If the Church's credibility is 

weakened, it stands to be a political loss as well as a moral one. While</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bush wants to focus on the role of the Church in the U.S., the Pope wants 

to focus on U.S. foreign and military policy.&quot;</font></p>
