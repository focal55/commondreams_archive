- May 15 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>GREG PALAST</b>, <a href="mailto:greg@gregpalast.com">greg@gregpalast.com</a>, <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com" target="_new">http://www.gregpalast.com</a> <br>

Palast is co-author of the forthcoming book &quot;Democracy and Regulation.&quot; He 

said today: &quot;The U.S. Senate is recoiling in phony shock and horror at the 

games Enron played to manipulate the California power market. The rip-offs, 

which Enron traders called 'Get Shorty,' 'Deathstar,' 'Fat Boy,' are simply 

variants on games Enron has been practicing in Britain for a decade, there 

known as 'stacking,' 'cramming,' and 'false scheduling.' None of this 

should come as a surprise to the U.S. Congress, which had full knowledge 

and warning about the ease of 'gaming' the power market when both parties 

voted to deregulate electricity prices in 1992. Rather than call for an end 

to the electricity deregulation con game, U.S. politicians continue to 

spread this failed experiment to other states, believing a 'fix' is 

possible.... Andersen's con is not new either. In 1989, it faced possible 

criminal charges over cooking the books for another power firm, Southern 

Company. I was on that investigation, but the first Bush's Justice 

Department let the power pirates off the hook, claiming that if Arthur 

Andersen audited their accounts, it must be fine.&quot;</font>

Professor of accountancy at Baruch College and author of &quot;Paper Prophets: A 

Social Critique of Accounting,&quot; Tinker said today: &quot;The imminent demise of 

Andersen should serve as a wake-up call. Instead, we are witnessing yet 

another chapter in short-termism, scapegoating, and bandage quick fixes. 

Does anyone believe that audit-for-rent practices were confined to 

Andersen? Champagne corks must be popping in the offices of the remaining 

Big Four accounting firms -- after the Andersen funeral service, the Big 

Four will have accomplished a degree of monopoly and concentration that, 

just a few years back, they had tendered in merger plans, and then hastily 

withdrew in the face of public outrage.... The Andersen/Enron affair has 

exposed a raft of conflicts of interest. To take one example from my own 

university business school, accounting teaching and research have been 

severely breached by the Big Five. University professors are dependent on 

their income-supplements through funded chairs and research grants. The 

American Accounting Association is itself in the big firms' financial pocket.&quot;</font></p>

<a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/utilities" target="_new">http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/utilities</a><br>

A consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 

Court said today: &quot;Our report, 'Hoax: How Deregulation Let the Power 

Industry Steal $71 Billion From California,' shows that California was not 

a victim of the laws of supply and demand, as it has been widely portrayed. 

The California energy crisis was a public relations hoax -- orchestrated by 

the power industry -- that will cost $2,200 for every Californian.... In 

the smoking gun memos uncovered earlier, Enron acknowledges that the 

manipulation of the market is standard practice. In fact, the power traders 

across the industry colluded in order to game the system. The Wall Street 

Journal reported that Dynegy -- another big Texas power company -- set up 

sham trades to make themselves look more of a market player than the 

company really was.... The lesson is that electricity should never again be 

left in the hands of unregulated, private corporations.&quot;</font></p>
