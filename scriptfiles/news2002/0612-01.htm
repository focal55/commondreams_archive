<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAINT 
LOUIS - June 11 - Twelve nonviolent protesters were arrested today when they took 
their message opposing Southern Baptist teachings against gay, lesbian, bisexual 
and transgender (GLBT) people to the floor of the SBC's annual meeting at the 
America's Center in St. Louis. An additional 38 people were arrested outside the 
America's Center trying to enter the Convention.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nonviolent protests 
were organized by Soulforce, an interfaith movement committed to ending spiritual 
violence perpetuated by religious policies and teachings against gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, and transgender people.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The action followed three 
years of efforts by Soulforce to discuss Southern Baptist policies and teachings 
which protestors believe lead to spiritual and physical violence against GLBT 
people.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For three years we 
have tried to get James Merritt to hear our stories, to consider the evidence 
that shows that homosexuality is not a sickness and not a sin,&quot; said Rev. 
Jimmy Creech, Chairperson of the Board of Soulforce, Inc, and one of the 12 arrested 
inside the convention center. &quot;Because of the suffering caused by their teachings, 
we were compelled to carry our message into the Southern Baptist Convention's 
annual meeting.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soulforce was present at 
the SBC's annual meetings in Orlando in 2000 and New Orleans in 2001 to protest 
their antigay policies and teachings. Soulforce participants were arrested at 
both those meetings as well. However, this marks the first time that Soulforce 
has participated in a direct action that took their message inside a meeting.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The twelve who were arrested 
inside the convention were booked on a felony charge of &quot;Ethnic Intimidation&quot; 
and a misdemeanor trespassing charge. The felony charge was dropped, and arrestees 
were allowed to go on their own recognizance. Those arrested on the outside were 
charged with 2 city ordinance violations, and released after a few hours. Bond 
was set at $200, and court cost will be added.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">200 Soulforce participants 
had lined the entrances to the America's Center and watched and cheered while 
the arrests were being made outside the convention. Many carried signs that said, 
&quot;Stop Spiritual Violence&quot;, and a banner that said, &quot;Southern Baptist 
Teachings are Killing God's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Children&quot; 
was prominently displayed for all those who were watching.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Soulforce co-founder and 
director Rev. Mel White sent Merritt a letter dated May 23 asking him to join 
Soulforce in a press conference to denounce the anti-gay rhetoric of Southern 
Baptist Chief Justice Roy Moore. The letter stated that Soulforce supporters would 
try to take the message that &quot;Southern Baptist teachings are killing God's 
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender children&quot; inside the convention center 
if Merritt would not denounce Moore's rhetoric.</font></p>
