Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Weisbrot wrote the 

article "Economists in Denial" in today's <i>Washington Post</i>. He said this 

afternoon: "[Treasury Secretary Paul] O'Neill is visiting countries in the grip 

of serious economic and financial crisis: Argentina's economy has collapsed, and 

Brazil is headed toward default on its debt. And this comes at the end of a long 

period of economic failure: over the last 20 years, the income of the average 

Latin American has barely grown -- by 7 percent -- as compared to 75 percent growth 

over the previous 20 years (1960-1980). In the United States, the failure has 

been distributional: despite considerable economic growth, the median wage here 

is barely above what it was 29 years ago. Granting fast-track authority to pursue 

more of the same polices is not going to help. It is time for policy-makers to 

ask some serious questions about what has gone wrong."</p> </font>

The front page of today's <i>Wall Street Journal</i> features an article headlined: 

"Enron Criminal Probe Focuses on Alleged Corruption Abroad." The piece cites Wysham, 

a fellow with the Institute for Policy Studies and author of "Enron's Pawns: How 

Public Institutions Bankrolled Enron's Globalization Game." As detailed in the 

article, the Justice Department's previously undisclosed inquiry into possible 

violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by Enron examines Enron's efforts 

to win foreign pipeline, power and water-privatization projects, some reaching 

as far back as the mid-1990s. Although Enron has declared bankruptcy for its domestic 

operations, much of its overseas operations remain intact, thanks to long-term 

financial backing from U.S. taxpayer-financed institutions, such as the Overseas 

Private Investment Corporation, the World Bank, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and 

the Inter-American Development Bank. Wysham said this afternoon: "These public 

agencies still have not been held accountable for their roles in Enron's continued 

activity abroad, which is the real scandal here. In this era of globalization, 

public agencies are selling out public resources for the private gain of CEOs 

and their collaborators. Bribery and other forms of corruption and coercion are 

the rule, not the exception, in many development projects abroad. Enron is not 

just one rotten apple; the whole barrel of government-corporate collusion in development 

contracts is rotten, and is forcing developing countries to accept deals that 

are not in their, or our, long-term interest."</p> </font>

George W. Bush spoke at a celebration of the miners' rescue in Pennsylvania today. 

Roberts, international president of the United Mine Workers of America, pointed 

out a number of policies the administration has pursued that are harmful to the 

well-being of miners.</p> </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
