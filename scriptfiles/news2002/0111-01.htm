<p>This event is part of a day of coordinated international actions to end the 

war on Iraq.



<p>. The September 11th attacks took the lives of about 3,300 innocent

civilians. Multiplying that terrible loss by 300 gives the number of

innocent Iraqi civilians, mostly children, killed by eleven years of

U.S.-led bombing and sanctions.



<p>. On January 16, 1991, the United States attacked Iraq after refusing to

discuss a negotiated withdrawal from Kuwait despite Iraqi willingness to do 

so. In six weeks of intensive bombing, an estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers 

and 100,000 civilians were killed and the country's civilian infrastructure, 

including water purification, sewage treatment and electrical plants were 

destroyed.



<p>. Since August, 1999, Iraq has been the victim of one of the most severe

economic blockades against any nation. Without the ability to import spare 

parts, medicines and even chlorine, more than one million Iraqis have died.  

Ongoing attacks by U.S. & British war planes have killed hundreds more.



<p>. The so-called "war on terrorism", which has already claimed thousands of 

innocent lives in Afghanistan, is really a continuation of the same brutal 

U.S. Foreign and military policies in which non-American human beings are 

regarded as expendable in the protection of U.S. interests.   It is this 

kind of foreign policy which gives rise to deep and understandable 

resentment around the world and which needs to change.



<p>Partial list of co-sponsors: Sacramento Coalition to End the War on Iraq; 

Davis Coalition to End the Sanctions Against Iraq; Sacramento-Yolo Peace 

Action; Sacramento Pax Christi;  Grandmothers for Peace; School of the 

Americas Watch; American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee; Sacramento Area 

Call for Peace; Sacramento Valley Labor Committee for Peace & Justice
