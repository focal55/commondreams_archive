Secretary Spencer Abraham recommended that President Bush 

designate Yucca Mountain as the repository for some 77,000 tons 

of high-level nuclear waste. Although the DOE claims that the 

area is "scientifically sound and suitable," there is little 

evidence to support this finding, which is bitterly opposed by 

Nevada residents, local and state legislators, and environment 

and health public interest groups. 



<p>The nuclear industry has long pressed for the transportation 

of nuclear waste from commercial facilities and other sites to 

Yucca Mountain. This would allow current and new nuclear power 

stations to go on producing radioactive waste without regard for 

the environmental consequences. 



<p>"There is credible scientific evidence that harmful 

radiation from Yucca Mountain could contaminate the aquifer that 

supplies drinking water for Las Vegas and Los Angeles," said 

Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H., Executive Director and CEO of 

Physicians for Social Responsibility. "Secretary Abraham has 

arrived at this decision under pressure from big energy 

corporation campaign donors." 



<p>The Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear 

Regulatory Commission have eased regulations proposed for 

controlling the site more than once, as tests showed that Yucca 

Mountain could not meet normal standards for protecting public 

health and the environment. Leaks from the site could well 

contaminate the freshwater aquifer located beneath Yucca 

Mountain. This aquifer is the only source of drinking water for 

the residents of Las Vegas, Nevada and surrounding areas. It 

also supplies drinking water for southern California. 



<p>"The science is simply not there to support this decision", 

said Jaya Tiwari, Director of Research for the PSR Center for 

Global Security and Health. "The rush to choose Yucca Mountain 

could endanger public health for a thousand generations." 



<p>Worse, the waste that will be sent to Yucca in as many as 

50,000 shipments is comprised of highly radioactive material 

from U.S commercial nuclear reactors and atomic weapons 

facilities spread out across 31 states. 90 percent of the waste 

would travel via train or truck from east of the Mississippi 

River. This presents a high risk of accident and, in the current 

climate, a major terrorist threat. 



<p>"Any one of these shipments could be hijacked by terrorists 

and exploded as a 'dirty bomb', spreading nuclear fallout across 

the center of an American city," said Martin Butcher, Director 

of Security Programs for PSR. "The proliferation dangers of this 

decision are staggering, Secretary Abraham is giving terrorists 

50,000 chances to wage war with a weapon of mass destruction."
