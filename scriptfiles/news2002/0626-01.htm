<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 26 - News 
Advisory: </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What:</b> Press conference 
set for Monday, July 1 to mark return from delegations to Afghanistan, Pakistan 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key leaders of Pax Christi 
USA will speak at a press conference in the nation's capital to report on their 
findings following delegations to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Central to their report 
is the assumption of many in the region that the Bush administration is driven 
by its interest in capturing Osama bin-Laden and destroying the Al-Quaeda terrorist 
network, but its commitment to promoting peace and stability in countries like 
Afghanistan and Pakistan is highly questionable. Marie Dennis, vice-president 
of Pax Christi International, stated that the criticism of US policy in the region 
was not particularly focused on the US bombing campaign in Afghanistan, &quot;but 
on the inconsistency, 'ad-hoc-ness,' and shallow self-interest that led the US 
to repeatedly renege on commitments to South Asia and fail to play the positive 
leadership role required by its super power status.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dennis was joined by Dave 
Robinson, national coordinator of Pax Christi USA, and Bishop Thomas Gumbleton 
of the Archdiocese of Detroit, on an interfaith delegation to Afghanistan organized 
by Global Exchange, a national human-rights organization. Prior to the Afghan 
delegation -- which concludes on June 29 -- Dennis and Robinson were on a delegation 
to Pakistan during its nuclear stand-off with India. The delegation was organized 
by Pax Christi USA and hosted by Caritas Internationalis, an international Catholic 
relief organization. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The delegations to both 
countries included meetings with Muslim and Christian religious leaders, including 
Bishop Joseph Coutts of Faisalabad, Pakistan. The delegations met with international 
relief agencies, political and economic organizations, and Afghani families who 
lost loved ones in the US-led bombing campaign. Goals of the delegations included 
building bridges between faith communities in the US and in Afghanistan and Pakistan; 
gauging the impact of the war on terrorism in the region, including its impact 
on the confrontation between India and Pakistan; and ascertaining the status of 
Christians in Pakistan. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The press conference is 
Monday, July 1, 10 a.m. in the Murrow Room of the National Press Club. </font></p>

Zokovitch, 352-219-8419. </font></p>
