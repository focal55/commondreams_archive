- July 19 - The following is a statement of Reverend Carlton W. Veazey, president, 

Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice: </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religions have varying views about 

the beginning of life and of personhood that lead to different beliefs about the 

permissibility of abortion -- beliefs that are grounded in theology, not science. 

It is for this reason that the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice holds 

that secular laws regarding abortion are unconstitutional if they impose a religious 

viewpoint or require adherence to a religious belief. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This concern for protecting freedom 

of conscience and religious freedom causes us to question the nomination of Texas 

Supreme Court Associate Justice Priscilla Owen for a position on the 5th U.S. 

District Court of Appeals. Justice Owen has consistently ruled against reproductive 

choice since coming to the Texas Supreme Court in 1995. As an alliance of faith 

groups, our particular concern relates to the case Jane Doe 1 (Texas 2000), in 

which Justice Owen wrote that she would impose a religious counseling requirement 

that had not been approved by the Texas legislature before recognizing the right 

to an abortion in a judicial bypass case. A hearing on Owen's nomination is scheduled 

for Tuesday, July 23. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Jane Doe 1, Justice Owen questioned 

whether Doe, a college-bound senior who had received information about her options 

from friends, family, a parenting teacher, and Planned Parenthood, was aware of 

the religious implications of abortion, despite the fact that the law in no way 

involves religious considerations. She wrote: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I would require a minor to 

demonstrate that she has sought and obtained meaningful counseling from a qualified 

source about the emotional and psychological impact she may experience now and 

later in her life as a result of having an abortion.... She should also indicate 

to the court that she is aware of and has considered that there are philosophic, 

social, moral and religious arguments that can be brought to bear when considering 

abortion.... (R)equiring a minor to exhibit an awareness that there are issues, 

including religious ones, (that) surround the abortion decision is not prohibited 

by the Establishment Clause.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justice Owen would also rewrite the 

criterion allowing judicial bypass if notification would not be in the minor's 

best interest. Owen wrote that she would add a requirement that &quot;a court 

find... by a preponderance of the evidence that an abortion is in the best interest 

of the minor.&quot; Owen did not state what evidence other than a woman's personal 

choice should be relevant to this question but her statement on counseling requirements 

raises the possibility that she would favor an unconstitutional religious test. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the Coalition's founding in 

1973, our purpose has been to safeguard the ability of women to make reproductive 

decisions according to their beliefs and conscience, without governmental interference 

or imposition or religious tests. The nomination of Justice Owen is inconsistent 

with this purpose. </font></p>

for Reproductive Choice is the national alliance of 38 organizations from 16 denominations
