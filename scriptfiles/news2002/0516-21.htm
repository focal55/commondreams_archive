<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What:</b>  Press conference with peace workers recently returned from the West Bank who delivered humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the Church of the Nativity and President Arafat's besieged Ramallah compound. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Who:</b> <br>

<b>Adam Shapiro, International Solidarity Movement</b><br>

Adam Shapiro has lived in Jerusalem and Ramallah for over 2 1/2 years, first working for Seeds of Peace as the Director of the Center for Coexistence in Jerusalem. Mr. Shapiro has earned an MA in Politics from New York University and an MA in Arab Studies from Georgetown University. Most recently, Mr.Shapiro helped organize humanitarian aid and worked with medical relief organizations in Ramallah and other Palestinian cities, and negotiated the first ambulance to be allowed entry into the Presidential Compound (Muqata'a) in Ramallah after the Israeli siege began.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>George Rishmawi, Palestinian Center for Rapprochement, Bethlehem</b> George Rishmawi, from Bethlehem, works for the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between people, a Palestinian NGO dedicated to pursuing peace and justice for the Palestinian people through non-violent means. He has played a vital role in organizing International Solidarity Movement delegations in Palestine.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Kristen Schurr, Free Speech Radio</b><br>

Kristen Schurr, from New York City, is a journalist with Free Speech Radio and Democracy Now. She was recently deported by Israel for delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. She was in the Church for the last ten days of the standoff.</font></p>

<p> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rebecca Murray, Direct Action for a Free Palestine</b><br>

Rebecca Murray, 31, is a New York City resident and works in film production. She has just returned from her second trip to Palestine, where she was part of an international presence in Yasser Arafat's besieged Ramallah compound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Why:</b>  The International Solidarity Movement is a Palestinian-led network of individual activists and grassroots community organizations dedicated to using nonviolence to struggle against Israeli occupation and for Palestinian freedom. Since May 2001, activists with the ISM have participated in a number of nonviolent direct action campaigns, including removing roadblocks, rebuilding destroyed homes and replanting uprooted trees, among other actions and protests.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an attempt to remove all witnesses from its violent strikes against Palestinian communities, the Israeli government is in the process of deporting all of the peace workers who attempted to or succeed in delivering humanitarian aid to the Church of the Nativity during the 39-day standoff. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the embassies of peace workers from Britain, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark intervened to have their citizens released, several Americans continue to be held in Ramle prison - a prison notorious for its human rights abuses, especially those against women and children. The US embassy has consistently refused to help these U.S. citizens and has attempted to force their parents to pay their deportation costs, despite the fact that each of them already has a return ticket. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Americans have not been charged with any crime. Their detention comes at the height of international humanitarian efforts to deliver food and water to besieged Palestinian civilians. To protest their illegal detention, the Americans have been on hunger strike for over a week (one man, Seattle native Trevor Baumgartner, for two weeks), and have been refusing water for most, if not all, of the last 6 days. </font></p>
