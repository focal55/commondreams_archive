- April 24 - 

The Sierra Club tomorrow will launch radio ads in seven states, thanking Senators who voted to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling and urging them to support a cleaner, cheaper and safer energy policy.  Unfortunately, while the Senate energy bill does not open the Refuge for oil drilling, that wilderness could be opened for drilling when the House and Senate versions of the bill are combined later this year.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ad also asks Senators to keep Arctic oil drilling out of the House and Senate compromise energy bill. The radio ads will run in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and South Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While we applaud the Senate for this victory on the Arctic Refuge, the fight is not over yet,&quot; said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.  &quot;The oil industry isn't finished with its attempt to destroy this natural treasure.  The public said they want the Arctic Refuge protected for future generations, and their Senators heard them loud and clear. Americans know that drilling the Arctic Refuge will do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  We hope Senators will continue to ward off the oil industry when the Senate and House bills are reconciled later this year.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, the Senate voted 54 to 46 against allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  However, the House of Representatives included a drilling provision in their version of the legislation.  This discrepancy will have to be reconciled in a conference committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arctic drilling would do virtually nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil or increase our national security. Government estimates indicate that there is less than a six month supply of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and even the oil industry admits it would take ten years to make it to U.S. markets.  Rather than drilling this national treasure, the single biggest step we can take to reduce our dependence on oil is to make our cars, light trucks and SUVs go farther on a gallon of gas.</font></p>

&quot;No Singing Yet&quot; -- Colorado<br>

April 22, 2002</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The musk ox survived the ice age,

being hunted to near-extinction

and now a vote in the U.S. Senate

that would have allowed the oil industry to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</i></font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No thanks to Senators Wayne Allard and Ben Nighthorse Campbell -- who caved to pressure from the big oil companies and voted to allow drilling that threatens musk ox, polar bears, and caribou, drilling that will never lead us to energy independence.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the Refuge isn't safe yet and Senator Allard and Senator Campbell could still do the right thing.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Call them at 202-224-3121.<br>

Ask them: to keep oil drilling out of the House and Senate compromise bill... to protect the Rocky Mountains and other wild places the Bush administration has targeted for drilling... and to support energy policies that provide cheaper, cleaner, safer energy solutions for our families, for our future.</font></i></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paid for by the Rocky Mountain Chapter of Sierra Club.</font></i></p>
