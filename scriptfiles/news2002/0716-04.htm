YORK - July 16 - Though the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IAHCR) 
has decided in Lori Berenson's favor, justice will continue to be delayed for 
the North American human rights activist and freelance journalist who has been 
wrongfully incarcerated for more than six-and-a-half years. As hoped and anticipated, 
the IACHR, part of the Organization of American States (OAS) has vindicated Ms. 
Berenson. After thoroughly reviewing her petition and holding public hearings, 
the Inter-American Commission, which is comprised of seven internationally recognized 
scholars from OAS member nations, ruled that Lori Berenson is being wrongfully 
held. Unfortunately, the government of Peru has decided to appeal this decision 
to the OAS Inter-American Court of Human Rights and, while awaiting vindication 
by this court Lori Berenson will remain in prison, possibly two more years, as 
the appeal runs its course.<br>
<br>
The decision to not comply with the ruling of the IACHR indicates that Peru is 
unwilling to reform its laws ang legal system. This will surely bring further 
condemnation from the international human rights community. Peru's action can 
only be construed as support for the illegal statutes instituted by the now disgraced 
former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori, and enforced by Vladimiro Montesinos.<br>
<br>
For nearly seven years Lori Berenson has proclaimed her innocence. She is presently 
in Huacariz prison in the northern Andean city of Cajamarca. She suffers from 
the harsh effects of her years in inhumane Peruvian prisons. Peru's decision to 
appeal means that the must suffer yet longer as she awaits the decision for the 
Inter-American Court that will finally free her.<br>
<br>
The Committee to Free Lori Berenson (CFLB) urges the government of Peru to demonstrate 
that it is among the community of nations that supports human rights by accepting 
the IAHCR ruling. We ask all who agree to write to Peruvian president Alejandro 
Toledo and urge him to end Lori's cruel, illegal imprisonment now. We also ask 
all to contact President Bush and remind him that he is obligated by Us statute 
(Article 22/USC/section1732) to come to the rescue of a citizen wrongfully held 
abroad. Lori Berenson is Wrongfully held in Peru and President Bush must do everything 
in his power to bring her home.<br>
