Additional public events are scheduled with Felipa Awardees May 10 in San Francisco, and May 13 and 14 in New York (see at the bottom of this release for more details).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Felipa Awards are a special time for me and for the organization,&quot; commented Surina Khan, IGLHRC's Executive Director. &quot;These awards give us the opportunity to honor truly inspiring activists, who are the backbone of our work. Their integrity and dedication are inspiring to us all.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marta Luc&iacute;a Tamayo Rinc&oacute;n, a Colombian feminist lawyer, was present to receive an award for herself and on behalf of two lesbians in prison whom she represents: Marta Luc&iacute;a &Aacute;lvarez Giraldo, and Alba Nelly Montoya.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Prison conditions are a mirror of social conditions and reflect in a dramatic way the controls that societies exercise over women's bodies, and especially those who are lesbian or display lesbian behavior,&quot; stated Ms. Tamayo. &quot;The Felipa Awards may represent an opportunity for many people to understand that although people in prison, especially women, may have had their rights restricted, they have not ceased to be human beings. People in prison must continue to enjoy basic rights so that their human dignity is not violated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a note sent from prison, Ms. &Aacute;lvarez stated: &quot;There are women in Latin America ready to face the consequences so as to achieve dignity for those of us who feel and love differently.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This award was introduced by Kate Kendell, executive Director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. For full bio of Ms. Tamayo, see <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_Martas.html" target="_new">http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_Martas.html</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cui Zi En, an openly gay Chinese writer and film director commented on the difficulties he faced to be able to be present and receive his award. The U.S. Consulate in Beijing first denied and then granted his visa so late, that he was only able to come to San Francisco a mere 10 hours before the ceremony started.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Maybe the U.S. thought I would come here and bring you all with me to China,&quot; he joked. On a serious note, he thanked other Chinese gay activists for opening new spaces for gay and lesbians in China and stated that &quot;a new gay culture is developing through our own endeavor.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This award was introduced by Guo-Juin Hong, Professor of Film Studies at U.C. Berkeley. For full bio of Mr. Cui, see <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_ZiEn.html" target="_new">http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_ZiEn.html</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maher Sabry, an Egyptian activist fighting against police abuse, arrest and torture of gay men, was also present to receive his award. He noted that this coming weekend would be the anniversary of the mass arrests of suspected homosexuals in the Queen Boat in Cairo Egypt. Out of the 52 men tried in an Emergency Court, 23 are still serving hard labor sentences.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I ask you that keep up the pressure with the Egyptian government,&quot; he stated. &quot;The harassment, the arrests, and the unfair convictions of suspected homosexuals continue to happen today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This award was introduced by Lina Baroudi, an activist with Southwest Asian/North African Bay Area Queers (SWANABAQ) and Arab Women's Solidarity. For a full bio of Mr. Sabry, see <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_Maher.html" target="_new">http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_Maher.html</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A posthumous award was given to honor the life and work of Brazilian lesbian activist Elizabeth Calvet. Alejandra Sard&aacute;, IGLHRC's Program Coordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean highlighted her love of life and her contributions to the lesbian and black movements in Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot; As we honor her memory tonight, let us open ourselves to the qualities that made her unique and constitute her legacy: let us open ourselves to integrity, to dance, to rebelliousness,&quot; declared Ms. Sard&aacute;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a full bio of Ms. Calvet, see <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_Elizabeth.html" target="_new">http://www.iglhrc.org/felipa/2002_Elizabeth.html</a>.</font></p>
