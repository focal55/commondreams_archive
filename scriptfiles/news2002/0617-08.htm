- June 17 - Today's Supreme Court decision striking down an Ohio city ordinance 
regulating door-to-door advocacy is a victory for religious freedom, according 
to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Stratton, Ohio, ordinance required anyone wishing to engage in door-to-door 
advocacy to register with the city government and fill out a form giving detailed 
information about their activities. Eight justices agreed that the law was too 
broad. (The lone dissenter was Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;People who want to talk about their views with others shouldn&#8217;t 
have to ask the government for permission first,&#8221; said the Rev. Barry W. 
Lynn, Americans United executive director. &#8220;The First Amendment protects 
the right of Americans to spread their views. Whether it's the Jehovah's Witnesses 
asking people to join their denomination or an atheist group asking people to 
reject religion, Americans shouldn't have to get a permit from the government 
to spread their opinions.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continued Lynn, &quot;People who are bothered by door-to-door evangelism can 
always say, 'No, thanks' and shut the door or post a 'No soliciting' sign. Heavy-handed 
government regulations on speech stifle our basic freedoms.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The challenge to Stratton&#8217;s law was brought by the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, 
a denomination known for its public outreach. The case is Watchtower Bible and 
Tract Society of New York v. Village of Stratton.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority, &quot;It is offensive -- 
not only to the values protected by the First Amendment, but to the very notion 
of a free society -- that in the context of everyday public discourse a citizen 
must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then 
obtain a permit to do so.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Americans United is a 
religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. Founded in 1947, the 
organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation 
in safeguarding religious freedom. </i></font></p>
