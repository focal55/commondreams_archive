- August 15 - World Wildlife Fund today

called on the United States to lead in new global efforts to

improve access to clean water, energy efficiency and renewable

technology. The call to action comes as world leaders are preparing

for the Earth Summit to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa from

August 26 through September 4. The Summit will be the largest

environmental meeting since the Rio Earth Summit 10 years ago.

<p>"WWF believes that President Bush's efforts to get the nations

of the world to help us solve the problem of terror will be greatly

strengthened if he is seen leading an equally broad coalition to

better the environmental and economic conditions under which

billions of the world's people continue to live," states Brooks

Yeager, WWF's vice president for global threats.

<p>"Over one and one half billion people lack ready access to clean

drinking water. Since the Rio Summit in 1992, the world's energy

consumption has increased by 10 percent. The United States spends

less than one-tenth of one percent of its gross national product

helping other countries better their living conditions and protect

their environment. Clearly the billions of dissatisfied people out

here are contributing to the part of the problem of instability in

the world we face today," continued Yeager.

<p>Yeager, who will lead World Wildlife Fund's delegation to the

Earth Summit, summarized WWF's goals for the Summit: "We want a

global commitment to accelerate the adoption of energy efficiency

and renewable technologies in the developing world. We want a

commitment to improve the access to safe drinking water for

billions of the world's poor people, including protecting the

watersheds and developing sanitation technologies that are

necessary to have clean water in countries. We clearly want rules

to develop that will ensure accelerating trade and globalization

which is fair and environmentally sensitive, and we want a

commitment of resources from a developed countries, including the

United States that will enable that progress to happen."
