- September 5 - More than one thousand calls are placed to state public health 

officials each year regarding suspected clusters of diseases ranging from childhood 

leukemia to multiple sclerosis. But disease cluster investigations are often delayed 

or deterred because most states lack adequate tracking for chronic diseases, according 

to a report released today by U.S. PIRG, a public interest advocacy organization. 

At the same time, some cluster investigations are aided by the presence of good 

information on disease and environmental exposures.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Few situations are 

as troubling as rising rates of cancer or birth defects in a community. Poor or 

nonexistent tracking of disease rates and environmental exposures means that communities 

can't get questions answered and health problems addressed,&quot; said Jeremiah 

Baumann, environmental health advocate with U.S. PIRG. &quot;Good environmental 

health tracking can help communities address disease clusters.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report highlights 14 

communities affected by disease clusters. While notoriously difficult even under 

the best of circumstances, disease cluster investigations play an important role 

in protecting health. Investigations help public health officials target resources 

for disease prevention and treatment, spur the discovery and cleanup of environmental 

pollution, and enable researchers to identify links between environmental exposures 

and chronic disease.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The difficulty of investigating 

disease clusters is often exacerbated by incomplete, out-of-date, or entirely 

absent information on disease rates and environmental exposures. While most states 

have cancer registries, the registries sometimes don't meet national standards. 

More than half of the states recently received a grade of 'C' or lower for their 

birth defects monitoring programs from the Trust for America's Health, a public 

health advocacy organization.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only three states-California, 

Iowa, and Massachusetts-have both cancer and birth defects registries that meet 

the highest standards of quality and also have systems for tracking asthma. Almost 

no states conduct systematic tracking of neuro-developmental disorders such as 

multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's, metabolic diseases like diabetes, 

or autoimmune disorders such as lupus. According to 1998 study by a researcher 

at the University of Missouri, thirty-seven states have less than one full-time 

person available to handle cancer cluster concerns.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the U.S. PIRG 

report, the lack of adequate information on disease rates and environmental exposures 

hinders investigations in several ways: missing information delays investigations; 

it prevents health officials from identifying disease trends; it reduces the number 

of clusters investigated, leaving many clusters uninvestigated; and it deters 

communities from getting the information and help they need when a suspected cluster 

arises.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report highlights fourteen 

case studies of cluster investigations. Several of the cases, including a childhood 

leukemia cluster in Toms River, N.J., a multiple sclerosis cluster in El Paso, 

Texas, and a cluster of cleft lip cases in Dickson County, Tenn., show investigations 

delayed or otherwise hindered by inadequate or missing disease tracking information. 

Missing information on environmental exposures hindered investigations of cancer 

clusters in Hazleton, Penn., and Calcasieu Parish, La.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, aggressive monitoring 

of birth defects in Laredo, Texas, caught an emerging cluster and led to proactive 

public health intervention, and active surveillance for breast cancer in New York 

provoked an investigation into the role of environmental factors in breast cancer 

rates on Long Island. The California Birth Defects Monitoring System has enabled 

researchers to correlate maternal exposure to air pollution and residence within 

a quarter-mile of a Superfund toxic waste site with the development of certain 

birth defects.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention (CDC) is initiating a nationwide environmental health tracking 

project to set up consistent disease and exposure tracking across the country, 

starting this fall with pilot projects in a handful of states. This month, the 

House of Representatives will consider whether to increase funding for the program 

so that it can extend to all fifty states.</font></p>
