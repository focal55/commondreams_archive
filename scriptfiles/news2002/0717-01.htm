<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- July 17 - Health &amp; Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson launched a so-called 
&quot;anti-obesity&quot; program today for youth that will be implemented by the 
very interests that are pushing fatty foods and couch potato habits at the nation's 
kids.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The program involves a &quot;partnership&quot; between the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) and elements of the &quot;obesity lobby,&quot; including 
corporations such as the Publicis Groupe advertising agencies, AOL Time Warner, 
Viacom and Primedia.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CDC selected the Publicis Groupe's Frankel as the &quot;lead agency&quot; 
for its anti-obesity advertising campaign. Frankel also advertises for McDonalds. 
&quot;This is like asking Jeffrey Skilling to head up the President's new Corporate 
Fraud Task Force,&quot; said Gary Ruskin, executive director of Commercial Alert.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AOL Time Warner, Viacom &amp; Primedia all have TV stations that promote junk 
food to children and teenagers, and encourage them to watch TV and play video 
games instead of exercising. &quot;If these companies were really serious about 
doing something about childhood obesity they would stop doing these things. They 
would not seek to corral the time of children. They would not pitch junk food,&quot; 
Ruskin said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On top of this, the CDC program is going to spend $2.8 million this school 
year on advertising to children on Channel One. Channel One is an ad vehicle disguised 
as a news show that pitches junk food and soda pop to kids in the nation's classrooms. 
Channel One, which is owned by Primedia, has been foundering in recent years. 
&quot;This new partnership will serve to prop up a prime propaganda vehicle for 
the obesity lobby,&quot; Ruskin said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commercial Alert sent letters today to three key Members of Congress, requesting 
them to investigate requesting them to investigate this connection.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In April, 2002, Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is the majority 
owner of Primedia, gave $250,000 in soft money to the Republican National Committee, 
according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Jack Abramoff, a top Republican 
lobbyist and fundraiser, is Channel One's Washington lobbyist.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Could this be a political payoff to help out a major Republican soft 
money donor and fundraiser?&quot; the letters ask. &quot;If Secretary Thompson 
were serious about fighting obesity, he would encourage our nation's schools to 
ban Channel One, instead of providing it with legitimacy and advertising revenues.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The requests for investigation were sent to Senator Joe Lieberman, Chairman 
of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs; Senator Edward Kennedy, Chairman 
of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions; and Representative 
Henry Waxman, ranking member of the House Committee on Government Reform.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commercial Alert also sent a letter today to Secretary Thompson, asking him 
whether he would ask media companies and advertising agencies, as a condition 
of receipt of CDC funds, to refuse to produce or show ads for high-added-fat, 
high-added-sugar foods such as soda pop, junk food and fast food.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last week, President Bush said &quot;There's no capitalism without conscience; 
there is no wealth without character.&quot; &quot;Media companies and ad agencies 
ought to have the character to stop pushing junk food at our nation's kids,&quot; 
Ruskin said. &quot;And Secretary Thompson ought to have the character to ask them 
to do so.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May, Commercial Alert and a coalition of consumer and public health organizations 
and advocates sent a letter to Secretary Tommy Thompson asking him to support 
a World Health Organization initiative to curtail the marketing of junk food, 
and prevent obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He did not respond.</font></p>
