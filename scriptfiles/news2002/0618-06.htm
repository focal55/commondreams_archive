YORK - June 18 - Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the non-profit consumer 
group Center for Justice &amp; Democracy, called the American Medical Association 
a &#8220;shameful organization that has chosen to lie down with a profiteering 
and corrupt insurance industry instead of protecting patients.&#8221; Doroshow 
said, &#8220;The AMA yesterday issued a so-called &#8216;study&#8217; -- mainly 
a survey of state medical societies -- intended to hype its campaign to restrict 
patients&#8217; rights to sue malpracticing doctors and hospitals, arguing that 
tort laws are forcing insurers to price-gouge doctors. This is despite the conclusions 
of every credible, independent body which has studied this issue, finding that 
interest rates, the economy and the economic cycle of the insurance industry are 
the cause of severe sudden rate increases for doctors, irrespective of tort limits 
imposed in a particular state.&#8221; </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, said Doroshow, &#8220;The AMA has the nerve to argue that only a 
handful of states have enacted severe tort restrictions in medical malpractice 
cases and only these states, like California, are not experiencing an insurance 
crisis. This is completely false. Some 46 states enacted often severe restrictions 
on patients&#8217; rights in the mid-1980s, after being told by lobbyists that 
such laws would bring down rates. They did not work, which is why we are in this 
situation today.&#8221; The full list can be found at http://centerjd.org/free/Medmallist.pdf. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Enactment of laws that restrict injured patients&#8217; rights to go 
to court have not lowered insurance costs or rates,&#8221; said Doroshow. &#8220;The 
Center for Justice &amp; Democracy issued the definitive study on this topic in 
1999 -- two years before the current &#8216;crisis&#8217; hit. Premium Deceit 
-- the Failure of &#8220;Tort Reform&#8221; to Cut Insurance Prices was the first-ever 
look at 14 years of insurance price trends in every state plus the District of 
Columbia. The study found that over this period, states with little or no tort 
law restrictions experienced approximately the same changes in insurance rates 
as those states that have enacted severe restrictions on victims&#8217; rights.&#8221; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In direct response to Premium Deceit at the time of its release, Sherman Joyce, 
president of the American Tort Reform Association, said, &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t 
tell you or anyone that the reason to pass tort reform would be to reduce insurance 
rates.&#8221; (Liability Week, July 19, 1999). ATRA&#8217;s general counsel, Victor 
Schwartz, said, &#8220;[M]any tort reform advocates do not contend that restricting 
litigation will lower insurance rates, and &#8216;I&#8217;ve never said that in 
30 years.&#8217;&#8221; (Liability Week, July 19, 1999). And this year, the American 
Insurance Association said, &#8220;Insurers never promised that tort reform would 
achieve specific premium savings.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Doroshow, &#8220; &#8216;Tort reform&#8217; has failed and will 
fail again to reduce rates, let alone having terrible consequences for many innocent 
people.&#8221; </font></p>
