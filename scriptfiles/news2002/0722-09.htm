<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOSTON - July 22 -At a congressional 

hearing in Boston today, a Boston University School of Public Health professor 

unveiled a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug plan that employs new cost-cutting 

and financing methods to make it affordable for both patients and the federal 

treasury.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alan Sager, Ph.D., director 

of the Health Reform Program at BU's School of Public Health, outlined the new 

plan that would cover all drugs, with modest co-payments of $5 or $10 per prescription. 

It would hold new federal costs below $400 billion through 2011, yet protect drug 

makers' current profit levels and ability to finance research.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With comprehensive drug 

coverage, Medicare patients could fill many prescriptions that they are currently 

unable to afford. Manufacturing the added volume of pills would cost far less 

than today's prices. Instead of paying high list prices, Medicare would cover 

drug makers' actual cost of manufacturing the increased volume of pills. Sager 

estimates this measure would save over $400 billion in 10 years. &quot;Drug manufacturers 

would not earn windfall profits on the higher volume, but their profits would 

not fall either,&quot; he says.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sager proposes launching 

a federal effort to develop and distribute reliable evidence on drug effectiveness, 

safety and cost. This would encourage quick adoption of breakthrough drugs and 

discourage use of costly drugs that lack added benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;With drug makers' 

profits protected, they would not need to waste a projected $410 billion on marketing 

and advertising over the next ten years,&quot; says Sager. Re-directing that money 

would help finance both the drug coverage and the new drug information initiative. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Premiums would typically 

run about $20 per month, on a sliding scale based on individuals' Social Security 

checks. Patients' only costs would be premiums and co-payments, and both would 

be scaled to income.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Patients are not forced 

to choose among costly and inadequate benefit packages,&quot; says Sager. &quot;Instead, 

they would pay little for one benefit package that offers freedom of choice of 

all medications.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sager notes that the Department 

of Veterans Affairs' experience with prescription drug purchasing has shown that 

winning lower prices is a far more effective way to contain cost than is restricting 

use of drugs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new program is designed 

to capture and pool some existing spending for prescription drugs for Medicare 

patients. &quot;This would freeze the contributions of state Medicaid programs 

and private employer retiree plans at 2002 levels, relieving them of a soaring 

cost while helping to help finance the new benefit,&quot; says Sager.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The plan would allow for 

an 8.5 percent annual rise in Medicare prescription drug spending, before counting 

the cost of the increase in medication use when patients gain coverage. &quot;Such 

a limit is essential to make drugs affordable,&quot; says Sager, &quot;and it 

can be achieved while assuring access to all needed medications, yet preserving 

manufacturers' returns on equity and funding for research.&quot;</font></p>

Tierney and the National Security and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee of the House 

Government Reform Committee sponsored the hearing at the McCormack Court House.</font></p>
