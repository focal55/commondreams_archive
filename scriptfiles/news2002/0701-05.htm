- July 1 - As the EPA touted its &quot;Clear Skies&quot; proposal today, clean 
air activists called on Administrator Whitman and the Bush Administration to drop 
their efforts to weaken current clean air rules.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Administration announced last month that it would finalize regulatory changes 
to the &quot;New Source Review&quot; program that would allow older power plants, 
refineries, chemical facilities and other industries to modify their operations 
in ways that will increase pollution levels without installing modern pollution 
controls, as required by today's law. This move could result in pollution increases 
at more than 17,000 facilities, and has the potential to increase emissions by 
hundreds of thousands of tons per year across the nation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This Administration, backed by the coal, electric and oil industries, 
has proposed the most devastating attack on the Clean Air Act in its 30-year history,&quot; 
said Becky Stanfield, Clean Air Advocate for U.S. PIRG. &quot;Today's EPA announcements 
are little more than an attempt to focus public attention away from this attack, 
by touting a policy which is unlikely to become law, and in any event would not 
undo the harm caused by the regulatory changes,&quot; she continued.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Clear Skies proposal, according to EPA's own analysis performed last September, 
would result in more pollution emitted from the electric power industry than if 
EPA were to simply enforce the existing programs under the current Clean Air Act. 
Specifically, Clear Skies would allow the emissions of:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">36% more nitrogen oxides, which cause the formation of ozone &quot;smog.&quot; 
Smog 
triggers an estimated 6 million asthma attacks per year.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 50% more sulfur dioxide, which causes formation of fine particle &quot;soot&quot; 
which in turn causes heart and lung disease leading to tens of thousands of premature 
deaths per year. Sulfur dioxide is also the leading cause of acid rain.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Three to five times more toxic mercury, which has contaminated the fish in 
40 states. Consumption of these mercury-laced fish can cause neurological damage, 
especially for young children.</p> </font>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Already 30,000 people die prematurely each year due to power plant pollution,&quot; 
said Stanfield. &quot;The combination of eliminating current clean air protections, 
and substituting an entirely hypothetical, weaker set of pollution limits will 
mean more sickness, premature death, acid rain, and mercury contamination,&quot; 
she continued. The activists noted that while the Administration is weakening 
rules for many sources of pollution, including power plants, refineries, pulp 
and paper mills, chemical plants and others, their Clear Skies proposal only covers 
power plants. Therefore, increases in pollution from refineries and other industries 
would not be mitigated under Clear Skies were this proposal to become law.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, the activists contrasted the Clear Skies proposal with the Clean Power 
Act passed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last week. That 
bill, authored by Senators Jeffords (I-VT) and Lieberman (D-CT) would: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Require steeper reductions for mercury, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, 
which would take effect a decade earlier than the Clear Skies proposal.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Require reductions in carbon dioxide, the leading cause of global warming 
to 1990 levels. The Clear Skies proposal ignores the need to address global warming 
by omitting limits on carbon dioxide pollution.<br>
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Retain all of the current programs under the Clean Air Act including the 
New Source Review program.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Jeffords Clean Power Act is a common-sense approach to comprehensively 
addressing power plant pollution,&quot; said Stanfield. &quot;By contrast, the 
Bush Clear Skies proposal will take us backwards on clean air, and that is unacceptable,&quot; 
she concluded.</font></p>
