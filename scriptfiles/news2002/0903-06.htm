- September 3 - Organizers of a community media conference taking place in Seattle 

this September hope their events will draw public attention to a number of issues 

bearing on the media's role in a democratic society. The conference, titled &quot;Reclaim 

the Media: a Community Media Convergence,&quot; runs from Sept. 10-15, 2002, and 

will draw prominent independent media journalists, broadcasters and media reform 

activists from across the US and Canada. Complete information is available on 

the web at <a href="http://www.reclaimthemedia.org" target="_new">www.reclaimthemedia.org</a>.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The conference is scheduled to &quot;shadow&quot; the National Association 

of Broadcasters' annual radio conference, also in Seattle. Reclaim the Media events 

will include rallies in protest of what activists charge are the anti-democratic 

policy priorities of the NAB, a powerful industry lobby which has often helped 

shape federal media regulation to the liking of the wealthiest media owners.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The keynote address, &quot;Independent Media in a Time of War,&quot; will be 

given by Amy Goodman, co-host of Pacifica Radio's national news program &quot;Democracy 

Now&quot; (broadcast in Seattle on KBCS-FM and on the public access cable station 

SCAN, channels 29, 77). Other prominent speakers include &quot;Alternative Radio&quot; 

host David Barsamian, media policy reform advocate DeeDee Halleck, microradio 

visionary Ron Sakolsky and hip-hop political activist and Oakland-based public 

affairs radio host Davey D.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conference events center upon a day-long teach-in to be held Friday the 13th 

at Town Hall. Panel topics, united by the theme of Media and Democracy, include 

media ownerhip, community media, microradio, labor media, media coverage of the 

war on terror, and others. Additional conference events include media-related 

workshops, lectures and performances, and three afternoons of music, public speakers 

and information tables at a rally in Freeway Park - right on the doorstep of the 

NAB's conference venue, the Washington State Convention Center.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thematically, the Reclaim the Media conference will link together several reformist 

threads:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Unprededented concentration of media ownership is adversely affecting 

diverse views and local accountability in print and broadcast media, as more and 

more stations and newspapers are bought up by remote megacorporations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Deregulation of ownership rules has had the most extreme effects in 

the radio industry, allowing Clear Channel to amass over 1200 stations nationwide, 

along with its billboard, concert promotion, television and other interests. The 

company has pioneered technology which fools listeners into thinking that remotely-produced, 

&quot;localized&quot; programming originates from their own communities.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8226; Recent and proposed regulatory changes to cable broadband services 

will give private companies monopoly control over local Internet service, and 

will allow them to invisibly filter content from competing companies, or based 

upon political or other criteria.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reclaim the Media organizers expect to attract the interest of many NAB conference 

attendees, as well as the basic audience of Seattleites and national community 

media. According to Jonathan Lawson, &quot;unions representing commercial broadcasting 

and newspaper employees have endorsed our conference for a reason. The NAB's priorities 

- bigger corporate profits at the expense of diversity, quality and local control 

- offend many radio engineers and announcers, even local station managers. After 

five years of unprecedented industry consolidation, many radio employees are answering 

to new bosses a thousand miles away, and are critiquing the industry from the 

inside, just as we are from the outside.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reclaim the Media is one of a growing number of independently planned conferences 

and gatherings building a social movement focusing on media and democracy issues. 

When the NAB held their Radio Conference in San Francisco two years ago, community 

radio activists staged a counter-conference critical of the NAB's stance opposing 

Low-Power FM radio licensing. In March 2002, demonstrations at the Washington, 

DC headquarters of the FCC drew attention to public statements in which FCC Chairman 

Michael Powell ridiculed the idea that his regulatory agency should be guided 

by the &quot;Public Interest&quot; rather than by market trends. On October 19 

of this year, media reform activists will commemorate &quot;Media Democracy Day&quot; 

in Albuquerque, Toronto, Vancouver and other cities.</font></p>
