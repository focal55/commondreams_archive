- June 6 - Young women and girls face 

widespread sex discrimination in high school vocational and 

technical education programs across the country. Pervasive sex 

segregation, sexual harassment in the classroom, discrimination in 

counseling and recruiting, and other gender-based bias are creating 

serious barriers to their future earning power, according to a 

nationwide investigation released today by the National Women's Law 

Center (NWLC). NWLC examined problems in depth in Arizona, 

California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 

Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington 

State. (View state information at <a href="http://www.nwlc.org" target="_new">http://www.nwlc.org</a> or call 

202-588-5180.) </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result of these findings, NWLC today issued a report and 

filed 12 Petitions for Compliance Review -- one in each regional 

office of the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. 

The petitions request Title IX investigations of -- and demand 

remedies for -- sex discrimination in vocational and technical 

education across the country. Title IX is the law, passed 30 years 

ago this month, that bars sex discrimination in all aspects of 

federally funded education. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirty years after Title IX, boys are still being steered toward 

courses that lead to traditionally male, and higher paying, careers 

in technology and the trades, while girls are clustered in programs 

that lead to lower paying jobs in cosmetology, child care and the 

like. National patterns of sex segregation, based on data in the 

12 states, shows that 96 percent of cosmetology students are 

female, as are 87 percent of those enrolled in child care courses, 

and 86 percent of those enrolled in health aide preparation 

courses. Meanwhile, boys comprise over 90 percent of the students 

enrolled in carpentry, automotive, and plumbing. The pattern of 

sex segregation is even worse in some states. For example, in 

Florida, 99 percent of the students in cosmetology are female, 

while 100 percent of the students taking plumbing are male. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pervasive sex segregation of female students into 

traditionally female programs severely compromises their future 

earning power. For example, cosmetologists earn a median hourly 

salary of $8.49 and child care workers earn a median hourly salary 

of $7.43. In contrast, students in the predominantly male, 

higher-wage careers can earn median hourly salaries of almost $20 

as plumbers, electricians or mechanical drafters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beyond the data showing stark patterns of sex segregation, NWLC 

obtained additional information that underscores the sex 

discrimination that girls face in vocational education. This 

includes teachers who help male students get summer jobs but do not 

help female students; guidance counselors who steer female students 

into cosmetology based on their lower expectations for them; and 

schools that fail to protect girls from sexual harassment. 

Moreover, half of the states across the country have not met their 

legal duty to designate a Title IX coordinator to carry out the 

states' responsibilities under the law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Young women enrolled in traditionally female programs often 

receive inferior educations. Today's actions follow NWLC's 

finding last year that New York City's vocational schools were 

highly sex segregated and that the predominantly female schools, 

unlike the male schools, offered almost no advanced math or science 

courses. Special technology programs, like Cisco Networking 

Academies, which lead to industry certification in computer 

networking and jobs that pay between $42,000 and over $100,000 per 

year, were placed in the predominantly male schools, but were not 

available in the schools attended by young women. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;High school vocational and technical education programs can 

provide a path to economic independence for many young women and 

girls. Thirty years after Title IX, it is unconscionable that 

their dreams and futures are still being shortchanged,&quot; said Marcia 

D. Greenberger, NWLC co-president. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Girls in vocational and technical programs suffer 

discriminatory practices that discourage them from progressing and 

succeeding. These girls have to tolerate instructors who really 

don't take them seriously and deny them the experience of any real 

training. Instead, they are given the attendance book or other 

administrative duties while the boys are being trained with the 

tools,&quot; said Geri Harston, a Chicago electrician and recruiter for 

the nation's second largest electrical apprenticeship program. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Melissa Barbier, director of girls' programs at the Chicago 

Women in Trades, said, &quot;I've seen first hand the obstacles girls 

must overcome to enter the trades. But I've also seen the positive 

results when schools make the effort to provide an encouraging 

environment for girls in the nontraditional trades, and when they 

inform girls about the financial benefits and consequences of their 

career choices.&quot; </font></p>
