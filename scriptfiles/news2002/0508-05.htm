- May 8 - The following is a statement 

by Clean Air Trust naming Sen. Kent Conrad as &quot;Clean Air Villian 

of the Month&quot;: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why would a United States senator interfere with active federal 

investigations of air pollution violations by coal-burning electric 

power producers? </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's the question we pose to the &quot;Clean Air Villain of the 

Month&quot; for May 2002 -- Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND). Senator Conrad 

has joined one of our previous &quot;villains,&quot; Senator George Voinovich 

(R-OH), in circulating a letter to his colleagues seeking to 

pressure the Environmental Protection Agency to weaken clean-air 

requirements for the electric power industry. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, the senators' letter asks EPA to change its &quot;new 

source review&quot; rules to allow electric power producers to &quot;avoid 

the regulatory uncertainty currently facing the industry.&quot; The 

letter adopts the rhetoric used by lobbyists for electric power 

companies with close connections to the Republican Party. (see note) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You may wonder what sort of &quot;regulatory uncertainty&quot; is 

involved. In fact, two North Dakota-based electric co-ops, 

Basin Electric Power Cooperative and Minnkota Power Cooperative, 

are under active federal investigation for possible violations 

of new source review. At a minimum, this letter raises a question 

of the appropriateness of a United States senator appearing 

to interfere with an ongoing investigation of alleged illegal 

acts by the co-ops. (Needless to say, a similar question should 

be raised about Voinovich: the Justice Department has filed 

lawsuits against several big Ohio power companies, including 

American Electric Power, First Energy and Cinergy.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Conrad's involvement appears to have been inspired by these 

politically active cooperatives. Minnkota represented the 

National Rural Electric Cooperative Association last fall when 

Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT) convened a &quot;stakeholders' meeting&quot; to 

examine so-called &quot;multi-pollutant&quot; legislation. As might be 

expected for a company under active investigation for alleged 

wrongdoing, Minnkota used the occasion to call for elimination of 

new source review under a &quot;cap and trade&quot; system. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Basin Electric achieved some notoriety in a recent report that 

noted it emits more of the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide per 

megawatt than any other electric power producer in the nation. 

Basin Electric is also spearheading utility industry efforts to 

weaken upcoming EPA standards for toxic air pollutants, including 

mercury, from electric power plants. Basin Electric is among 

those seeking to build new lignite-fired power plants in western 

North Dakota. In his last election, Conrad was the leading Senate 

recipient of PAC contributions by Basin Electric </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To pave the way for the new energy projects, Basin Electric is 

lobbying to convince North Dakota to carve out a new loophole that 

would permit increased pollution that would harm the Theodore 

Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota. (Despite opposition from 

EPA and the National Park Service, the state is seeking to change 

the method of calculating emissions that affect the park. The 

Basin Electric-backed state plan would permit more pollution. If 

new source review were eliminated, entities such as Basin Electric 

would no longer have to account for the impact of their emissions 

on a national park or wilderness area.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is puzzling that Conrad -- who sharply criticized one of his 

Democratic colleagues for supporting the Bush Administration's tax 

cuts -- would provide cover for the administration's dirty-air 

policies. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And there is some irony, of course, that a Democrat like Conrad 

is doing the bidding of a co-op seeking to sully the only national 

park named in honor of the ex-President most often cited by 

Republicans for their environmental pedigree. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">------ </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOTE: 

The language is almost verbatim that used by attorney Scott 

Segal, who represents such major power companies as Southern Co. 

and First Energy. Segal's colleague, former Montana Gov. Mark 

Racicot, is chairman of the Republican National Committee. He 

ceased active lobbying for the power companies only after his dual 

role as lobbyist and political party chief sparked controversy. </font></p>
