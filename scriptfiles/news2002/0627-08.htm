YORK - June 27 - A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled today that all junior high 
and high school students can be required to undergo drug testing in order to participate 
in extracurricular activities - a decision which opens the door for drug testing 
the more than 23 million students enrolled in public high schools across the country. 
Drug education experts, pediatricians and privacy advocates expressed strong criticism 
of the ruling. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The court's decision is both foolhardy and dangerous in sending exactly 
the wrong message to America's children -- that they have no right to privacy, 
and that schools can prioritize the cleanliness of one's urine over academic achievement 
and participation in student life,&#8221; said Judy Appel, deputy legal director 
for the Drug Policy Alliance and counsel for the National Education Association 
and the American Academy of Pediatrics in their friend-of-the-court brief.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drug Policy Alliance represented the National Education Association, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, and a coalition of other national organizations in arguing 
that the policy would not accomplish its alleged goals of deterring drug use -- 
and that it would actually interfere with more sound prevention and treatment 
models. The Alliance also notes that involvement in extra-curricular activities 
actually helps to prevent students from using drugs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Opponents of drug testing stressed that even though the Court has allowed the 
policy, schools are still free to reject drug testing and instead opt for drug 
education models that effectively help protect students&#8217; health. &#8220;Drug 
education programs that are rooted in trust and mutual respect between students 
and teachers have the most potential for success,&#8221; said Marsha Rosenbaum, 
Director of the Safety First Project for Drug Policy Alliance. &#8220;Parents 
and schools should actively oppose the implementation of drug testing policies 
that actually erode trust and respect.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently, only three percent of the 15,000 school districts nationwide have 
opted to drug test students.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their earlier statement to the court, drug testing opponents argued that 
&#8220;adult decision makers-parents, doctors, school boards, and courts-have 
a special obligation to promote policies that realistically promise to help young 
people-and to resist measures, however well-intentioned, that are inconsistent 
with that objective.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lower court supported the students, holding that &#8220;we do not believe 
that voluntary participation in an activity&#8230;should reduce a student&#8217;s 
expectation of privacy in his or her body.&#8221; The school district appealed 
this decision to the Supreme Court.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the case that was decided -Board of Education of Pottawatomie County v. 
Earls-students from a school in Tecumseh, Oklahoma challenged the constitutionality 
of a school-wide drug testing policy that served as a prerequisite to student 
involvement in any non-athletic extracurricular activity. The school intended 
to bar students from activities like Quiz bowl, Future Homemakers of America, 
chess club and choir if they refused to consent to a drug test. Students Lindsay 
Earls and Daniel James, concerned about jeopardizing their college admissions 
prospects if they refused to consent to a drug test, decided to challenge the 
school&#8217;s policy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parents from the Tecumseh, Oklahoma school opposed the drug testing policy, 
noting that drug testing creates an atmosphere of distrust and disrespect at school, 
and that it usurps parents&#8217; authority to make decisions about how their 
children are raised. </font></p>
