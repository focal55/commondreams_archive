- August 4 - It is always heartbreaking to see whales in distress. The vivid photographs 

and video footage of the helpless pilot whales on Cape Cod have been especially 

upsetting to people all over the world. Despite tremendous rescue attempts by 

seasoned whale rescuers and vacationers alike, the whales never made it back into 

the ocean.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one really knows why this type of beaching occurs or why this behavior is 

so common among whales. However, the Cape Cod beaching reminds us of just how 

fragile these great creatures are and why we must do everything we can to protect 

their natural environment.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Right now, a much larger threat to total whale populations is continued commercial 

whaling. Japan, Norway, Iceland and possibly other countries that engage in commercial 

whaling are responsible for the deaths of over 1500 whales each year. Even though 

a moratorium on commercial whaling has been in effect since 1986, Japan and Norway 

continue to kill almost 30 times the number of whales that washed up on Cape Cod. 

They do this without ever having to answer for their actions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pro-whaling countries are desperate to overturn the ban on commercial whaling. 

Japan has spent $323 million in fisheries development aid to buy the votes of 

member countries within the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The clearest 

illustration of Japan's vote buying came at last May's IWC meeting, when Japan 

and countries under its influence blocked the renewal of an aboriginal subsistence 

quota for Alaskan Natives to punish the U.S. for its strong stance against commercial 

whaling. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whales have also been suffering more recent setbacks. On July 15th, Norway 

exported eight tons of meat and blubber to Iceland in an attempt to undermine 

CITES, the global convention that regulates trade in endangered species. This 

came the same day that the Bush Administration allowed the Navy to start using 

its low frequency sonar system, which could cause fatal internal damage to whales. 

The 55 pilot whales stranding on Cape Cod just two weeks later is yet another 

hit to endangered whale populations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite threats such as commercial whaling, military testing, overfishing and 

pollution, there is hope. It was touching to see the numerous volunteers, marine 

experts and even young children rushing to help the stranded pilot whales. And 

while sadly these whales could not be saved, others still have a chance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greenpeace has been leading the global fight to protect whales since 1975. 

But Greenpeace alone cannot save all the whales from the increasing number of 

threats they face. Making the oceans safe for whales depends on people worldwide.
