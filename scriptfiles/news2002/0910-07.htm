<BR>

As the Senate debates the Homeland Security Act (HSA) in this 9-11 anniversary 

week, a pivotal legislative fight is brewing over whistleblower protections for 

170,000 employees of the proposed Homeland Security Department. The existing Whistleblower 

Protection Act has been rendered practically unenforceable by hostile court decisions. 

Critics complain the House version of the HSA further undermines internal administrative 

recourse for federal security workers who are threatened with reprisals and dismissal 

for speaking out on security problems. Below are examples of whistleblowers who 

braved reprisals to disclose serious failings in everything from airport security 

to border patrols. Such disclosures, if taken seriously by agency management instead 

of met with reprisals and covered up, might have helped thwart the 9-11 terrorist 

attacks, or future attacks. Those whistleblowers, along with whistleblower rights 

advocates and members of Congress leading the debate this week on including stronger 

whistleblower protections in the Homeland Security Act, are available now for 

interviews. </font></P>

WHISTLEBLOWER RIGHTS ADVOCATES <BR>

<BR>

Martin Edwin "Mick" Andersen -- Former senior advisor to the Justice Department 

who flagged leaks and abuses at the International Criminal Investigation and Assistance 

Program. He was stripped of his security clearance and lost his job, though his 

disclosures prompted investigations which confirmed his allegations, and now works 

with the Government Accountability Project. <BR>

<BR>

Tom Devine -- Legal Director, Government Accountability Project, helped or represented 

over 2,000 whistleblowers during last 23 years, and helped write and led citizens' 

campaigns to pass, the Whistleblower Protection Act, Military Whistleblower Protection 

Act, and equivalent corporate whistleblower laws. </font></P>

</font>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHISTLEBLOWERS <BR>

<BR>

Diane Kleiman -- US Customs Special Agent who flagged serious security lapses 

at American Airlines and drug abuse among special agents. Six months prior to 

9-11 she warned the US Attorney's office in New York "a tragedy would occur because 

of lack of security at JFK airport and corruption within Customs." <BR>

<BR>

Bogdan Dzakovic -- Federal Aviation Administration team leader who flagged gross 

security lapses at airports which detected simulated bombs only 3-10% of the time. 

He was threatened with firing and false charges of in-office violence. <BR>

<BR>

Mark Hall and Robert Lindenmann -- National Border Patrol Agents who defied an 

INS gag order went to Congress and the NBC Today Show with news of serious security 

lapses along the northern US border, including failure to perform criminal background 

checks on those caught crossing illegally. The INS tried to summarily demote, 

transfer, and fire them. <BR>

<BR>

Linda Lewis -- A USDA Emergency Programs Specialist responsible for analyzing 

evacuation plans and food supply protection against chemical and radiological 

attack. She flagged serious weaknesses in federally mandated emergency preparedness 

and testing that leave the public vulnerable to attacks. In retaliation, she was 

suspended for the last three years, subjected to psychiatric exams, and recently 

stripped of her security clearance. Darlene Catalan and Sandy Nunn -- Former US 

Customs Special Agents at the Los Angeles port who flagged systemic failure to 

inspect contents of 98-99% of the more than 300,000 foreign tanker cars and container 

ships entering each month. Their holds on suspicious shipments were routinely 

overridden. They brought their findings to Congress and the FBI, and in retaliation 

were investigated, suspended without pay and harassed into resignation. </font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cathy Harris -- Senior US 

Customs Inspector at the Atlanta International Airport flagged racial profiling 

and intrusive searches of black female travelers while drugs flowed freely through 

the airport. Congressional investigations validated her findings and legislated 

changes, but she was placed on 15 months' unpaid stress leave, filed two bankruptcies 

and lost her home. </font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> BACKGROUND<BR>

<BR>

The Senate is now contemplating amendments to the HSA which would strengthen gutted 

whistleblower<BR>

protections for the roughly 170,000 workers of the new security agency, and provide 

a potentially far-reaching counterweight to curtailment of the labor and civil 

rights of 2 million federal workers in the wake of 9-11.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush this week 

reiterated a demand for "management flexibility" in overseeing the Homeland Security 

Department, including full executive discretion over hiring and firing, and repeated 

his threat to veto the Homeland Security Act and cast Senate Democrats as soft 

on defense if the Senate "ties its hands" by stipulating any limits to that discretion.<BR>

<BR>

The White House says it champions federal workers rights, but as The Wall Street 

Journal reported September 9, Mr. Bush himself has promised to preserve "whistle-blower 

protection[s]...even while insisting that Congress give him authority to waive 

them." The White House claims that authority on national security grounds, but 

security experts counter that waiving whistle-blower protections materially harms 

national security.<BR>

<BR>

"Government agencies too often want to cover up their mistakes, and the temptation 

is even greater when bureaucracies can use a potential security issue as an excuse," 

said Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who along with Senator Carl Levin (D-Michigan) 

is introducing an amendment on stronger whistleblower protections to the Homeland 

Security Act. "At the same time, the information whistleblowers provide is all 

the more important when public safety and security is at stake."<BR>

<BR>

"Excessive secrecy enforced by repression can threaten national security by covering 

up government breakdowns and sustain unnecessary vulnerability to terrorism," 

Senator Robert Byrd (D- West Virginia) said in a recent speech.<BR>

"Congress overwhelmingly approved state-of-the-art corporate whistleblower protection 

as an encouragement for private sector workers to defend America's financial markets. 

Our homeland security requires similar rights for government workers to make disclosures 

in defending American families against terrorism." <BR>

<BR>

Byrd's speech cited the examples of National Border Patrol Agents Mark Hall and 

Robert Lindenmann, who became targets of INS reprisals for disclosing serious 

security failures along the US-Canada border. Hall and Lindenmann are among the 

whistleblowers now available for media interviews, along with members of Congress 

leading the current debate on strengthening whistleblower protections for federal 

security workers. <BR>

<BR>

Failing to eliminate such reprisals, say security experts and rights advocates, 

violates not only workers' rights, but also the imperative to maximize Americans' 

security in the post 9-11 world. </font></P>
