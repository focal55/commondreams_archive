<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JOHANNESBURG - August 27 

- At a non-governmental organization (NGO) briefing at the World Summit on Sustainable 

Development today, Food First/the Institute for Food and Development Policy, a 

U.S.-based NGO, together with activists from developing countries, criticized 

the U.S. delegation's attempt to sell the recently passed 2002 Farm Bill as a&quot;conservation&quot; 

bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Addressing a U.S. delegation-sponsored 

NGO meeting, Jim Moseley, Deputy Secretary, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, and Jennifer 

Haverkamp, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, praised the U.S. farm bill and 

U.S. farm policy in general, as something which &quot;promotes development in 

the Third World.&quot; Questioning by activists drew the comment that proposals 

to protect agriculture and farmer communities in the Third World through domestic 

supports, would be fiercely resisted by the U.S.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Small farmers throughout 

the Third World have seen prices for their crops plummet, as heavily subsidized 

crops from industrialized countries have been dumped in their local economies, 

collapsing local agricultural markets and throwing many small farmers out of business. 

The United States, in its pursuit of trade, has aggressively sought out these 

foreign markets for its agriculture, and today one out of three acres planted 

in the United States is exported. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;To call the Farm Bill 

a conservation bill is outrageous. It conserves nothing but the dominance of U.S. 

corporate agriculture, and spells doom for the family farmer both in the United 

States and the Third world,&quot; said Anuradha Mittal, Food First co-director 

who is attending the World Summit on Sustainable Agriculture in Johannesburg.&quot;The 

battle lines at this summit have been drawn between the poor countries and the 

rich. The farm bill is a fearsome stick with which to beat small farmers the world 

over.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Food First has just released 

a report, &quot;Giving Away the Farm: The 2002 Farm Bill,&quot; that sheds light 

on the implications of the bill for small farmers, trade, and agricultural sustainability. 

The report contends that the bill is designed to benefit the largest U.S. agritrade 

corporations, with U.S. government subsidies are directed toward export crops 

such as cotton, rice, soybeans, and wheat. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The bill betrays the 

United States' real interest at the WSSD. The delegation doesn't care about the 

environment, only the economy -- the economy of the rich, not the poor. One of 

the great myths perpetrated by the EU and the United States for the past few decades 

is that free trade helps small farmers and the poor. But it doesn't. Attempts 

to leave farmers at the mercy of the free market only accomplish their hastened 

demise,&quot; said Mittal.&quot;And with this farm bill, the only winners are 

the corporations that have access to the cheap commodities created by subsidies, 

so they can export these crops and sell them below market prices.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report concludes that 

the farm bill points to the hypocrisy of the industrialized nations in trade negotiations, 

renews the call for the World Trade Organization to get out of agriculture, and 

demands that governments to uphold the rights of all people to food sovereignty.
