- July 24 - The following statement from the Clean Air Trust was released today: 

</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were dumbstruck to learn yesterday that the Pew Center On 

Global Climate Change -- a nonprofit group that works with industry 

on &quot;cooperative approaches&quot; to &quot;advance the debate&quot; on climate 



change -- is issuing a report today critical of a key enforcement 

tool of the Clean Air Act -- new source review. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were further dumbstruck, however, when we learned that the 

Pew Center, funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts, had hired industry 

lobbyists to write the report! These lobbyists have worked 

separately (for chemical and electric power industry clients) to 

weaken or eliminate this key enforcement tool. (1) And their law 

firm, Van Ness Feldman, proudly boasts on its Internet site that: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The firm's experience and understanding of state and EPA 

enforcement policies and personnel have allowed Van Ness Feldman to 

advise clients on creative ways of responding to enforcement 

proceedings. We counsel clients in actions brought by agencies and 

in review proceedings concerning conditions (or denials) of 

permits. In each case, we help clients evaluate the merits of 

agency claims and the risks of litigation. The firm then develops 

litigation, regulatory, and/or legislative strategies for prompt 

resolution of the matter. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Most recently, we are representing electric utilities and 

refineries targeted by the EPA New Source Review enforcement 

initiatives.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Pew report, the industry lobbyists repeat electric 

utility industry propaganda that new source review has discouraged 

power companies from &quot;undertaking efficiency improvements&quot; and 

suggest that policy makers should &quot;distinguish investments that 

raise conversion efficiency from those that simply increase the 

capacity of existing coal-fired plants.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As one expert environmental lawyer explained it to us, &quot;this is 

a false and misleading distinction.&quot; (2) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can't fathom why the Pew Center would seek to promote these 

industry views. We can only speculate that the leaders of the Pew 

Center are less interested in the truth than in aligning the 

organization with the goals of some of its industry partners - 

including American Electric Power and Cinergy, which face Justice 

Department lawsuits for alleged violations of new source review. 

Obviously they don't realize that tough and continued enforcement 

of the Clean Air Act would also lead to a reduction in greenhouse 

gas emissions, which is their ostensible goal. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">------ 

(1) The report's authors are Douglas W. Smith, Robert R. 

Nordhaus and Thomas C. Roberts of Van Ness Feldman, and Marc Chupka 

of The Brattle Group. Nordhaus has lobbied for American Electric 

Power, which is being sued by the Justice Department for allegedly 

violating new source review. Smith and Roberts lobby for the 

American Chemistry Council, which has applauded EPA's recent 

announcement that it would change new source review. The chemistry 

council also called on Congress last month to provide &quot;relief&quot; from 



the Clean Air Act. Chupka notes on his resume that he recently 

&quot;has assisted clients in preparing for New Source Review 

litigation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) The lawyer went on to say: &quot;The reason is that investments that simply 

raise conversion efficiency -- without increasing capacity or utilization -- should 

not trigger NSR, because NSR is ONLY triggered by significant increases in annual 

(total) emissions. In other words, energy efficiency improvements that decrease 

emissions per unit of output and decrease -- or maintain -- overall emissions 

do not trigger NSR today and they never have and they never will. What this paragraph 

is arguing for implicitly is the ability to &quot;raise conversion efficiency&quot; 

and raise overall emissions levels without triggering NSR to control those increased 

emissions levels. From an NSR perspective, those conversion efficiency improvements 

that increase total emissions (through increased utilization, expanded capacity) 

are no different from increases in the capacity of existing coal-fired plants 

that increase total emissions. The omission of these basic points -- that NSR 

is triggered only by increases in overall emissions, and that energy efficiency 

improvements that maintain or decrease emissions do not trigger NSR -- is strong 

evidence to me of the dishonesty of (these sections of) the report's analysis 

and the pro-industry, anti-NSR agenda in these passages. (For example, the utility 

industry has long argued that NSR should be triggered only by increases in emissions 

per unit of production, a test whose defining characteristic is that it is never 

triggered, while overall emissions levels are allowed to increase to the maximum, 

theoretical capacity of the units.)&quot; </font></p>
