- September 4 - The Sierra Club today said that the most remarkable product of 

the Johannesburg World Summit on the environment was the degree to which other 

world leaders were willing to reject the Bush administration's misguided climate 

policy. The organization believes that the Bush administration's refusal to adequately 

address climate change would harm US business.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America's largest trading partner 

Canada, as well as America's greatest ally, Great Britain, have announced their 

intention to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. Russia, China and Mexico 

have also committed to ratify,&quot; said Michael Dorsey, a Sierra Club director. 

&quot;These countries and others have chosen to act in spite of the Bush administration's 

strenuous attempt to keep the climate issue off of the Summit agenda.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;American businesses now risk 

being left behind as our neighbors and competitors invest more resources in new, 

clean and efficient technologies,&quot; continued Dorsey. &quot;The heat is on 

the US to get serious about addressing the global climate crisis.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While many heads of state from around 

the world used the opportunity of the largest international meeting in history 

to announce their country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the 

Summit's &quot;Plan of Action&quot; inadequately addresses sustainable development 

and environmental protection. Commitments to provide clean water and sanitation 

for the poor were undermined by the lack of measurable goals.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Bush administration worked 

furiously to remove renewable energy targets and timetables from the final plan 

of action,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Director of the Sierra Club's International 

Program. &quot;But in effect what they have done is to insure that American business 

will follow, not lead the rest of the world. The White House has shown that it 

is not only out of touch with the majority of Americans, it is also out of touch 

with the rest of the world.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush administration put forward 

voluntary partnerships with business as the means to protect the environment, 

while at the same time rejecting international corporate accountability.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Partnerships, especially corporate 

partnerships, must be subject to an international framework of binding accountability,&quot; 

said Mills. &quot;Americans know that corporate self-policing doesn't work, the 

Enron and WorldCom scandals have shown us this the hard way. We simply don't want 

corporations to do to our environment what they have done to our 401K's.&quot;
