<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 

- July 25 - The air-breathing 

snakehead fish found in suburban Maryland has received national 

attention, but it's only one of more than 30,000 invasive species 

that now call the United States home and are making life difficult 

for the species that were there first. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And while the snakehead has become a national celebrity - 

rightly so, with its ability to survive out of water and even 

propel itself short distances across land with their fins - many 

species are even more detrimental to the habitats they have 

invaded. Flying Asian carp in Lake Erie, piranhas in a lake in 

Iowa, and citrus long-horned beetles in Seattle are among this 

notorious group. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;An aggressive predator such as the snakehead can be disastrous 

for native wildlife,&quot; said John Morrison of WWF's Conservation 

Science Program. &quot;But the threat from an invasive species like the 

snakehead is nothing new. They're everywhere. In fact, just looking 

outside my office window right now, the only birds I see are 

pigeons, house sparrows and starlings, all natives of Europe. 

Starlings, for example, compete with native birds for cavities to 

nest in. While it's probably too late to address starlings in our 

environment, we should actively try to prevent other non-native 

species from becoming established here.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The snakehead found in Maryland has been traced to an individual 

who dumped it in the pond after it outgrew his home aquarium. 

Snakeheads can grow to be a foot and a half long, live three days 

out of water and prey on frogs, aquatic birds and even small 

mammals. None of this is a problem in the snakehead's home range in 

China where its population is kept in check by an array of 

predators. But none of the snakehead's predators live in the United 

States. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Invasives are a big problem because once they're in an 

ecosystem, they can be difficult or even impossible to remove,&quot; 

continued Morrison. &quot;Invasives thrive because they outcompete 

native species, having left most of their natural predators, 

competitors and diseases behind.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Invasive cost the U.S. economy $123 billion a year, according to 

a Cornell University study. Weeds and diseases in crops top the 

list of the most damaging invaders, costing the nation more than 

$53 billion annually. Rats are next on the list, causing $19 

billion a year in damages. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Invasives around the U.S. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- West -- Found in all western states, and even in some eastern 

states, the leafy spurge plant is a plague for cattle ranchers, 

reducing the productivity of grazing land by 50 to 75 percent and 

costing the U.S. economy $100 million each year. Leafy spurge 

displaces native vegetation and sends out plant toxins that prevent 

the growth of other plants underneath it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- East Coast -- Say goodbye to that favorite hemlock tree. The 

tiny hemlock woolly adelgid, accidentally introduced in the '50s 

from Japan, kills hemlocks in just four years. The threat is so 

severe that hemlocks might go the way of chestnut trees, which once 

accounted for nearly a quarter of the trees in eastern forests, but 

were virtually wiped out by an invasive fungus around the turn of 

the century. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Great Lakes and Mississippi -- In just 14 years, zebra 

mussels have spread throughout many of the major waterways in the 

central United States. Native to eastern Europe and western Asia, 

the zebra mussel this year may cost $5 billion in the Great Lakes 

region alone to control, according to the U.S. Geological Survey 

estimates. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Southeast -- Kudzu, a fast-growing vine from Asia that can 

smother a mature tree, was brought to this country for the 

Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. Soon after, it 

became a popular shade vine in the south. The U.S. government even 

paid people to grow it to control erosion. Millions are now spent 

trying to control it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Sunbelt -- Ask any boater in the coastal Sunbelt and they 

will tell you about thick carpets of hydrilla floating in rivers 

and lakes. Native to Africa, Asia and Australia, the plant was 

introduced to Florida where it was cultivated for the aquarium 

industry. The weed now chokes waterways from California to 

Maryland. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Northeast -- The wetlands of the Northeast and Upper Midwest 

are today full of beautiful purple flowers. Unfortunately the 

purple loosestrife flower has become a menace, sucking up water, 

outcompeting native species and providing little or no habitat for 

native species. The plant came to this country from Europe and is 

still planted as an ornamental. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Hawaii and Guam -- Islands have, by far, the worst problems 

with invasives. Islands often have unusual species that are 

vulnerable to introduced species like the brown tree snake, which 

has killed off nine of Guam's 11 native birds. In some forested 

areas there are more than 12,000 snakes per square mile. More than 

200 people have been treated for bites from this aggressive and 

venomous snake. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Solutions to the invasives problem are hard to come by. While 

education and enforcement efforts have been effective in some 

places, invasive species are a growing problem as the movement of 

plants and animals increases around the world. For example, 40,000 

gallons of ballast water is dumped into U.S. harbors every minute. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Considering the billions we spend fighting the invasives that 

are already here, we could do a better job preventing them from 

being introduced in the first place,&quot; said Craig Hoover, deputy 

director of TRAFFIC North America (TRAFFIC is a joint program of 

WWF and IUCN -- The World Conservation Union). &quot;We need to think 

long and hard about how and what we move around the globe because 

invasives can easily hitch a ride on planes, cars -- even on shoes 

-- and cause tremendous damage.&quot; </font></p>
