- June 27 - In a letter sent to 
Senators this morning, over 1,300 doctors, nurses and health 
professionals called for support of legislation that would 
dramatically cut emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide 
(SO2), mercury, and carbon dioxide from power plants. Hearing the 
call of health professionals around the nation, the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee passed the &quot;Clean Power Act 
of 2001,&quot; (S.556) introduced by Senator Jeffords (I-Vt.), that 
requires emission reductions of these four pollutants. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Power plants are the leading source of the harmful air 
pollution that is taking its toll on America's health,&quot; the letter 
states, and &quot;we urge you to take advantage of the opportunity 
before you to clean up America's air.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The EPW Committee's action today represents a huge leap towards 
cleaner air and improved health. The Clean Power Act is the most 
effective way to protect public health from air pollution and we 
call on the President to support this plan that will require 
stringent cuts of these four pollutants,&quot; said, Robert K. Musil, 
Ph.D., M.P.H., executive director and CEO of Physicians for Social 
Responsibility. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scores of new studies each year demonstrate that air pollution 
can be harmful to human health and that children, the elderly, and 
those with respiratory diseases are most susceptible. Power plants 
are the source of 67 percent of total U.S. emissions of SO2, more 
than a quarter of the nation's NOx, one third of the nation's 
mercury pollution, and the source of approximately 40 percent of 
carbon dioxide emissions. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studies indicate that exposure to SO2 and NOx can result in 
reduced lung function, increased asthma attacks, more visits to 
doctor's offices and emergency rooms, increased hospitalization 
rates, and even death. The effects of mercury can range from subtle 
losses of sensory or cognitive ability and developmental delays, to 
birth defects, to death. Children and pregnant women or women of 
childbearing age are most at risk. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carbon dioxide contributes to the blanketing effect of 
greenhouse gases that traps excess heat in our atmosphere. This 
forces global average temperatures to rise and the climate to 
change. Higher temperatures take their toll on human health, 
leading to an increase in cases of heat-related illnesses, water- 
and vector- borne disease, and exacerbating respiratory illnesses 
by increasing smog levels. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their letter, health professionals also spoke out against the 
Administration's proposed changes to current Clean Air Act -- New 
Source Review programs, calling for the full enforcement and 
support of programs that result in fewer emissions. </font></p>
