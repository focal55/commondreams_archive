- May 30 - Subpoenas began arriving today at polluting industries and industry groups, like Enron and the National Mining Association, as part of efforts by the Sierra Club to discover how they influenced Vice President

Cheney's Energy Task Force.   The Sierra Club is serving these subpoenas as

part of its efforts to discover what happened in secret meetings between Administration staff and energy industry officials, following last week's decision in federal court rejecting the government's request for dismissal of the case.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club began serving subpoenas today to Enron, Shell Oil, Exelon Corporation, Peabody Energy, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, the National Mining Association, and the Edison Electric Institute.  Washington, D.C. -based groups will be served today, the rest will follow in the next few days.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to ensure that no documents related to the Cheney Energy Task Force are destroyed, this first wave of subpoenas requires these groups and companies to preserve all such documents.  These companies and groups are not parties to the Sierra Club suit, but may have information critical to resolving whether the Cheney Task Force violated the law in holding secret meetings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The public deserves to know who was calling the shots when the Cheney Task Force made important decisions affecting clean air, clean water, and the future of America's energy supply,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.  &quot;When so much is at stake for every American, our energy policy should not be decided by energy executives in a back room.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These subpoenas send a clear message to Enron and others that destruction of documents will not be tolerated in this case,&quot; continued Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club suit asserts that by refusing to tell the public about the influence energy industries had in crafting national energy policy, the Cheney Task Force violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The Sierra Club is asking the court to require Vice President Cheney and other defendants to disclose to the American people what went on behind closed doors in the creation of the national energy policy. The suit has been consolidated with a similar suit filed by Judicial Watch.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The energy policy that ultimately came out of the Administration relies on aging technologies that will pollute our air and water, destroy special places and fail to reduce our dependence on oil and coal. At the very least, the American people deserve an explanation of why the Administration chose this path rather than safer and cleaner technologies that would protect the environment and save consumers money at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, Vice President Cheney and other Administration Officials were rebuffed by a Federal Court, as Judge Emmet Sullivan rejected their request to dismiss lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch challenging the Administration's attempts to keep Task Force meetings with energy industry executives secret.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club is asking for a full accounting of what happened behind the closed doors of the Cheney Energy Task Force, including:  who was in the room; what proposals did the energy industry executives and lobbyists make; what documents did the energy industry submit; and what Task Force documents did they review.</font></p>
