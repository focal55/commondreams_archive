Ehrenreich is a columnist for <i>The Progressive</i> and the author of <i>Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America</i>. She said today: "In the 'job-readiness'

programs routinely inflicted on welfare recipients since 1996, poor women have

it drummed into them that by getting a job they will win 'self-esteem' and, at

the same time, finally be able to provide a suitable 'role model' for their

children. Stigmatizing unemployment, or, more accurately, unpaid,

family-directed labor, obviously works to promote the kind of docility

businesses crave in their employees. Any job, no matter how dangerous, abusive,

or poorly paid, can be construed as better than no job at all. Temporary Assistance

to Needy Families, as 'reformed' welfare is called, does not of course rely on

an intangible 'ethic' to promote work; it requires recipients to take whatever

jobs are available, and usually the first job that comes along. Lose the job --

for example, because you have to stay home with a sick child -- and you may

lose whatever supplementary benefits you were receiving. The message is clear:

Do not complain or make trouble; accept employment on the bosses' terms or risk

homelessness and hunger. From a rational, economic, point of view, welfare

reform has been an effort to provide American business with disciplined -- and

in most cases, desperate -- workers."

Co-author of <i>Welfare Racism: Playing the Race Card Against America's Poor</i> and associate professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut, Cazenave said today:

"The public assistance system in the U.S. has been racialized since its

inception. Initially racism took form in the administration of the programs --

African Americans were blocked from receiving benefits, or had benefits at a

lower level. As AFDC was perceived as benefiting people of color, the attacks

on it from politicians increased, culminating with the destruction of that

program by Clinton in 1996. Now, Bush is using punitive work requirements that

exploit stereotypes of lazy African American women, and this while they have to

contend with an onerous bureaucracy as well as racial discrimination by both

case workers and employers, and are penalized for engaging in childrearing that

is not recognized as work."

National coordinator of Welfare Made a Difference Campaign, which counts among its members people who used to be on welfare, Accles said today: "Though welfare leaves

people in poverty -- a mother with two children in New York City would

typically get $577 a month (with $286 of that supposed to cover rent) and about

$250 in food stamps -- it is still a crucial lifeline."

Executive director of the Citizen Policies Institute and author of <i>We the People: Healing Our Democracy and Saving Our World</i>, Shafarman said today: "Every American

should have enough income for food and shelter. We should do this through a

guaranteed basic income rather than a cumbersome welfare system. Further, this

should be combined with having everyone volunteer eight hours a month. These

would be mutually enabling and mutually reinforcing programs. Compared with

Bush's proposals on welfare and volunteerism, the Citizen Policies alternative

would be both more compassionate and more conservative.&quot;</font>
