Dam, Uganda </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHAT: Demonstration Outside World Bank and Release of Letters from Ugandan 
and U.S. NGOs Calling for Delay in Board Vote</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHEN: Monday, June 17, 5:30 PM</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WHERE: The World Bank, 18th and H Streets NW, Washington DC</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BACKGROUND</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the World Bank prepares to consider further financing of the controversial 
Bujagali Hydropower Project in Uganda, a recently leaked report of the World Bank's 
Inspection Panel confirms that the project could become another World Bank &quot;white 
elephant.&quot; NGOs are calling for a delay in the World Bank Board vote until: 
(1) the Inspection Panel report is made public; (2) the Power Purchase Agreement 
between the Government of Uganda and the project sponsor, the AES Corporation 
of Arlington, Virginia, is publicly released; and (3) concerns about the economic 
viability and environmental and social impacts of the project are addressed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Monday, June 17, the World Bank's Executive Board is scheduled to meet with 
the Inspection Panel to discuss its report on Bujagali. The Inspection Panel report 
raises serious concerns that the project may not be economically viable. Under 
the still-secret Power Purchase Agreement, the Government of Uganda will guarantee 
the dollar returns of AES, which could leave Uganda mired even deeper in foreign 
debt. The Panel report calls for the public release of the Power Purchase Agreement 
to allow an informed decision by the people who will bear the costs and risks 
of the project. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Tuesday, June 18, the Board of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA)-- the little-known division of the World Bank Group that provides political 
risk insurance to corporations that invest in developing countries--will consider 
a last-minute request to insure the project. While the project already has secured 
financing from the World Bank Group's International Development Association, and 
its private sector lending arm, the International Finance Corporation, concerns 
have arisen over AES's ability to finance the project because its stock value 
has fallen precipitously in the wake of the Enron debacle. Support from export 
credit agencies and other investors hinges on MIGA's decision.</font></p>
