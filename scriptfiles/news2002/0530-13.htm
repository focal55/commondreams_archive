- May 30 - The federal rule issued today giving auto manufacturers the choice of installing one of two types of tire pressure monitoring systems is inadequate and perpetuates a fraud on consumers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) earlier had proposed a stronger rule that would better protect consumers. We are deeply disappointed that the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) unwisely overruled NHTSA.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Proper tire pressure is critical. When tire pressure is low, tires experience more wear and tear, which can lead tires to fail. Congress required NHTSA to issue a tire pressure rule requiring manufacturers to equip vehicles with systems that enable consumers to know when their tires are underinflated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After receiving nearly 200 comments and holding at least 20 meetings, NHTSA recommended the installation of a &quot;direct&quot; system, which monitors the pressure of all four tires even when the car is stopped and provides drivers with comprehensive and accurate information. &quot;Indirect&quot; systems, which can be installed only in vehicles with anti-lock brakes, measure differences in the rotational speed of tires. They do not work if all four tires are equally underinflated or if the vehicle is not moving.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new regulation gives manufacturers a choice of installing either a direct or indirect system. This will provide consumers with fewer safety benefits. Companies likely will install the indirect system as standard equipment because it is cheaper, allowing them to charge a high mark-up for the superior direct systems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because this standard is wholly inadequate, Public Citizen intends to sue NHTSA to force it to adopt a rule that better protects the public.</font></p>
