- July 25 - The Marijuana Policy Project, in conjunction with Students for Sensible 

Drug Policy, will hold its first national conference November 8-10 in Anaheim, 

California. The conference will feature a variety of celebrity guests, including 

comedian Bill Maher, the outspoken host of ABC's recently canceled &quot;Politically 

Incorrect.&quot;</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Many speakers will focus on the November general election, which will occur 

just three days prior. &quot;This will be a hugely important election year for 

drug policy in general and marijuana policy in particular,&quot; said MPP Executive 

Director Robert Kampia. &quot;Nevada voters will decide whether or not to remove 

the threat of arrest for adults who use marijuana responsibly. A somewhat different 

marijuana initiative is likely to be on the ballot in Arizona, and medical marijuana 

will be voted on in Washington, D.C. Michigan and Ohio will decide on measures 

to provide treatment rather than jail for many nonviolent drug offenders, and 

South Dakota will consider the issue of industrial hemp -- a completely benign 

product caught up in `Drug War' hysteria.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This may well be the year that voters `just say no' to the cruelest, 

most harmful `Drug War' policies,&quot; Kampia added. &quot;With major changes 

already announced in England and under consideration in Canada, 2002 is likely 

to mark the beginning of the end of our nation's failed war on drugs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Numerous entertainment industry notables are expected to attend. Maher will 

speak at a special benefit for MPP and SSDP, joined by John Fugelsang, known for 

his appearances on &quot;America's Funniest Home Videos&quot; and on VH1. Also 

confirmed are actor and singer Michelle Phillips, who first rose to fame as a 

member of the Mamas and the Papas, and producer Aaron Russo, whose films -- including 

&quot;Trading Places&quot; and &quot;The Rose&quot; -- have garnered six Academy 

Award nominations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Marijuana Policy Project works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana 

-- both the consumption of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit 

such use. MPP believes that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. 

To this end, MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with 

a particular emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill 

people who have the approval of their doctors. For more information, please visit
