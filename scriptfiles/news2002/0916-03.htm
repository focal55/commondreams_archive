- September 16 - Interviews are available with members of a U.S. delegation to 

Iraq sponsored by the Institute for Public Accuracy. Members of the delegation 

met with Tariq Aziz and other Iraqi officials over the weekend.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a story in the Washington Post today entitled &quot;Congressman Sees Hope 

For Return of Inspectors: Bush's Call for Ousting Hussein Cited as Obstacle,&quot; 

the Post reports that &quot;[Rahall said] there was a 'strong possibility' Iraq 

would agree to unrestricted U.N. weapons inspections if President Bush backed 

down from his call for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to be replaced.... Meetings 

this weekend with senior Iraqi officials, including the deputy prime minister 

and a speaker of the national assembly, left him with the impression that Hussein's 

government was 'very interested' in allowing inspectors to return unconditionally 

but wanted diplomats from countries other than the United States to serve as independent 

arbiters of disputes between Iraq and the U.N. inspection commission.... The deputy 

prime minister, Tariq Aziz, insisted Saturday that even if his government readmitted 

the weapons inspectors, the United States and Britain would proceed with military 

action. 'It's doomed if you do, doomed if you don't,' he said.&quot;</font></p>

Executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, Solomon said today: &quot;During 

our meeting with Aziz, it was clear he felt that even if Iraq fully complied with 

the weapons inspectors, the administration would try to find some other pretext 

for a massive military assault.... One of the concerns the Iraqi government has 

is that unless there are safeguards that the inspectors will not be spies, then 

the Iraqis would be better off not letting them in at all. The fear is that if 

inspectors functioning as spies were let in, then U.S. military officials would 

end up with more information about sites to attack.&quot;</font></p>
