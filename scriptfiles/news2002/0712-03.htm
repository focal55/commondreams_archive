- July 12 - News Advisory: </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) 
and Georgetown Law Professor David Cole join Alliance for Justice President Nan 
Aron and hundreds of summer interns to kick-off First Monday 2002: Civil Liberties 
In a New America at the Capitol City Brewing Company on Tuesday, July 16. Since 
1994, the Alliance for Justice has organized an annual First Monday campaign to 
bring attention to critical public policy issues, uniting student activists on 
college, university, and law school campuses nationwide to fight for social justice. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 2002 First Monday campaign 
will explore Civil Liberties in a New America. Since the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, the government has taken actions -- in the name of security -- that 
threaten to erode the Constitutional protections and civil liberties on which 
our nation's justice system is based. History has shown, however, that scaling 
back civil liberties has proven more damaging than effective. First Monday 2002 
will work with students and activists around the country to organize hundreds 
of events on Oct. 7 focusing on civil liberties on college campuses, law and graduate 
schools, and communities. As part of First Monday each year, the Alliance for 
Justice produces a documentary film that students and activists will use for their 
events, such as campus-based educational meetings, citywide screenings, community 
forums, and ongoing organizing efforts by activists and advocates. This year's 
film will explore the effects of the USA Patriot Act and other government actions 
on civil liberties. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First Monday coincides with 
the opening of the Supreme Court's session on the first Monday in October -- this 
year on Oct. 7. Past campaigns have explored housing and homelessness, the death 
penalty and gun violence. </font></p>
