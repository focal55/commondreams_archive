- May 3 - </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SHEILA COLLINS, <a href="mailto:njfac@nccusa.org">njfac@nccusa.org</a>, <a href="http://www.njfac.org" target="_new">http://www.njfac.org<br>

</a>Professor of political science at William Paterson University in New Jersey 

and a member of the National Jobs for All Coalition executive committee, 

Collins is coauthor of &quot;Washington's New Poor Law: Welfare 'Reform' and the 

Roads Not Taken, 1935 to the Present.&quot; She said Friday afternoon: &quot;The 

official rate announced today is 6 percent. That's 8.6 million people, up 

by half a million people since last month. The official numbers grossly 

understate the number of unemployed and underemployed people. There are 4 

million people who only work part-time because they cannot find full-time 

work and another 4.5 million who have become so discouraged that they have 

stopped looking for work. If President Bush's thrust on welfare is to push 

more people into the low-wage labor market, that will further increase the 

number of unemployed and underemployed people.&quot;</font>

</a>Professor of economics at Emmanuel College in Boston and author of the 

forthcoming book &quot;Money Illusion,&quot; Frank said today: &quot;Last week the 

Commerce Department reported above-average GDP growth, leading people to 

think the recession had ended. April's unemployment figures show that the 

U.S. economy is still quite fragile. The employment numbers should serve as 

a reminder that policy-makers need to focus on the economic plight of 

actual people, rather than on fluctuations in aggregate GDP numbers that we 

don't fully understand. Whether we call it a recession or not, 6 percent 

unemployment has real economic consequences. In the late 1990s, low 

unemployment rates allowed U.S. workers to achieve substantial gains in 

income, after nearly 15 years of declines in [real] wages and job security. 

A return to 6 percent unemployment rates will likely reverse those gains...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WILLIAM SPRIGGS, <a href="mailto:wspriggs@nul.org">wspriggs@nul.org</a>, <a href="http://www.nul.org" target="_new">http://www.nul.org</a><br>

Director of the National Urban League Institute for Opportunity and 

Equality, Spriggs said: &quot;Today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced 

the Black unemployment rate jumped to 11.2 percent, the third straight 

month of increases. It is a full three percentage points higher than it was 

in April 2001. The unemployment rate for Hispanics increased to 7.9 

percent, also the third straight month of increases, though it is only 1.6 

percentage points higher than April of last year. The unemployment rate for 

women who serve as the household breadwinner now stands at 8.6 percent, up 

2.3 percentage points from last year. The share of long-term unemployed, 

those who have been unemployed over 27 weeks, is now up to 17.6 percent of 

the unemployed. So, not surprisingly, the average length of unemployment 

has now risen to 16.6 weeks, a full four weeks longer than one year ago. 

Despite rapid growth in the economy for the first quarter, as recently 

reported by the Commerce Department, the report today clearly shows the 

labor market lagging behind.... The [welfare] legislation that just cleared 

the House Education and Workforce and Ways and Means Committees does not 

reflect a need to adjust that program to changes in the labor market. 

Clearly, with 1.6 million fewer jobs in the economy this April than last, 

the current political posturing of increasing work requirements looks like 

Washington politics as usual -- removed from the realities of people's lives.&quot;</font></p>
