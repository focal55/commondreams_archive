<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - May 16 - One week after the 

Ashcroft Justice Department formally adopted the National Rifle 

Association (NRA) view that the Second Amendment guarantees a broad 

individual right to keep and bear arms, the defense team for 

accused American Taliban terrorist John Walker Lindh has used the 

government's arguments made to the U.S. Supreme Court to urge 

dismissal of the gun charge filed against him. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Justice Department position, announced last week in briefs 

filed with the U.S. Supreme Court, is contrary to both Supreme 

Court precedent and long-standing and consistent bipartisan Justice 

Department policy that the Second Amendment protects a 

militia-based -- not an expansive individual -- right to bear arms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Violence Policy Center (VPC) Litigation Director and Legislative 

Counsel Mathew Nosanchuk states, &quot;We warned of this inevitable 

result and it has not taken long for our fears to come true. The 

Ashcroft Justice Department has betrayed its law enforcement 

responsibilities by strengthening the legal position of those 

charged with committing serious crimes. These are the real-life 

consequences of a cynical, politically motivated action. Now 

defendants charged with a gun crime will argue the NRA-endorsed, 

Ashcroft- implemented, American Taliban defense. The 

tough-on-crime rhetoric of President Bush, Attorney General 

Ashcroft, and the NRA means little now that they have given accused 

gun criminals a new Justice Department-endorsed defense.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Violence Policy Center warned of the clear threat to public 

health and safety posed by the Justice Department shift in a May 2 

letter sent to Solicitor General Ted Olson by former Deputy 

Solicitor General Andrew Frey on behalf of the VPC before the 

briefs were filed. The letter stated: &quot;Prosecuting gun crimes 

would also be made more difficult in the wake of a policy change by 

the government....A person accused of violating one or more of 

these statutes will have the opportunity to make the argument that 

he was merely exercising his Second Amendment right at the time of 

his arrest, and that any statute purporting to impose criminal 

penalties for that conduct is unconstitutional....The ability of 

the United States to perform its task of defending the laws enacted 

by the Congress will be needlessly, and perhaps seriously, 

compromised by a filing of the sort we here urge you to avoid.&quot; </font></p>
