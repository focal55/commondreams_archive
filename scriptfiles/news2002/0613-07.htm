- June 13 - Buoyed by results from a new national Zogby poll showing that voters 
overwhelmingly want Congress to let District voters enact protection for medical 
marijuana patients without interference, the Marijuana Policy Project today began 
gathering signatures for the Medical Marijuana Initiative of 2002. 17,000 valid 
signatures must be turned in by July 8.</font>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is the initiative that wouldn't die,&quot; said MPP Executive Director 
Robert Kampia. &quot;Four years ago District voters supported protecting medical 
marijuana patients by a margin of 69 percent to 31 percent, but drug war ideologues 
led by Congressman Bob Barr have fought relentlessly to stop us from exercising 
our democratic rights. First they tried to keep the votes from being counted, 
and they lost. Then they blocked the measure from taking effect, but that wasn't 
enough: They even tried to deny District residents the right to vote on the issue 
ever again -- and they lost again. This is the beginning of the final battle: 
We will win because protecting patients is the right thing to do and because the 
public is overwhelmingly behind us.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Kampia -- joined at today's signature drive kickoff by Candida Fraze, plaintiff 
in MPP's successful lawsuit to overturn the Barr Amendment (which prohibited D.C. 
residents from voting on medical marijuana), and D.C. Councilmember Jim Graham 
-- noted that the political atmosphere has changed dramatically since Congress 
first quashed the District's medical marijuana law. In a new national Zogby poll 
released today, 62.5 percent of registered voters said that Congress should allow 
the medical marijuana initiative to take effect without interference, while only 
24.1 percent said Congress should block the measure.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This initiative will pass by a huge margin, just like it did in 1998,&quot; 
Kampia said. &quot;The message from the Zogby poll is clear: Congress should respect 
democracy and let District voters decide. What is remarkable about these results 
is how broad the support is: Voters in every region, every age group, every religious 
group, every income bracket, and every political affiliation -- including Republicans 
and conservatives -- agree. Members of Congress who ignore such overwhelming sentiment 
are risking trouble at the polls.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Zogby International conducted 
interviews of 1,012 registered voters chosen at random nationwide. All calls were 
made from Zogby International headquarters in Utica, New York, from Friday, June 
7, to Sunday, June 9, 2002. The survey has a margin of sampling error of &plusmn;3.2%. 
Margins of error are higher among subgroups. Slight weights were applied to region, 
age, party, race, religion, and gender to more accurately reflect the voting population.

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <i>The Marijuana Policy 
Project works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption 
of marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. MPP believes 
that the greatest harm associated with marijuana is imprisonment. To this end, 
MPP focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use, with a particular 
emphasis on making marijuana medically available to seriously ill people who have 
the approval of their doctors. For more information please visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org" target="_new">http://www.mpp.org</a>

Question: This November, voters in the city of Washington, D.C. will have an opportunity 
to vote on a medical marijuana ballot initiative similar to the laws now in force 
in eight states. If the voters of D.C. pass the medical marijuana initiative, 
should Congress accept the decision of the voters and allow the local law to take 
effect, or should Congress overturn the decision of Washington, D.C. voters?</font></p>
