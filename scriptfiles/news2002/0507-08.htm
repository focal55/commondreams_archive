- May 7 - Michael D. Barnes,

president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, today

blasted U.S. Attorney General Ashcroft's official reversal of the

United State's long-standing position on the Second Amendment. The

new position -- which was included as a footnote in two U.S.

Department of Justice (DOJ) briefs that were filed with the U.S.

Supreme Court on Monday, May 6 -- reflects Ashcroft's personal view

that the Second Amendment "broadly protects the rights of

individuals" to possess firearms. This directly contradicts the

Justice Department's position of more than 40 years that the Second

Amendment confers a collective right to bear arms in the context of

a state-sponsored militia.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"This action is proof positive that the worst fears about

Attorney General Ashcroft have come true: his extreme ideology on

guns has now become government policy," said Barnes. "His new

position represents a radical departure from the Justice

Department's unwavering interpretation of the Second Amendment

spanning at least four decades, an interpretation that has

prevailed in the U.S. Supreme Court and every federal appeals

court, with the sole exception of the renegade decision in U.S. v.

Emerson.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The Attorney General's actions will place strong gun laws at

risk by making them more difficult to defend. Indeed, the National

Rifle Association (NRA) has openly stated that it will use a

changed U.S. position to challenge the constitutionality of

common-sense gun laws. This action is a step backward in the fight

to prevent gun violence. It will only hinder efforts to defend and

enforce reasonable gun laws against attack by the extremist gun

lobby."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Department's new policy weakens the federal government's

defense of gun laws, to the benefit of the criminal defendants who

are challenging them. Incredibly, the Attorney General has

directed U.S. Attorneys across the nation to refrain from making

the strongest argument available in defense of those laws against

Second Amendment attack; that is, that the Second Amendment confers

a collective right to bear arms in the context of a state-sponsored

militia.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The militia interpretation is the view expressed by every

federal circuit except the Fifth Circuit, yet Justice Department

attorneys are henceforth barred from making that argument.

Instead, the Justice Department now will invite federal judges to

make their own judgments about whether the gun law at issue is

"reasonable." As seen in the Emerson case, Judge Sam Cummings, a

federal district court judge, did not think it reasonable to bar

Timothy Joe Emerson from possessing guns, even though Emerson had

threatened his wife and child with a pistol, owned an arsenal of

weapons, and had a domestic violence restraining order against him.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background:

The U.S. Supreme Court, and every federal appeals court in the

country, except one, has consistently rejected the gun lobby's

ill-founded attempt to read the militia clause out of the Second

Amendment. As the Supreme Court concluded more than 60 years ago,

in United States v. Miller (1939), the 'obvious purpose' of the

Second Amendment was 'to assure the continuation of and render

possible the effectiveness' of the state militia, and it 'must be

interpreted and applied with that end in view.'

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For decades, the NRA and others opposed to common-sense gun laws

have waged a campaign of misinformation, claiming that their

"individual rights" interpretation of the Second Amendment

invalidates many gun control measures. In 1991, former Chief

Justice Warren Burger called the gun lobby's deception "one of the

greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word 'fraud,' on the

American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in

my lifetime."</font></p>
