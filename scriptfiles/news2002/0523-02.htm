Senate Must First Address Future Harmful Pesticides and Chemicals</font></div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON   - May 23 - The Sierra Club today asked Senators to take a major step

towards protecting families and wildlife around the world from dangerous

chemicals.  On the International Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)

Elimination Day of Action, the Senate is poised to help rid the planet of

harmful chemicals and pesticides that can cause a variety of health

ailments from reproductive disorders to harming nervous system development.

Congress must not only approve the Stockholm Convention that the Bust

Administration has signed, it must also assure that such dangerous

chemicals can be quickly and efficiently eliminated in the future.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These chemicals are among the most poisonous substances humans created,&quot;

said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.  &quot;They can cause

brain damage and cancer, impair the immune system, interfere with hormones,

and produce genetic mutations which can be passed to our children.  We are

hopeful that the Senate will work to get these poisons out of our air,

water and food as quickly as possible.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate is poised to ratify the Stockholm Convention on Persistent

Organic Pollutants treaty, which phases out twelve of the worst pesticides

and industrial chemicals and provides a process to add other dangerous

chemicals to the treaty in the future. But Congress must also develop

methods for dealing with chemicals that are added to the POPS treaty in the

future.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT) has proposed a measure to eliminate the use of

future POPs. Senator Jeffords' measure allows the Environmental Protection

Agency to add future chemicals to the Stockholm Convention without chemical

by chemical Congressional approval. The Bush administration has also

proposed a plan for dealing with POPs, but the Administration's approach

would drastically slow down the process by requiring an act of Congress

before the United States can act on new POPs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POPs remain in the environment long after their release. Generally released

to the air, POPs end up in our lakes, rivers, and seas, in the soil and

plant life, and, ultimately, in the food chain.  POPs are produced either

as products (like pesticides), or as by-products (like dioxins) when

medical, industrial, or municipal wastes are burned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Stockholm Convention on POPs calls for outright banning and destruction

of these dangerous chemicals. The treaty is designed to eliminate or

severely restrict production and use of these very dangerous pesticides and

industrial chemicals; ensure environmentally sound management or

destruction of POPs waste and stockpiles; and prevent the emergence of new

chemicals with POPs-like characteristics. The treaty also commits

participating countries to provide developing countries with significant

financial and technical support so that they can successfully implement

treaty provisions.
