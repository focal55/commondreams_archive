YORK - July 23 - Today's Israel Defense Forces air strike on a crowded Gaza apartment 

building demonstrated a clear failure to take all feasible precautions to avoid 

civilian casualties, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch condemned 

the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirteen civilians were reported killed and some 140 injured in the attack. 

At least eight of the civilians killed were children. The intended target, Hamas 

military leader Salah al-Shahada, was also killed, as another Hamas member reportedly 

was.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;An attack that killed thirteen civilians and injured scores was clearly 

not carried out in a manner that minimized casualties. It should never have gone 

ahead,&quot; said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North 

Africa division of Human Rights Watch. &quot;In such a crowded civilian area, 

these deaths and injuries were absolutely foreseeable.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Israeli media reports, both Defense Minister Benyamin Ben-Eliezer 

and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon approved the operation, in which a United States-supplied 

F-16 aircraft fired a missile into a residential apartment building in the al-Daraj 

area of Gaza City. Gaza is one of the world's most densely populated areas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The operation was part of the Israeli government's policy of assassinating 

individuals it considers responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians and 

military targets. Human Rights Watch has criticized Israel's &quot;liquidation&quot; 

policy as a form of killing in circumstances when the suspect could have been 

arrested. Human Rights Watch has on numerous occasions condemned Palestinian attacks 

targeting civilians as violations of international law.</font></p>
