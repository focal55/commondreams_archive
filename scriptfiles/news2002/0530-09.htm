Not to Reopen Soft Money Loophole</div>

- May 30 - FEC Watch, a project of the Center for Responsive Politics, is calling on the Federal Election Commission to reject rules it has proposed that threaten to reopen the soft money loophole that was closed in recent campaign finance reform legislation, and to replace them with rules consistent with the law's intent.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In comments filed yesterday with the commission, FEC Watch charged that the FEC would allow huge amounts of unlimited &quot;soft money&quot; back into federal elections if several of its proposed rules for implementing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act were implemented.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reform bill's major provision is a ban on soft money, which the parties are not supposed to use to influence the outcome of federal elections but often spend on so-called &quot;issue ads&quot; that have the effect of endorsing or opposing a candidate. The Democrats and Republicans in 2000 raised close to $500 million in soft money, which can be contributed in unlimited amounts from a variety of sources.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The FEC's job is to enact regulations that most effectively implement the law,&quot; wrote CRP executive director Larry Noble and FEC Watch director Paul Sanford in their comments to the FEC's proposed rules. &quot;In so doing, the Commission must remain focused on the touchstone of the legislation ... [that] only money raised under the limits and prohibitions of the federal campaign finance laws can be spent to influence federal elections.&quot;</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FEC Watch's main concerns include the following:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FEC would have the law apply only to campaign committees formed after the law goes into effect this November, allowing hundreds of such committees that currently exist to continue raising soft money.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FEC's very narrow definition of who constitutes an &quot;agent&quot; of a candidate or political party would create a major loophole by allowing representatives of a federal candidate or political party to raise soft money.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The FEC would narrow the statutory definition of what it means to &quot;promote, support, attack or oppose&quot; a candidate, thereby opening the door for state and local parties to use soft money for activities that the new law requires them to pay for with limited, regulated funds.<br>

<br>

</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> FEC proposals would allow state and local parties to use exclusively soft money for expenses that currently require a mix of regulated (hard) money and soft money.</font></li>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fines for Late Filers</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other news, FEC Watch is seeking to delay an FEC action that could discourage candidates from filing timely campaign finance reports and weaken the system of campaign finance disclosure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In comments filed with the commission this week, FEC Watch urged commissioners not to implement proposed new rules that would reduce the fines levied against candidates who file their campaign finance reports late, or who fail to file at all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The comments, submitted by CRP executive director Larry Noble and FEC Watch director Paul Sanford, cite FEC statistics showing that the current system of fines has proven effective since its implementation in 1999. While 24 percent of campaign committees filed late reports in 1998, only 11 percent did so in 2000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noble and Sanford said the FEC must show that reducing the fines would not weaken the incentive for candidates to file on time. &quot;The Commission should not reduce fines unless it can be assured that the reduced fines will serve as an adequate incentive to committees to file timely reports,&quot; they wrote.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The comments also charged that the FEC has not proven claims outlined in its notice of proposed rulemaking that the fines for some campaign committees are too high. FEC Watch has filed a Freedom Of Information Act request with the FEC for documents providing evidence of such claims.</font></p>
