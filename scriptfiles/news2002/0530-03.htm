<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 30 - Frustrated by &quot;foot 

dragging&quot; by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a coalition 

of health and environmental groups today announced they'll take 

legal action to prod EPA to enforce new national health standards 

for ozone, or smog. In addition to taking their case to court, the 

groups also indicated that they would begin pressing EPA publicly 

to do its share in helping state and local governments to lower 

harmful levels of smog by adopting federal emission standards for 

some of the key sources of smog such as diesel-powered construction 

and industrial equipment, and power plants. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups, including the American Lung Association, Sierra 

Club, Environmental Defense and Natural Resources Defense Council, 

said they plan to sue EPA to force the agency to begin implementing 

the ozone standard adopted by the agency nearly five years ago. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As we enter the summer smog season, it's high time for EPA to 

stop foot dragging and take prompt action to protect our health 

from the dangers of smog,&quot; said John L. Kirkwood, president and 

chief executive officer of the American Lung Association </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a first step, Kirkwood called on EPA to formally identify 

parts of the nation with unhealthful air quality. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;EPA has said it may wait until 2004 to take this step,&quot; noted 

Marti Sinclair of the Sierra Club. &quot;That's just not acceptable. 

Every year of delay means more suffering for our families.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ozone standard was strengthened in 1997 in response to a 

compelling body of scientific evidence that the nation's children 

and other vulnerable groups suffer harmful health effects from 

exposure to ozone levels present today in many communities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The medical evidence demonstrating that smog is a threat to 

public health has only become stronger in the past five years since 

the smog standard was adopted by EPA,&quot; said Joe Goffman with 

Environmental Defense. &quot;Recent studies have linked high ozone 

levels to school absences, asthma attacks and decreased lung 

function in children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA itself has found that more than 120 million people live in 

areas with unhealthful ozone levels. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John D. Walke, director of the Clean Air Program at the Natural 

Resources Defense Council noted that enforcement of the standards 

had been delayed by lawsuits filed by big polluters including the 

coal, oil, chemical, trucking and electric power industries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But the Supreme Court unanimously rejected industry's arguments 

in February 2001,&quot; Walke noted. &quot;And last March a federal appeals 

court shot down remaining legal challenges to the standards.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Walke added that EPA needs to &quot;supply prompt and clear legal 

guidance to the states so they can begin devising appropriate 

clean-up strategies.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;EPA has successfully defended the 1997 smog standards in a 

marathon industry lawsuit that went all the way to the Supreme 

Court and back,&quot; said Howard Fox, Earthjustice attorney. &quot;That 

victory will mean little, however, if the agency leaves the new 

standard on the shelf, instead of getting states started on the 

cleanup required by law. The 120 million Americans who live in 

areas with unhealthy ozone levels deserve no less.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust noted that while state 

and local governments have primary responsibility to develop plans 

to achieve the standards, the federal government can help. He 

noted that EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to devise a 

new multi-state plan to reduce smog-forming emissions from electric 

power plants. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;EPA also should move promptly to close the dirty diesel 

loophole that permits diesel-powered construction equipment to emit 

more pollution than diesel trucks and buses,&quot; he added. </font></p>
