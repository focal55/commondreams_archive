- July 2 - A coalition of union members, retirees, workers with disabilities and 
survivors began a campaign today to educate the public about cuts in future Social 
Security benefits that would be forced by President Bush's plans to privatize 
America's most important family protection program. The coalition demanded that 
elected officials and candidates make clear to the public their position on privatizing 
Social Security.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson spoke from San Antonio, 
Texas, today on the impact of privatization for Texas. Chavez-Thompson led the 
coalition in demanding that lawmakers and candidates in Texas pledge publicly 
to reject Social Security privatization. &quot;Nearly 50 million people in America 
rely on Social Security today, and many more who are working now will rely on 
it in the future. Before working people vote in November, they deserve straight 
answers from politicians about their plans for Social Security,&quot; said Chavez-Thompson.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 2001, President Bush created a commission charged with coming up with 
plans to convert at least part of Social Security into a system of private investment 
accounts. The commission released plans in December 2001 that would pay for privatizing 
Social Security by drastically cutting the program's guaranteed benefits for workers 
with disabilities, survivors and retirees, even if a worker chose to stay with 
a traditional Social Security plan. The plans also tap more than $1 trillion from 
the federal budget to pay for private accounts. Although the president and several 
Republicans ran on a 2000 campaign promise to privatize Social Security, Republican 
candidates this year have been advised to keep the plan to privatize Social Security 
quiet until after the November congressional elections, according to campaign 
documents.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As part of the campaign to educate the public, the Texas AFL-CIO released an 
analysis based on data from a national study by independent economists Peter A. 
Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Peter R. Orzag of the 
Brookings Institution on how much privatization would cut future benefits for 
Texas residents. From July though November, state union leaders will highlight 
the impact of privatization on residents of their states and insist that officials 
sign the pledge to reject privatization.</font></p>
