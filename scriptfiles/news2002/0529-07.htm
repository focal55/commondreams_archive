- May 29 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed a federal lawsuit today to stop a public school in St. Albans, West Virginia, from including school-sponsored prayer at its graduation ceremony.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;School officials have absolutely no business promoting religion at an official school event,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United. &quot;Public school events must remain religiously neutral to protect the rights of everyone.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The school district in Kanawha County, West Virginia, has a policy that allows students to vote on including prayer at school graduation ceremonies. The prayers are supposed to be &quot;non-sectarian&quot; and &quot;non-proselytizing,&quot; and must be approved by school principals before the event.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lawsuit challenges the county's policy and seeks to block graduation prayer at St. Albans High School. The Deveny v. Kanawha suit was filed on behalf of a graduating senior who objects to the coercive religious practice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Students should not be pressured or coerced to pray at an official event, even if a majority of students votes to do so,&quot; Lynn added. &quot;The school may think school-promoted prayer offers a good lesson; in fact, it only teaches students contempt for the Constitution and minority views.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lynn rejected the idea that the graduation prayer policy is merely about allowing the free exercise of religion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If students want to pray during a graduation ceremony, that's up to them,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;This isn't about stopping voluntary worship, it's about making sure that everyone feels welcome at public school events.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This policy allows the state to promote the prayer of the majority at an official public school event, while telling the minority, 'too bad,'&quot; Lynn added. &quot;At its core, that amounts to state-sponsored tyranny of the majority. If that isn&#146;t in conflict with the First Amendment, I don't know what is.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AU's Legal Director, Ayesha Khan, who is serving as lead counsel in the case, noted that the Supreme Court dealt with a similar case just two years ago. In that case, the justices struck down a policy that called for students to vote on whether to include a student-led prayer at home football games.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Supreme Court has already ruled that students cannot vote to include prayers at school events,&quot; Khan said. &quot;The Kanawha County School Board is flagrantly violating that ruling.&quot;</font></p>
