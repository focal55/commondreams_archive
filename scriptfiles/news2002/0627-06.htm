- June 27 - Today's Supreme Court decision upholding a Cleveland religious school 
voucher program shifts the battle over this issue from the courts to the state 
legislatures and Congress, according to Americans United for Separation of Church 
and State.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This battle is not over; it's just starting,&quot; said the Rev. Barry 
W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United, one of the organizations that 
brought the challenge to Cleveland's voucher program before the high court. &quot;This 
is a sad day for religious liberty and public education in America, but it does 
not spell the end of either.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn said the court's 5-4 ruling was &quot;the worst church-state ruling in 
50 years,&quot; but added that supporters of the First Amendment and quality education 
can stop the mistake from spreading across the country.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is a wake-up call to taxpayers,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The Supreme 
Court thinks it's all right to force taxpayers to put their money in the coffers 
of religious schools. If Americans don't give their state legislators and members 
of Congress an earful, they may soon be paying taxes to support religious indoctrination.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn noted that supporters of voucher schemes will likely use this ruling to 
encourage lawmakers nationwide to pass laws to force taxpayers to support religious 
schools.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America, watch your wallet or it may end up in a collection plate,&quot; 
Lynn said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn pointed out that the court, by upholding vouchers in the Zelman v. Simmons-Harris 
case, has not mandated that states offer voucher subsidies to religious schools. 
Rather, the justices have thrown the issue to Congress and the state legislatures 
to decide. He vowed that Americans United will redouble its efforts to fight voucher 
proposals and to keep them from becoming law.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Americans United and allied organizations will do whatever it takes to 
see that taxpayers are not forced to support religious schools,&quot; Lynn vowed. 
&quot;Civil liberties activists, public school advocates and progressive religious 
leaders will not take this misguided decision lying down.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn said that despite the high court's ruling, there are many reasons to reject 
voucher schemes, among them:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Vouchers do not spur academic improvement. Objective studies of existing 
voucher programs in the country have shown little or no academic improvement for 
voucher students.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Many state constitutions contain strict prohibitions on public aid for religious 
institutions. While the Supreme Court has ruled on the legality of vouchers in 
relation to the federal Constitution, lawmakers nationwide will still need to 
consider state law. The majority of states have constitutions that strictly limit 
any public aid for religious ministries.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Members of minority groups do not support vouchers. In 2000, voters in California 
and Michigan voted on voucher proposals at the ballot box. Both were trounced 
-- 71 percent to 29 percent in California and 69 percent to 31 percent in Michigan. 
In California, polls showed that Hispanic voters were even more adamant in their 
rejection of the plan, voting 77 percent to 23 percent. African-American voters 
in California rejected vouchers 68 percent to 32 percent. In Michigan, blacks 
voted down vouchers 72 percent to 28 percent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* The general public does not support vouchers. According to a Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup 
poll released in August, when people were given the choice of moving to a voucher 
system or improving public education, 71 percent said they favor improving public 
education; only 27 percent opted for vouchers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Vouchers do not help poor families. Most vouchers are worth $1,500 to $3,000, 
yet private-school tuition can easily top $10,000 per year. Poor families would 
have no way to make up the difference. In Cleveland, a study showed that 33 percent 
of the families participating in the voucher plan had been sending their children 
to private schools before the program was implemented. Vouchers can easily end 
up becoming a subsidy for families who desire a private education at taxpayer 
expense.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* Vouchers detract from real school reform. Public education in some parts 
of the nation is troubled. Studies show what these schools need -- smaller class 
sizes and more resources. Vouchers detract from the goal of finding ways to give 
all students a quality education by offering a small number an opportunity to 
leave public schools. Ninety percent of American children attend public schools. 
Reform efforts must focus on helping everyone, not just a handful.</font></p>
