- July 24 - &quot;TakeBackBaseball.com,&quot; a grassroots group of baseball fans 

sick of greed destroying the game they love, today launched a petition drive calling 

on Major League Baseball owners to replace Bud Selig with a new, independent Commissioner 

-- one who can finally put an end to the ills threatening to ruin yet another 

baseball season. The move comes on the heels of the group's July 11 &quot;Fan 

Walkout Day,&quot; an effort which yielded it thousands of new members and coverage 

on national and international TV, including CNN. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's time for Bud Selig to 

Go,&quot; said Heather Holdridge, 'Team Captain' of the group. &quot;Major League 

Baseball is in chaos, the owners and players are about to torpedo another season, 

and the man presiding over it all is no All-Star. We can do better.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TakeBackBaseball asserted that firing 

Bud Selig, the owners' commissioner who has misled the US Congress and baseball 

fans time after time, is the first key step towards restoring integrity to the 

national pastime. Fans can sign the &quot;Bud Must Go&quot; petition at <a href="http://www.BudMustGo.com" target="_new">http://www.BudMustGo.com</a> 

or <a href="http://www.TakeBackBaseball.com" target="_new">http://www.TakeBackBaseball.com</a>, 

and learn more about other ways they can help reform the game TakeBackBaseball.com 

will deliver compiled petitions to the 30 Major League owners and Selig himself. 

Fans can also express their opinion as to who the Commissioner should be, choosing 

from several options, or filling in a choice of their own. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are telling the owners that 

it's high time for them to get an independent Commissioner,&quot; said John Hlinko, 

one of the group's 'Pitchers. &quot;One with the stature, reputation, and common 

sense to bring the sides together, one who really is impartial, and one who understands 

that THERE'S NO TYING IN BASEBALL!&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TakeBackBaseball.com also announced 

that it had gained momentum for a second &quot;Fan Walkout Day,&quot; to take 

place on August 1st. The group is specifically asking fans to sign a pledge to 

stay home from major league baseball games on August 1. Fans can pledge to take 

part in this strike by signing up at <a href="http://www.TakeBackBaseball.com" target="_new">http://www.TakeBackBaseball.com</a>.
