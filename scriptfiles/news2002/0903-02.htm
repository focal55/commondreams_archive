- September 3 - The World Resources Institute (WRI) today praised the Russian 

Federation&#8217;s commitment to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, clearing a major hurdle 

for this controversial climate treaty to come into force. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are happy that the Russian Federation and most of the world has now 

accepted binding rules on how to mitigate global climate change,&quot; said WRI 

president Jonathan Lash. &quot;This is a forward-looking decision by Russia and 

we are glad they stood their ground despite the pressure exerted by the Bush Administration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia&#8217;s commitment to ratify was announced today, the penultimate day 

of the on-going World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. It is 

the first time they have done so. The Kyoto Protocol, named after the city where 

it was negotiated, needs to be ratified by at least 55 parties to the treaty, 

including rich countries which contribute 55 percent of the world&#8217;s output 

of climate-changing carbon dioxide. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fate of the Kyoto Protocol has been hanging in the balance since U.S. president 

George W. Bush pulled out of the treaty, saying that it was flawed. Australia 

followed suit. As of Aug. 30, 2002, 89 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, 

including countries which account for 37.1 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. 

The Russian Federation contributes 17.4 percent of the world&#8217;s emissions, 

leaving only 0.5 percent before the treaty can come into full force. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I am sorry that the Bush Administration still refuses to recognize that 

global warming threatens our future security and that we can only stop it through 

global cooperation,&quot; said Lash. </font></p>
