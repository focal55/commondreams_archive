<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 2 - CAIR is calling on all people of conscience 

to contact House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX) to demand that he 

retract his call for ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. Last night 

on MSNBC's &quot;Hardball,&quot; host Chris Matthews had the following dialogue with 

Rep. Armey:</font>

<blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: I'm content to have Israel grab the entire West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATTHEWS: Well, where do you put the Palestinian state, in Norway? Once the 

Israelis take back the West Bank permanently and annex it, there's no place 

else for the Palestinians to have a state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: No, no, that's not--that's not at all true. There are many Arab 

nations that have many hundreds of thousands of acres of land and--and soil 

and property and opportunity to create a Palestinian state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATTHEWS: So you would transport--you would transport the Palestinians from 

Palestine to somewhere else and call it their state?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: I would be perfectly content to have a homeland, just as--most of...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATTHEWS: But not in Palestine?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: Most of the people who now populate Israel were transported from all 

over the world to that land and they made it their home. The Palestinians 

can do the same, and we're per--perfectly content to work with the 

Palestinians in doing that...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATTHEWS: Right, no. No, that's not the question and that's not your 

answer. The question here is: What is the future of the Palestinians who 

are fighting Israel right now? You say there future is somewhere besides 

Palestine. That runs in the way of US policy going back to 1948. It 

runs--it runs completely against the president's policy and every policy 

I've heard a president take, which is that Israel has to give up its 

settlements on the West Bank and give it back to the Arabs in exchange for 

peace. You say the deal should be the Palestinians leave?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: That's right...I happened to believe that the Palestinians should leave.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATTHEWS: Have you ever told George Bush, the president from your home 

state of Texas, that you think the Palestinians should get up and go and 

leave Palestine and that's the solution?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: I'm probably telling him that right now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATTHEWS: Well, just to repeat, you believe that the Palestinians who are 

now living on the West Bank should get out of there?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARMEY: Yes.</font></p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is beyond belief that Representative Armey would openly call for the 

ethnic cleansing of the entire Muslim and Christian Palestinian population, 

something that violates every norm of international law and human rights. 

Even the most extreme Israelis are reluctant to publicly advocate such an 

insane policy,&quot; said CAIR Governmental Affairs Director Jason Erb.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Erb demanded an immediate retraction and apology from Armey. He said CAIR 

has received many complaints about Armey's remarks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUESTED: (As always, be POLITE.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contact Rep. Armey to ask that he retract his call for ethnic cleansing and 

that he apologize for advocating a policy that would violate all norms of 

international law and human rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CONTACT:(A personal call is best, followed by a fax, followed by an e-mail 

message. Inform CAIR of what you are told, or how you are treated,  by 

Armey's staff.)</font></p>
