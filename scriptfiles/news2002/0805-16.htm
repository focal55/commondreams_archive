YORK - August 5 - Colombia today became the seventy-seventh country world-wide 

and the sixteenth Latin American and Caribbean nation to deposit its ratification 

of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Colombia's ratification 

occurs in the closing days of the presidency of Andres Pastrana and in the midst 

of a strategic US assault designed to undercut the efficacy of the new Court.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As a country whose recent history is fraught with terrible violence and 

conflicts between rebel groups, militia and state authorities, Colombia's ratification 

of the ICC treaty shows its commitment to ensuring justice and accountability 

for all,&quot; said William Pace, Convenor of the NGO Coalition for the International 

Criminal Court. &quot;We congratulate Colombia's leaders of Parliament and the 

Ministries, and especially President Pastrana for leaving this important legacy 

of peace.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">H. E. Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso, who deposited the Rome Statute at today's 

ceremony, said of Colombia's ratification, &quot;The ratification of this instrument 

is a very important step for us and demonstrates our commitment to strengthening 

international law.&quot; Reportedly, the Constitutional Court of Colombia held 

an extraordinary session in order to approve the ratification of the Rome Statute 

before the current government's term of office concludes on Wednesday, August 

7th.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US offensive against the new Court, the jurisdiction of which began this 

July 1st, includes the following actions to date this year: the May 6th renunciation 

of its signature of the Rome Statute, the July 12th adoption of a Security Council 

resolution granting US peacekeepers immunity from the jurisdiction of the Court 

for one year, the August 2nd presidential signature and enactment of a bill known 

as the &quot;Hague Invasion Act&quot; and the procurement of two Article 98 non-cooperation 

agreements. Article 98 agreements, which are being sought by US ambassadors in 

capitols around the world, were signed by Romania on August 1st and by Israel 

today, August 5th.</font></p>
