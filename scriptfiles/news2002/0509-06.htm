<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 9 -  The Center for Justice &amp; Democracy (CJ&amp;D), a national non-profit consumer group, announced today that their recent study of business surveys directly disputes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&#146;s $100,000 advertising and lobbying push, directed at Mississippi lawmakers who have rightly resisted enacting anti-consumer changes to the state&#146;s legal system.  The CJ&amp;D study challenges one of the most sensationalized fictions driving the &#147;tort reform&#148; movement today -- the notion that lawmakers must restrict the rights of injured consumers to sue in order for the state&#146;s business economy to grow or even survive. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CJ&amp;D Executive Director Joanne Doroshow, co-author of the study, Survey Says &#133; &#147;Tort Reform&#148; Not A Priority for Businesses said, &#147;If you listen to corporate lobbyists like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, they will tell you that lawsuits by consumers are creating economic &#145;crises&#146; that are driving out businesses, doctors and other professions.  They tell Mississippi lawmakers that &#145;tort reform&#146; legislation is needed for small businesses to survive and to attract new businesses to their state and, even more daunting, that unless &#145;tort reform&#146; is enacted, businesses and doctors leave.  This is pure fiction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Internal business surveys consistently show that when it comes to issues that are important for businesses and to a state&#146;s overall business climate, liability issues rank far below other matters of far more importance -- like workforce, healthcare and a range of tax and regulatory issues -- if they rank at all.  Moreover, liability laws are irrelevant factors to businesses deciding where to locate.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Report co-author Emily Gottlieb, CJ&amp;D Deputy Director, explained, &#147;We ranked states based on the number of major tort law limits enacted since 1985 and correlated those findings with the states that have built the most number of new facilities or plants.  We found there to be absolutely no connection between a state&#146;s enactment of &#145;tort reform&#146; and the state&#146;s relative attraction for businesses.&#148; </font></p>
