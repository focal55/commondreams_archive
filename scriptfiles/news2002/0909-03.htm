- September 9 - Cloaked in a mantle of “wildfire prevention,” legislation proposed 

by the White House on September 5, 2002, attempts to eviscerate key environmental 

and public participation laws that apply to the management of federal public lands. 

However, only the first of the four sections, flawed as it is, is specific to 

forest fire prevention. Among other things, this section seeks to eliminate the 

application of the National Environmental Policy Act and to interfere with, or 

flatly prohibit judicial review. The other three sections attempt fundamental 

changes in existing law by authorizing a new timber industry handout called “stewardship 

contracting,” eliminating the Forest Service appeal process established under 

the Appeals Reform Act of 1993, and even attempting to limit the authority of 

the federal courts to enjoin activities found to be illegal. Together, the Bush 

Administration’s “Healthy Forests” proposals constitute a radical revision of 

public lands law as it presently exists and provide an unprecedented opportunity 

for timber companies to gain access to federal timber, free of public scrutiny 

and legal restraints. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://ga0.org/campaign/lawlesslogging" target="_new">TAKE 

ACTION TO STOP LAWLESS LOGGING</a></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Lawless Logging</b></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 1. Emergency Hazardous Fuels Reduction Plan</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This section would apply to Forest Service and BLM projects “to reduce hazardous 

fuels” in any “fire risk condition class three area” except congressionally designated 

Wilderness. By its terms it would also apply to national parks and national wildlife 

refuges.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 1 seeks to exempt all projects “to reduce hazardous fuels” from the 

National Environmental Policy Act. Sec. 1(a). NEPA is the fundamental environmental 

law for all federal agencies, requiring that they look before they leap (or cut) 

by gathering information and analyzing the potential impacts of their decisions 

and actions on wildlife, water quality and the environment. It also requires the 

agency to consider alternative courses of action, to disclose the information 

and alternatives to the public through environmental assessments and impact statements, 

and to take into consideration comments from the public, state and local governments, 

Indian tribes and other federal agencies. Without an enforceable NEPA, the agency 

need not (and, based on our experience with the 1995 salvage rider), will not 

consider environmental impacts, alternatives, or the views of the public.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There is no effective limit on the land area potentially subject to this section. 

Although the bill states that no more than 10 million acres will be “treated,” 

it also provides that the agency may “treat” even more acres if the agency first 

classifies them as high fire risk areas. Sec. 1(c)(1), -(2).</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 1 directs the secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to develop 

a “collaborative process” with “interested parties” but exempts this process from 

the Federal Advisory Committee Act and from any court challenges. Sec. 1(d)(1), 

-(f)(2). This would insulate both departments from FACA’s requirement that there 

be a balanced representation of a variety of interests in such collaborative processes 

and from FACA’s public disclosure requirements.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This section also requires the departments to develop expedited consultation 

procedures for threatened and endangered species under the Endangered Species 

Act. Sec. 1(d)(2). This is likely to result in hastier reviews based on less complete 

data and fewer opinions and to increase the chances that timber sales will not 

adequately protect imperiled species. Further, these expedited consultation procedures, 

no matter how deficient, would be exempt from judicial review. Sec. 1(f)(2).</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The section would exempt all fuel reduction timber sales from the right of 

administrative appeal. Sec. 1(e). Administrative appeals provide members of the 

public with a short, efficient, and even lawyer-free means to get upper level 

agency officials to review agency decisions. They have been effective in ensuring 

that agency opinions comply with the law and reflect public policy. In fact, they 

have frequently resulted in an agency’s making important modifications to, or 

completely withdrawing, illegal decisions and thereby eliminating the need and 

expense of formal court proceedings. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Of great concern in Section 1 is the provision that attempts to prohibit federal 

courts from entering temporary restraining orders (TROs) or preliminary injunctions. 

Sec. 1(f)(1)(C). TROs and preliminary injunctions are orders traditionally within 

the power of the courts to prevent irreparable harm while a lawsuit is pending, 

e.g., an order that trees not be cut until the legality of the authorizing decision 

is determined. They are available only if the person bringing the lawsuit can 

show a likelihood of prevailing and that the action, if taken, is for all practical 

purposes irreversible. If courts are stripped of their powers to issue TROs and 

preliminary injunctions, it is very likely that the trees in question will be 

cut before a court can hear and decide whether cutting them is legal.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In summary, several provisions of Section 1 seek to make it impossible, or 

nearly impossible, for citizens to effectively enforce any environmental laws 

once the Forest Service or BLM has characterized an area as presenting a high 

risk of fire and designated the logging or other activity to be a fire reduction 

strategy. First, it attempts to exempt such projects from our most fundamental 

environmental law, NEPA. Second, it provides an unreviewable “collaborative process” 

to approve these projects with no assurance of balance. Third, it provides for 

hastened and quite possibly inadequate procedures for protecting threatened and 

endangered species, procedures that are also not subject to judicial review. Fourth, 

it eliminates administrative appeals. Fifth, it attempts to preclude the courts 

from issuing orders needed to prevent the trees from being cut while a lawsuit 

brought on any remaining grounds is decided.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Finally, as discussed further below, the bill makes it much more difficult 

for citizens to obtain a judicial remedy, i.e., a permanent injunction, even if 

they overcome all other obstacles the bill imposes. Under Section 4 it attempts 

to force the courts to allow even an illegal sale to go forward if the agency 

is still of the view that it should.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A License to Steal</b></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 2. Stewardship Contracting</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 2 provides federal land management agencies with sweeping new authority 

to enter into long-term “goods-for-services” contracts with “private persons, 

or other public or private entities” to perform a wide array of services, all 

using timber or other forest products as the medium of payment. In other words, 

a logging company can keep the timber.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This section proposes to trade trees for almost any activity, as the proposed 

contracting authority would be available to achieve any “land management goals 

for the national forests and other Federal lands.” Sec. 2(a). This contracting 

authority is not limited to fire prevention efforts or to lands presenting a high 

fire risk. Even the broad list of land management goals contained in Section 2(b) 

(“to promote healthy forests”) is merely presented as a list of possible suggestions. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 2 would remove the normal requirement that timber corporations to 

pay for timber sales in dollars. Instead, they would “pay” by conducting road 

work, cutting trees, etc., on the assumption that such activities conferred a 

benefit on the public. The bill explicitly makes clear that the collection of 

money is secondary to obtaining such services. Federal agencies already lose vast 

sums of money on timber sales. This program would make the situation much more 

difficult and accountability almost impossible.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Similarly, Section 2 would remove the normal requirement that timber sales 

be awarded to the highest bidder. Instead, the agency could consider such fudgeable 

factors as “the quality and quantity of products to be removed” or any other “unit 

of measurement appropriate to the contracts,” to be determined by the agency. 

Sec. 2(c)(3)(B).</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As to any money the agency may actually collect under these contracts, Section 

2 creates an off-budget slush fund for the agency. It authorizes the agency to 

spend the money with no further appropriations by Congress, removing the normal 

legislative oversight on agency spending. Sec. 2(d)(2)(A).</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Congress has previously authorized a limited pilot program to test 84 “stewardship” 

projects, only five of which have been completed. Moreover, there are only 30 

in any stage of planning or implementation. It would be reckless to provide the 

agencies this expansive new authority before we have even learned the lessons 

the pilot program is intended to test. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In summary, Section 2 holds out an irresistible temptation to timber companies 

to steal publicly owned timber. The value of the services will be inflated, assuming 

they are necessary at all, and the value of the timber will be underestimated. 

The proposal is similar to the controversial Purchaser Road Credit Program where 

the Forest Service was authorized to trade trees for the construction of logging 

roads needed by the timber industry to access timber sales. The PRC program is 

part of the reason the Forest Service ended up with over 386,000 miles of roads, 

including 294,000 miles of timber (logging) roads, in the first place. Congress 

eliminated this program in 1998.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Eliminating Meaningful Public Participation</b></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 3. Repeal</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 3 repeals the Appeals Reform Act that was enacted into law as part 

of the FY 1993 Interior Appropriations bill. Pub. L. 102-381. The Appeals Reform 

Act ensures that the public has the right to question decisions made by the Forest 

Service without going to court. Repealing this Act would eliminate specific statutory 

rights of meaningful public participation. The Appeals law also ensures that trees 

will not be cut while an appeal is pending unless the Forest Service determines 

that there is an emergency; in return, it requires that appeals be decided within 

45 days.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The appeals process is an informal one that does not require the participation 

of lawyers. It works quickly and efficiently, improves agency performance, protects 

the rights of all affected by Forest Service decisions, and helps ensure compliance 

with the law. It also provides an important opportunity for the Forest Service 

to take a second look at some projects and very often to avoid litigation. The 

repeal of the Appeals Reform Act would allow the Forest Service to eliminate the 

appeals process for all timber sales and other activities, not just those related 

to fire prevention.</font></font>

<p> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tilting the Scales of Justice</b></font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section 4. Balance of Short-term 

and Long-term Environmental Harms</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Section 4 attempts to make it much 

more difficult for courts to enter orders needed to protect the environment. It 

tries to require courts to give deference to an agency’s findings regarding the 

balance of harms in deciding whether to enter a temporary restraining order, preliminary 

injunction, or a permanent injunction in any court challenge where the agency 

claims the action is necessary to “restore fire-adapted forest or rangeland ecosystems.” 

In other words, this section applies not only to activities carried out under 

the fire plan (Sec. 1.) where TROs and preliminary injunctions are prohibited. 

Moreover, Section 4 asks the courts to give deference to the agencies when deciding 

whether to issue a permanent injunction against an activity even when that activity 

has already proven to be illegal. Essentially, the provision would have the courts 

license an agency to continue to operate in violation of the law, regardless of 

environmental harm. Section 4 seeks to legislate an astounding change in American 

legal standards that would fundamentally alter the relationship between citizens 

and federal land agencies.</font>
