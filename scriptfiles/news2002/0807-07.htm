- August 7 - A bill that would allow houses of worship to engage in partisan 

politicking will face a vote in the House of Representatives in early September, 

observers in Washington say.

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rep. Walter B. Jones' &quot;Houses of Worship Political Speech Protection Act&quot; 

(H.R. 2357) was drafted by attorneys with TV preacher Pat Robertson's American 

Center for Law and Justice and is being aggressively pushed by numerous Religious 

Right organizations. The measure would change the Internal Revenue Code to allow 

houses of worship to use personnel and resources to endorse or oppose candidates 

for public office.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Federal tax law currently forbids non-profit groups, including houses of worship, 

from intervening in partisan campaigns if they are tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) 

of the tax code. The Jones bill would lift that regulation -- but only for houses 

of worship. Religious Right groups are eager to get rid of the provision so they 

can draft churches as cogs in their political machines.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Americans do not want their churches turned into smoke-filled rooms where 

political deals are cut and partisan politics replaces worship,&quot; said the 

Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church 

and State. &quot;When people put their money in the collection plate, they don't 

expect it to be used for candidates' campaign literature and attack ads.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn continued, &quot;This bill threatens the integrity of the faith community 

and subverts the political process. It would be deeply divisive both for congregations 

and communities.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many Religious Right supporters of the legislation have said the bill is necessary 

to protect religious leaders' ability to speak out on issues. AU's Lynn said this 

argument is &quot;nonsense.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Religious leaders are already free to expose moral evils, propose ethical 

solutions and hold our leaders to the highest standards,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The 

only thing that tax law prohibits is intervention by tax-exempt groups in political 

campaigns.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Survey data shows that Americans are opposed to this legislation. A recent 

poll by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that 70 percent of the 

respondents said they disapprove of churches endorsing political candidates.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, the legislation has also been introduced in the Senate. On Aug. 

1, Sens. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 

unveiled S. 2886 to change federal tax law to allow &quot;churches and other houses 

of worship&quot; to engage in partisan politicking.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Religious leaders and organizations across the theological spectrum have announced 

opposition to the Jones bill. They include the American Jewish Committee; the 

American Jewish Congress; the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs; the Central 

Conference of American Rabbis; the Church of the Brethren Washington Office; the 

Friends Committee on National Legislation (Quakers); the General Board of Church 

and Society, United Methodist Church; the National Council of Churches of Christ 

in the USA; the Presbyterian Church (USA), Washington Office; Seventh-day Adventist 

Church, General Conference; Soka Gakkai International -- USA Buddhist Association; 

Union of American Hebrew Congregations; the Unitarian Universalist Association 

and the United Church of Christ Justice and Witness Ministries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn urged Americans United members to contact their representatives in the 

House and give their opinions about the Jones bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This country doesn't need partisan pulpits,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The 

Jones bill deserves to go down in defeat.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, 

D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance 

of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
