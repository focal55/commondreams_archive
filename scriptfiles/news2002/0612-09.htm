- June 12 - A new study delivered to Congress today starkly illustrates the need 
for a Medicare drug benefit program that enables the government to negotiate with 
drug makers for deep discounts, Public Citizen said today.</p> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The study, issued by the 
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), finds 
that Medicare is being significantly overcharged for medical supplies such as 
wheelchairs and saline solution. The study finds that if Medicare paid the same 
prices for 16 health care supplies as the Veterans Affairs Department (VA), which 
negotiates for low prices with manufacturers, it could have achieved discounts 
amounting to $958 million, or 56 percent of the cost of those products.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The lesson here for members 
of Congress drafting legislation to create a drug benefit in the Medicare program 
is clear," said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch. "Drug 
benefit legislation must give the Medicare program the ability to negotiate deep 
discounts in the price of drugs directly with drug makers. Any other proposal 
will result in Medicare being dramatically overcharged for drugs, making it impossible 
to come up with an affordable program."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Currently the VA negotiates 
deep discounts with manufacturers of medical supplies, including pharmaceuticals 
and durable medical equipment. These medical supplies are then made available 
to VA facilities and other federal government agencies at the agreed-to prices. 
Through negotiations with drug companies, the VA has been able to achieve discounts 
of approximately 50 percent off the retail price of prescription drugs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Rather than do the sensible, 
cost-effective thing and adopt the current drug cost containment program that 
saves 40 to 50 percent on the cost of drugs for the VA and other federal agencies, 
the Republican plan makes a modest gesture at cost-containment while making grandiose 
claims," Clemente said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Below is Public Citizen’s 
critique of the drug cost containment proposal that is expected to be included 
in the House Republican’s Medicare proposal next week:</font></p>
</font> 
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Republicans have 
claimed that their plan will allow Medicare to "use its purchasing power to negotiate 
drug discounts averaging 30 percent," it in fact fails to do so. In the most recent 
available version of the Republican proposal, there is no language allowing the 
HHS Secretary or the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
to negotiate deep discounts directly with the drug industry. Instead, this legislation 
would rely on private insurance plans and HMOs to provide a drug benefit to Medicare 
beneficiaries. These private plans would negotiate some discounts with drug companies, 
but they would not have the market power of the entire Medicare population behind 
them and therefore would be limited in the discounts they could achieve.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 30 percent drug discount 
claim is a distortion. The claim that their plan will produce "drug discounts 
of 30 percent" is based on a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate that has 
not been made public. However, judging from similar analyses by CBO that have 
been made public, it appears to be a distortion of CBO’s conclusions. In June 
2001, the CBO scored H.R. 4680, legislation very similar in structure to the most 
recent version of the Republican proposal. The CBO estimated that the legislation 
would result in a "cost management factor" of 30 percent. However, this is very 
different from Republican claims that their proposal will result in a "30 percent 
drug discount." The "cost management factor" referred to by CBO is the result 
of all the features of a plan that reduce the amount spent on prescription drugs 
in comparison with an individual who faces no financial constraints on the ability 
to purchase prescription drugs. This includes savings that result not just from 
price discounts, which would increase drug usage, but from features of the plan 
that will discourage beneficiaries from purchasing drugs at all, such as deductibles, 
high co-payments and formularies.</font></li>
