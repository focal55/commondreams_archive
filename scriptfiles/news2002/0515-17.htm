<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - May 15 - &quot;Today's introduction in Congress of the so-called Federal Marriage Amendment is really anti-marriage, and is a vicious attempt to make the U.S. Constitution explicitly anti-lesbian and gay rights,&quot; said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Kim Gandy.  &quot;A better name for this bill is the Marriage Discrimination Amendment, because that reveals its true purpose.&quot;  The proposed amendment, authored by the misleadingly named Alliance for Marriage, states that &quot;Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman&quot; and would even prohibit states from providing such rights in their own constitutions.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I never cease to be amazed that anyone would actively oppose the marriage of any two people who want to make a legal commitment to love, honor and support each other,&quot; Gandy said.  &quot;But proposing to amend the Constitution to specifically discriminate against the lesbian and gay community is mean-spirited.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Lesbians and gays face discrimination, harassment and even violence at school and in the workplace. Congress has already prevented the economic and legal benefits of marriage for same-sex couples. And Congress continues to refuse to include sexual orientation in hate crimes legislation by not passing the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act,&quot; said Gandy.  &quot;At a time when the country is still recovering from a hate-filled terrorist attack, slinging this hate-filled legislation through Congress is the last thing we need.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Activists across the political spectrum have vowed to stop this bill,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;Every member of Congress is going to hear from women and men from their districts who know that hate is not a family value. Congress would do well to uphold the true purpose of the U.S. Constitution by rejecting an amendment that would move us further way from the ideal of basic respect for human rights and equality for all.&quot;</font></p>
