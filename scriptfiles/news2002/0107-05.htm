- January 7 - After a five month ban, the

award-winning national 

radio program Democracy Now!, returned to Pacifica

Radio&#146;s airwaves on 

Monday. But the show&#146;s home station WBAI in New York

defied a directive 

by the new listener-backed Pacifica National Board.

The board ordered the show

back on the air in 

its original time-slot (9-10am EST). By not

broadcasting the program, WBAI continued its

policy of 

censorship and the firing and banning of producers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now! was banished from Pacifica airwaves in

the midst of an

attempted corporate takeover of the only independent

radio network in 

the

United States. Today&#146;s return came as a result of a

two-thirds majority 

vote of the new board, required by last month&#146;s legal settlement which 

moved the Pacifica crisis closer to resolution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a critical day in the history of Pacifica

Radio,&quot; said Leslie 

Cagan, the chair of the new Pacifica board. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I just want to say how much I love you, how much I

like your show,&quot; said activist-comedian Dick Gregory,

who was the swing vote on the board mandating that the

ban be lifted and that Democracy Now! be restored.

&quot;I'm glad you're back.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After discovering that Democracy Now! was not airing

live on WBAI, 

filmmaker Michael Moore, a guest on the program,

called the radio station 

from Democracy Now!&#146;s studio as the show broadcast

live to ask &quot;Where am 

I? I don&#146;t hear myself on WBAI.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moore was attempting to reach WBAI&#146;s General Manager

Robert Daughtry. A 

receptionist at the station then put Moore&#146;s call

through to the public 

affairs director, who said the station would not air

the program. 

Moore&#146;s on-air confrontation with the only Pacifica

station that refused to 

air Democracy Now! comes days before  the new Pacifica

National Board 

will meet face to face in New York this weekend. Los

Angeles station KPFK also censored the program,

refusing to broadcast it at 9 am, its usual time

slot-- which has the largest audience. The station

only aired it at 6am. WPFW in Washington began the

program ten minutes into the broadcast and censored

the end of the show in which host Amy Goodman

dedicated the program to the banned and fired at WBAI

and KPFK.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also appearing on the program were activist-comedian

Dick Gregory, a 

new member of the Pacifica National Board, Professor

Noam Chomsky, Leslie 

Cagan, the new Chair of the Pacifica board. New York

Daily News 

columnist and Democracy Now! co-host Juan Gonzalez

returned to the program 

after a year of leading a campaign to win back

Pacifica. Fired

WBAI programmer Bernard White also appeared on the

program.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today was a tremendous victory for pro-democracy

media activists 

around the country who have fought tirelessly to

return Pacifica to its 

original mission: to go to where the silence is and

say something,&quot; said 

Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman. &quot;It is not surprising

that our home 

station WBAI censored today&#146;s live broadcast. This is

a station that 

continues to fire and ban producers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now! is Pacifica&#146;s flagship national program

and its host Amy 

Goodman has won numerous journalism awards. Rather

than ending the show 

after Pacifica banned it, Democracy Now! expanded. In

addition to 

broadcasting on Pacifica station KPFA in Berkeley, the

program aired on 

community radio stations around the country and, in

the largest public 

media collaboration in the country, has begun

broadcasting a daily national 

TV show which airs on Free Speech TV&#151;channel 9415 of

Dish Network -- 

and public access cable TV stations nationwide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new Board majority is determined to return the 50+

year old 

listener-sponsored network to its peace and social

justice mission. One of the 

first moves of the new board was to vote at their

first board meeting, 

a conference call to bring back Democracy Now! Among

the issues yet to 

be resolved are the return of banned and fired

producers at WBAI and a 

resolution of a news stringers strike against the

Pacifica Network 

News.
