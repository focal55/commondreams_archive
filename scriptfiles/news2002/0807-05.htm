FRANCISCO - August 7 - In ruling on a lawsuit brought by environmental groups, 

Federal District Court Judge William Alsup has found that nearly every cabinet 

level agency in the U.S. Government has violated the Energy Policy Act of 1992 

by failing to buy or lease the legally required percentages of Alternative Fuel 

Vehicles (AFVs) for their federal fleets. The lawsuit was brought by Earthjustice 

on behalf of the Center for Biological Diversity, Bluewater Network, and Sierra 

Club.</font>

<p> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Energy Policy Act, signed into law after the Gulf War by George Bush I 

in 1992, was designed to wean 10% of American transportation fuel demand from 

petroleum by the year 2000 and 30% by the 2010. The Act requires all federal agencies 

with light duty fleet vehicles in major metropolitan areas to acquire at least 

75% Alternative Fuel Vehicles each year instead of traditional petroleum-fueled 

cars and trucks. The federal government currently has over 600,000 vehicles in 

its fleet, the largest in the nation. Judge Alsup declared that all defendant 

federal agencies violated the Act's AFV-acquisition requirements in at least some 

years</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Alsup also found that all the defendant federal agencies have further 

violated the Energy Policy Act by failing to disclose to the public through annual 

compliance reports whether they had acquired the legally required numbers of AFVs. 

Agencies covered by this ruling include: Departments of Commerce, Defense, Interior, 

Transportation, Agriculture, Justice, Labor, and State, as well as the Department 

of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, General 

Services Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 

Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is a major victory for anyone who believes this nation's transportation 

system is dangerously addicted to petroleum including, it seems, President Bush's 

father. Hopefully the federal government will finally get with the program,&quot; 

said Jay Tutchton, staff attorney with Earthjustice, the environmental law firm 

that represented the plaintiffs in the suit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Alsup ordered the government to prepare overdue reports of their non-compliance 

with the law by November 26, 2002, and to make these reports available to the 

public over the Internet by January 31, 2003. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In these compliance reports, which defendants illegally withheld, every federal 

agency must not only admit its prior failings to acquire the legally required 

number of AFVs, but also must submit a specific plan, including dates, by which 

it will come into compliance with the law. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These compliance plans and reports will finally set enforceable deadlines,&quot; 

said Tutchton. &quot;Maybe now Bush II can enforce his father's law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Energy Policy Act also requires the Department of Energy to consider a 

regulation to extend the AFV acquisition requirements to private and municipal 

fleets in major metropolitan areas, which it has failed to do. Judge Alsup ordered 

both sides to provide further briefing on how long the court should give the Department 

of Energy to take action on the overdue regulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;AFVs are available on the market. The federal government has no excuse 

for not following the law. Hopefully by exposing the failings of the government 

we can re-direct the current national energy plan away from a drill-and-despoil 

mantra and toward cleaner future,&quot; said Peter Galvin of the Center for Biological 

Diversity.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Environmentalists concerned about air pollution have long touted alternative 

fuel vehicles. &quot;AFVs are cleaner than traditional vehicles. Burning alternative 

fuels as opposed to gasoline will lessen the toxic chemicals currently spewing 

from our tailpipes, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas pollution--the main 

culprit behind global warming,&quot; said Elisa Lynch of Bluewater Network.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The U.S. buys more than a half-million barrels of oil a day from Iraq,&quot; 

said Daniel Becker, director of Sierra Club's Global Warming and Energy program. 

&quot;Instead we should be using alternative fuels and increasing the fuel economy 

of our cars, trucks and SUVs. It's crucial that the Administration stop breaking 

this law because it moves us closer to reducing our dependence on oil.&quot; </font></p>
