<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - July 24 - </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>WHAT:</b> Public Demonstration, 

Street Theatre and Press Conference <br>

<b>WHEN:</b> Tomorrow, THURSDAY, JULY 25TH from 12 to 1 pm<br>

<b>WHERE:</b> 1211 Avenue of the Americas (6th Avenue at 48th Street in Manhattan), 

at the offices of WestLB</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Following on the heels 

of activist Julia Butterfly Hill&#8217;s arrest and deportation last week from 

Ecuador, US environmental groups are bringing the international campaign against 

the OCP oil pipeline to the New York offices of WestLB, the German bank that is 

syndicating $900 million to the pipeline. Members of Greenpeace, Amazon Watch 

and Wetlands Preserve are staging a press conference and public demonstration 

on Thursday outside the offices of WestLB, the lead financier for Ecuador&#8217;s 

new heavy crude pipeline. WestLB&#8217;s loan to the OCP pipeline violates its 

own policies.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;There is a growing international campaign against the OCP pipeline. 

There have been dozens of protests in Germany, Ecuador, and elsewhere around the 

world and there will be more focused on WestLB, the pipeline&#8217;s primary financial 

backer. We call on WestLB to cancel the OCP loan,&#8221; said John Passacantando, 

Executive Director of Greenpeace USA. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May 1992, in the run up to the Rio Summit that year, the &quot;UNEP Statement 

by Banks on the Environment and Sustainable Development&quot; was launched in 

New York. Since then, private banks including WestLB have joined as signatories 

agreeing to take an active role as a leader in promoting environmental responsibility 

in the financial sector. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;WestLB cannot in good faith remain a signatory to UNEP Finance Initiative 

and continue financing this destructive project which is threatening intact rainforests 

and endangered species,&#8221; said Atossa Soltani, Executive Director of Amazon 

Watch. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Groups also criticized JP Morgan Chase, the project&#8217;s financial advisor, 

and Citigroup, which has extended a $200 million line of credit to Perez Companc, 

Argentinean member of the OCP consortium, to enable their participation in this 

project and their drilling operations in Yasuni National Park. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Environmentalists will present evidence to the press regarding OCP&#8217;s 

failure to meet international standards known as ISO 14000, a legal requirement 

for the project&#8217;s environmental license. Evidence was recently leaked by 

a former employee of Entrix, the environmental consulting firm for the OCP consortium 

who was fired shortly after blowing the whistle on the Consortium&#8217;s failure 

to comply with these standards.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background:<br>

The controversial 300-mile pipeline would transport heavy crude from the country's 

rainforest region to the Pacific Coast, placing fragile ecosystems &#8211; including 

11 protected areas - and dozens of communities along the 300-mile route in jeopardy. 

In order to fill the new pipeline, Ecuador plans to double its current oil production 

in the Amazon region, setting off an unprecedented boom in the Yasuni national 

park and other protected and indigenous lands. According to the Ecuadorian government, 

the majority of Amazon crude shipped via the OCP pipeline is destined for US markets.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">West LB is loaning $900 million to the OCP (the consortium of oil companies 

building the pipeline) in violation of its own lending policies. The loan, which 

does not meet minimum World Bank environmental guidelines, has sparked public 

outrage in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia (NWR), which holds a 43 

percent stake in WestLB. There have been numerous protests in Germany including 

some planned this week. Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum is a key member 

of the OCP consortium. The other members of the OCP Consortium include: Alberta 

Energy (Canada), AGIP (Italy), Repsol-YPF (Spain), Perez Companc (Argentina), 

and Techint (Argentina). </font></p>
