<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 25 - The Sierra Club today expressed disappointment with

Senators who turned their backs on an opportunity to save one million

barrels of oil a day. By a vote of 57 to 42, Senators rejected an amendment

offered by Sens. Tom Carper(D-DE) and Arlen Specter (R-PA), to require the

Department of Transportation to reduce oil consumption from our cars and

light trucks by one million barrels of oil per day by 2015.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Senate failed to give Americans what they've asked for -- a

responsible energy plan that reduces our dependence on oil,&quot; said Carl

Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.  &quot;The Carper-Specter amendment

was a reasonable, realistic and responsible goal that could have put us on

the right path to reducing our dependence on oil.  The Senate threw away a

chance to reduce global warming pollution while saving Americans money at

the gas pump.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Carper-Specter amendment would have:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saved more oil than the U.S. currently imports from Iraq and Kuwait

combined,</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Helped curb global warming by keeping some 45 million metric tons of

carbon equivalent emissions out of the atmosphere every year,</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Improved our air quality, and protected our public health, by keeping

millions of tons of cancer-causing toxic and smog-forming emissions out of

the air we breathe,</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Saved consumers billions at the pump, keeping dollars at home rather

than sending them overseas to pay for oil.  These dollars, invested in the

economy, would help improve wages and create jobs.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though this amendment was not as effective as specifically increasing fuel

economy standards, it could have been an important step in the right

direction to protect America's national energy security and our

environment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Americans want to cut our oil dependence and increase our use of clean,

renewable energy.  While the Senate energy bill began as a promising plan,

polluters plundered the bill.  Now the Senate bill utterly fails to meet

America's energy needs, and instead sends America backward.  The abysmal

Senate bill:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">saves virtually no oil;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">hardly increases renewable energy;</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">eliminates safeguards that protect consumers from Enron-like

manipulations; and</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">gives billions of dollars in subsidies to dirty coal and oil, and

dangerous nuclear power.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next stop for this bill is a conference with the House energy bill that

shares the shortcomings of the Senate bill and compounds them by opening

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.  The House bill is

missing even the modest energy efficiency and renewable provisions of  the

Senate bill,  and adds about $20 billion in tax breaks for dirty energy

industries.  Both the House and Senate bills fail the test of a sound

energy policy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This bill is a failure because it doesn't significantly reduce oil

dependence or pollution,&quot; said Pope. &quot;Congress must create a different plan

which protects our energy future, while protecting our land, air and water

at the same time.&quot;</font></p>
