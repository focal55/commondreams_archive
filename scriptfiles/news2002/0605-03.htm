<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 5 - In the wake of new Drug Enforcement Administration

raids on medical marijuana providers in California, the D.C.-based Marijuana

Policy Project (MPP) is joining in a national day of protest on June&nbsp;6.

Organized under the banner of &quot;Americans for Safe Access&quot; (ASA),

medical marijuana patients, their families, friends, and supporters are

planning protests and nonviolent civil disobedience in 55 cities nationwide.

<P>Bruce Mirken, director of communications

for MPP, will join in civil disobedience in the D.C. area, honoring a longtime

friend with AIDS whose health has been imperiled by the DEA's raids.</P>



<P>There will be two protests near Washington:

In the late morning, activists will risk arrest to post a &quot;Cease and

Desist&quot; order at a DEA facility. At 5:00&nbsp;p.m. there will be a

second demonstration at the DEA's headquarters at 700 Army Navy Drive in

Arlington, Virginia. Information about other events planned around the country

is available at <A HREF="http://www.safeaccessnow.org/">ASA's Web site</A>.</P>



<P>The June 6 date was chosen because the

U.S. District Court in northern California is expected to reaffirm on June&nbsp;7

that it is illegal under federal law to distribute medical marijuana, a

ruling that may be seen by the DEA as a green light for more raids.</P>



<P>&quot;This does not mean, however, that

the DEA should be using its resources to target medical marijuana distributors,

especially in these times of terrorism,&quot; said Robert Kampia, MPP's

executive director. &quot;Furthermore, the federal court decision will not

in any way negate the eight state laws that allow patients to use, possess,

and grow their own medical marijuana legally.&quot;</P>



<P>&quot;I decided last week to join in the

civil disobedience, after getting a call from my friend Mary Lucey in Los

Angeles,&quot; Mirken said. Lucey, who served as interim AIDS Coordinator

for the city of Los Angeles, found that marijuana was the only thing that

allowed her to tolerate the harsh side effects of the anti-HIV drugs she

must take to stay alive. &quot;Marijuana is an absolutely essential part

of her therapy, and the DEA's raids last October cut off her safe supply.

Now she lives in constant fear. Our government has chosen, as a matter of

policy, to torture the sick, and those of us who are healthy have a responsibility

to stand up for them.&quot;</P>



<P><I>NOTE TO JOURNALISTS:</I> MPP, the nation's leading organization advocating

for medical marijuana, has numerous resources available to help journalists

put the issue in context. MPP's &quot;<A HREF="http://mpp.org/statelaw/index.html" target="_new">State-By-State

Medical Marijuana Laws: How to Remove the Threat of Arrest</A>&quot; is

the definitive analysis of state medical marijuana laws. A summary of key

findings from the Institute of Medicine's landmark 1999 report on medical

marijuana is available <A HREF="http://mpp.org/science.html">here</A>. MPP's Web site

also has extensive information on <A HREF="http://mpp.org/canada.html" target="_new">Canada's medical

marijuana program</A>.</P>
