- June 25 - A newly released report, License to Rape, documents the rape of 625 
girls and women in Burma&#8217;s Shan state, including against girls as young 
as five and perpetrated almost entirely by military officers from 52 different 
battalions. The report, compiled and published by the Shan Human Rights Foundation 
and Shan Women&#8217;s Action Network from interviews with refugees in Thailand, 
opens a small window into the methods of Burma&#8217;s pariah military junta, 
and represents figures &#8220;far lower than reality.&#8221;</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Republican United States 
Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Chairwoman of the International Operations 
and Human Rights Subcommittee in the International Relations Committee, said in 
a statement yesterday (Monday), &#8220;girls and women of Burma are raped, tortured, 
beaten, and killed as part of a systematic campaign by the Burmese army to subjugate 
its people.&#8221; Ros-Lehtinen added that the newly released report &#8220;provides 
a microcosm of the ongoing efforts by the Burmese army to thwart resistance and 
opposition by sanctioning and condoning the use of rape as a weapon of war against 
its civilian population.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report documents how 
83% of the rapes have been carried out by military officers, usually in front 
of their own troops. Victims are severely beaten, tortured and mutilated; 25% 
were killed after the rapes, with many left dead in public areas to terrorize 
villagers. The rapes have taken place in the process of massive relocation programs, 
at military checkpoints, and in villagers&#8217; homes. 61% were gang rapes, and 
numerous women were raped inside military bases. In many cases, women were held 
captive and raped repeatedly for up to four months as &#8220;comfort women&#8221;. 
The report uses the legal precedents set during international criminal tribunals 
for Rwanda and Bosnia to illustrate a strong case that Burma&#8217;s regime continues 
to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity in Shan state, home to only 8 
of Burma&#8217;s 50 million people.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One interview describes 
a young Burmese woman who left her house for a short time only to come back and 
find her five year old sister &#8220;tied up and crying, with her sexual organs 
bloody&#8230;&#8221; from being raped. In another case, a young woman was raped 
and beaten unconscious, only to wake up and find her pregnant sister lying dead 
next to her. In yet another case, two young girls girl were ordered from a middle 
school meeting and were raped at gunpoint by a military commander for four days 
and four nights</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Betsy Apple, author of the 
1998 study of Burma&#8217;s military dictatorship School for Rape, says there 
is clear evidence that the regime is using rape as a weapon of war: &#8220;As 
rape has been used in Rwanda and Yugoslavia to terrorize villagers, Burma&#8217;s 
military regime is using rape as a weapon of war. This time, however, CNN is not 
investigating.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aung Din, a former political 
prisoner in Burma and director of policy at the Free Burma Coalition, citing the 
300,000 Shan that have been forcibly relocated, called the rapes &#8220;Just one 
part of an ongoing campaign of terror against Burma&#8217;s people by the ruling 
military junta.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report comes just after 
the birthday of 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, whose release 
from house arrest last month gained world attention and fueled speculation that 
the regime has relaxed its campaigns of terror against Burma&#8217;s people. However, 
the new report provides fresh evidence that abuses by the regime continue unabated 
in areas outside the capital city of Rangoon. </font></p>
