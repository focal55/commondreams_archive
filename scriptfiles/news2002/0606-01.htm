- June 6 - According to statistics released at the end of May by the U.S. Department of Commerce, apparel imports from the Southeast Asian country of Burma dropped 35% in January through March of this year. Concerned with human rights abuses including forced labor and forced child labor, dealing with a sudden cancellation of import licenses for foreigners, and facing legislation that would ban all imports from the country, 30 U.S. importers and/or retailers have announced they will not sell goods from Burma since June 2000, including retail giants Wal-Mart, Kenneth Cole, Hanes, and Gart Sports.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We&#146;re heartened that American companies are extricating themselves from Burma&#146;s brutal system of forced labor,&#148; said Judy Nutter, a national officer for the one million member United Methodist Women, one of 30 organizations calling for companies to stop production in the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Companies sourcing goods from Burma have come under increasing criticism from human rights groups as the pervasive use of forced labor by Burma&#146;s pariah military dictatorship has come to light.  The U.S. State Department Country Report on Human Rights released on March 4th, 2002 drew the connection between forced labor and the export of garments: &#147;Forced labor, including forced child labor, has contributed materially to the construction of industrial parks subsequently used largely to produce manufactured exports, including garments.&#148;  The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that &#147;millions&#148; of persons have been pressed into forced labor in Burma.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A group of 22 Senators, led by Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Jesse Helms (R-NC), has introduced legislation that would ban all imports from Burma in response to the International Labor Organization&#146;s call for its member countries to ensure they do not contribute to forced labor in Burma.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, many companies doing business in Burma have already expressed their concern over human rights abuses in the country.  Gart Sports, the United States&#146; second largest retailer of sports apparel and operator of 180 stores in 25 states, recently cancelled plans for $1 million in new orders from Burma, stating, &#147;We thought it was the right thing to do&#148;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adding uncertainty to Burma&#146;s already unstable investment and production market, the dictatorship recently stopped issuing import licenses to foreign companies in an apparent bid to give local companies an advantage.  The move especially hurt citizens of Burma&#146;s fellow Southeast Asian countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decline in imports from Burma marks a major reversal of recent trends. Since 1997, when the United States imposed a ban on new U.S. investment in the country over human rights, democracy, and drug concerns, apparel imports from the country skyrocketed 480% to over $400 million per year in the regime&#146;s apparent attempt to garner more foreign exchange.  However, apparel imports from Burma decreased from $116.886 in January-March 2001 to $75.967 million January-March 2002.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A notable exception to the move to stop selling goods from Burma is TheChildren&#146;s Place Retail Stores, Inc., according to   Dr. Zar Ni, a Burmesedissident in exile and founding director of the Free Burma Coalition. &#147;Until this company stops selling goods from Burma, The Children&#146;s Place is no place for children.&#148; </font></p>
