- April 30 -  Coalfield activists say a Bush administration proposal would set a precedent with negative implications for the environment nationwide. The proposal would exempt mountaintop removal coal mining operations from a decades-old stream &#147;buffer zone&#148; provision of the nation&#146;s surface mining laws.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The buffer zone provision of federal mining law bans coal strip mining within 100 feet of streams. The Associated Press yesterday reported that the Interior Department's Office of Surface Mining has proposed to exempt coal companies from this provision of the law.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last week, another Bush Administration proposal angered coalfield residents. That proposal would legalize otherwise illegal valley fills at mountaintop removal operations.  The proposal would allow polluters to dump industrial and mining waste into waterways across the nation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1999, a federal judge ruled that most large valley fills were created in violation of the buffer zone rule. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed that lawsuit for jurisdictional reasons, but the judge&#146;s ruling was not addressed. Coalfield residents have filed a new lawsuit that eliminates the jurisdictional question.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;In a way, these absurd proposals are a bittersweet victory for us,&#148; said Janet Fout, co-director of the Huntington, W Va.-based Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC). &#147;Obviously, the lawsuits have shown that we are right -- the way the coal industry is blowing up mountains and burying streams in southern West Virginia is illegal.  Now, we see a dangerous precedent set by Bush and his appointees, many of whom came from the industry they are supposedly regulating. They obviously have taken a cue from the West Virginia Coal Association: If you don&#146;t like the law, break it.  If someone challenges you in court, get the politicians you fund to change the law in your favor.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The buffer zone rule is a key legal protection that coalfield citizens fought for years and years to pass into law,&#148; said Nathan Fetty, issues coordinator with the West Virginia Rivers Coalition. &#147;Now President Bush would snuff out this protection, appeasing his friends in the coal industry and continuing an open-ended assault on our mountain streams. King Coal refuses to do business according to the rules, so the president wants to change the rules yet again. Could there be a more arrogant and crooked way for the coal industry to make a fast buck?&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pauline Canterberry, a resident of Sylvester, W Va. asked, &#147;Is Bush out to gut every law written to protect human health and the environment?  People have to understand it&#146;s not just poor Appalachians who will suffer under these dangerous proposals.  If you breathe air or drink water, you are affected.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;If you believe in the authority of Congress to enact laws, look out.  In their rush to pay back their Big Energy contributors, Bush and his buddies are stepping all over American democratic principles. They are simply out of control in rewarding their campaign funders.  They are putting citizens in the coalfields in danger,&#148; Canterberry said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In mountaintop removal, mostly practiced in southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, coal companies mine thin layers of low-sulfur coal by blasting off the tops of forested mountains. The area's temperate forests are some of the most biologically diverse forests on earth. The blasts that reduce the mountaintops to rubble have ruined homes and water wells and driven people away from their mountain towns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rubble from the mountains is pushed into nearby valleys, burying streams and creating valley fills. In West Virginia alone, over 1,000 miles of biologically crucial headwaters streams have already been buried under these massive valley fills.</font></p>
