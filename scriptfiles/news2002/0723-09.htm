- July 23 - We are extremely disappointed that the President signed a resolution 

today naming Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the site for the storage of some of the 

country's nuclear waste. It is tragic that the President is willing to put millions 

of Americans who live and commute along nuclear waste transport routes in harm's 

way.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controversial project has been opposed by broad coalition of national groups 

representing doctors, teachers, parents of school children as well as environmentalists. 

However, industry executives spent lavishly to woo politicians and to mount a 

campaign disguising the fact that the Yucca Mountain project would seriously jeopardize 

public safety for millions of Americans. Industry executives see the project as 

vital in their desire to build more nuclear reactors, which produce highly radioactive 

waste for which there is no safe disposal option.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yucca Mountain itself is in a zone intersected by 33 earthquake faults and 

is situated above an aquifer, which provides the only source of drinking water 

for a nearby community. The project includes the proposed hauling of approximately 

100 thousand shipments of highly radioactive nuclear waste from all across the 

country to Yucca Mountain. The Department of Energy admits that transport accidents 

will happen. When the dump is full, because the nuclear industry continues to 

generate lethal radioactive waste, we'll have nearly as much waste left at sites 

around the country as we had to begin with.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During his run for office, President Bush had made a campaign promise to designate 

Yucca Mountain only on the basis of &quot;sound science.&quot; We were shocked 

when the President ignored 293 serious technical concerns exposed by the General 

Accounting Office and designated the site anyway. By signing the Yucca Mountain 

resolution, President Bush has put millions of Americans in harm's way.</font></p>
