<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SACRAMENTO, 
CA - July 1 - Today, by a 41 to 30 vote, the California Legislature passed the 
first bill in U.S. history to regulate global warming pollution from cars and 
light-duty trucks. Assembly Bill 1493 would make California a national leader 
in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global warming. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AB 1493 is the successor bill to AB 1058, a global warming bill championed 
by author Fran Pavley during the last two years. The new legislation includes 
language that addresses public fears stirred up by an auto industry disinformation 
campaign. The bill now explicitly prohibits new taxes on vehicles, fuels or miles-traveled, 
speed limit reductions, or mandatory reductions in vehicle weights. In addition, 
it calls for an immediate policy hearing on the greenhouse gas emissions standard 
subsequent to the development of the regulations by the California Air Resources 
Board. Like AB 1058, AB 1493 instructs the California Air Resources Board to develop 
the maximum technologically feasible, cost-effective reductions of greenhouse 
gases by January 2005. Auto manufacturers are still given the maximum flexibility 
to decide how to achieve these standards, and consumers' pocketbooks are still 
protected, as the regulation must be economical to the owners and operators of 
passenger vehicles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passage of AB 1493 in the California Assembly comes on the heals of several 
new studies on global warming including one by the Environmental Protection Agency 
for the United Nations, as well as Bluewater Network's Scorched Earth: Global 
Climate Change Impacts on Public Lands and Waters. The latter chronicles how global 
warming is the leading threat to America's most treasured public lands, including 
Yosemite National Park and Tahoe National Forest. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This vote sends a clear message to Washington that California refuses 
to sacrifice our children's future on an altar to oil industry profits. There's 
nothing sacred about burning more fossil fuels,&quot; said Russell Long, Executive 
Director of Bluewater Network, the bill's original sponsor. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Long concluded, &quot;We're proud of California lawmakers who faced down the 
Chicken Littles in the auto and oil industries, and did the right thing for our 
environment and economy. Cleaner vehicle technologies have been available for 
years. Establishing greenhouse gas standards will finally get these technologies 
off the shelves and into our cars, SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks, giving motorists 
more and better choices.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In California, transportation is responsible for 59 percent of the greenhouse 
gas pollution, compared to 31 percent for the nation as a whole. If unchecked, 
global warming is expected to have devastating effects on California's environment 
and economy, including seriously reduced water availability, increased air pollution, 
more catastrophic wildfires, and dangerous beach erosion. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The bill now awaits Governor Davis's signature. If AB 1493 is signed into 
law, California will become a national leader in reducing global warming pollution. 
Other states will be able to adopt California's air quality regulations according 
to a provision in the Clean Air Act. </font></p>
