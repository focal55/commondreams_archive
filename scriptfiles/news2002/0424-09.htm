- April 24 - 

 &quot;&quot;Today anti-choice lawmakers in the House voted to censor information that would allow young people to make intelligent and informed decisions about their reproductive health,&quot; said NARAL President Kate Michelman. The vote came as members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee defeated every reasonable attempt to improve restrictive &quot;abstinence-only&quot; education. Instead, the bill that was passed provides another quarter of a billion dollars to unproven programs that censor discussion of contraception, thereby failing to help young people protect themselves against unintended pregnancies, HIV and STDs. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When it comes to responsible sex education, President Bush and anti-choice lawmakers continue to defy medical and public opinion. Over 125 national health organizations and the American public strongly support providing responsible sex education to American youth,&quot; stated NARAL President Kate Michelman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Over the past few years, ideologically driven groups, not scientific or public health organizations, have pushed for abstinence-only education,&quot; said Michelman. &quot;This is a potentially deadly mistake. Approximately one-quarter of all new STDs occur in teens, almost half of all new cases of HIV occur in people under 25, and three-fourths of all teenage pregnancies are unintended. The most effective way to reduce these numbers is by providing comprehensive, medically accurate information to young teens,&quot; stated Michelman. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Contrary to anti-choice rhetoric, responsible sex education does not promote or encourage young people to have sex.&quot; Michelman continued, &quot;It does just the opposite. Teens receiving comprehensive sex education wait longer to have sex, have it less frequently, and increase their use of contraceptives.&quot; </font></p>
