- June 12 - One thing the Right does well is repetition. Their talking points may have little relation to the truth, but once launched into the echo chamber of right-wing political groups, editorial boards, pundits, magazines, and Web sites, the neatly packaged distortions get repeated so frequently that they take on a life of their own.</FONT>
    <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></P>
    </font><P>
      <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Repeating a message is basic public relations strategy, and the sheer number of right-wing groups and media outlets guarantees that members of the media and the public—especially activists linked to right-wing groups—will be bombarded so frequently that even ludicrous assertions can take on an aura of respectability. Of course, that’s the whole point. It’s one way the Right turns fiction into a semblance of "conventional wisdom."</FONT>
    </P>
    <P>
      <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The right-wing’s language around judicial nominations is an interesting case study of this phenomenon. If the underlying issue—the future of our courts and our Constitution—were not so important, the right-wing’s rabid rhetoric might be merely comical. However, given that their coordinated assaults are intended to intimidate senators into rubber-stamping President Bush’s judicial nominees, we must take their strategies seriously.</FONT>

    </font></P>
    <P>
      <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On February 8, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page vented its spleen over what it considered unfair treatment by Senate Democrats of Charles Pickering, President Bush’s right-wing choice for a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The <I>Journal</I> accused People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas of manipulating the judicial confirmation process to Pickering’s disadvantage. According to the <I>Journal</I> editorial board, Neas is the "liberals’ puppet master": "[H]e’s Edgar Bergen and Senate liberals are his Charlie McCarthys. He gives them their attack themes, and they then repeat them to skewer some hapless nominee..." The "puppet" metaphor was quickly picked up by a variety of right-wing interest groups and news outlets<I>.</I> Here are but a few examples:</FONT>

        <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In three separate instances since March, televangelist Pat Robertson has proffered the puppet metaphor. For example, on the March 7 installment of the <I>700 Club</I>, Robertson said, "Those people on the [Senate Judiciary] committee are like little puppets; Ralph Neas pulls the string and they jump at his command."</FONT>

        <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a bold stroke of journalistic independence, <I>Denver Post</I> columnist Al Knight bucked the "puppet" trend, instead referring to Senate Democrats as "parrots": "The Democrats on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee have lately resembled parrots as they mindlessly repeat lines written by the People For the American Way."</FONT>

    <P>
      <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>’s "puppet" metaphor was absurd on its face, another image currently popular with the Right is entirely more disturbing. In early March, when it became clear that Judge Pickering’s nomination to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was opposed by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Concerned Women for America issued a press release asserting that the judge was being "lynched." Within days, a number of GOP political figures followed suit. Senator Orrin Hatch, the Committee’s ranking Republican, accused "extreme left" interest groups of "lynching" the nominee. Meanwhile, employing an ungainly mix of metaphors, Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott said: "They’ve already taken a scalp. They lynched Charles Pickering. They took a swipe at the president and me. Okay, you got your pelt ... You’ve taken your pound of flesh." And Bush political advisor Karl Rove, speaking before the Family Research Council on fostering cooperation between the Administration and the Christian Right, referred to the Pickering affair as a "judicial lynching."</FONT>

      <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such an inflammatory misuse of the term prompted author Linda R. Monk to write in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>:</FONT>

        <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The word has special meaning to native Mississippians like Pickering and me. From 1882 to 1944, there were about 4,700 lynchings in the United States; Mississippi led the nation with 573. Of Mississippi’s victims, 93% were African American ... Pickering should be the first to admit that he was in no way ‘lynched.’ It’s important to remember what a real lynching is.</FONT>

        <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., argued that the use of the term "lynching" was "truly inappropriate" in the Pickering case, Concerned Women for America president Sandy Rios responded with a self-righteous broadside:</FONT>

      <P>
        <FONT size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We’re sorry for Sen. Schumer’s discomfort, but perhaps if someone had the courage back in the old South to stand up and call a lynching by its real name, the atrocities committed there might have been stopped. Instead people stood by as innocent black people were persecuted. As witnesses to the senseless attacks on Charles Pickering, we will not be silent bystanders. We are calling out, in whatever terms we must, for the senators of the judiciary committee to stop this <B>lynching.</B> <I>[The emphasis is Rios.’]</I></FONT>
