<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 17 - The Republican proposal for welfare ignores the everyday obstacles that block families who are earnestly trying to make the transition from welfare to work. The Republican proposal worsens the prospects for poor families and the stringent work requirements coupled with the inadequate childcare and related supports funding raises a real threat to all low-wage workers. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal assistance programs should seek to end poverty by developing job skills and helping working parents with childcare, housing and transportation. Ending poverty for families requires good paying and secure jobs with benefits, not a faster proliferation of low skill and low pay jobs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Republican proposal takes a myopic approach to helping the working poor by focusing only on numbers of employed as a measure of success. The proposal forces families-often led by single mothers-to work 40 hours per week while trying to care for their children and improve themselves, and ignores the reality that the same perks that enable lawmakers to work full time and care for their families are not accessible to families desperately trying to stay off the streets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To meet the high enrollment guidelines laid out in this proposal, states are likely to expand the questionable Workfare programs, which have so far failed to end dependence on government assistance. In New York City, the one place where workfare was implemented on a large scale, just 62 of the nearly 18,000 workfare participants in 2001 transitioned to regular city jobs. At the same time, 16,000 low-skilled public employees lost their jobs as the number of workfare participants reached a high of 36,000. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expanding workfare will displace those working today without making substantial gains in moving TANF recipients to jobs. Expanded workfare will result in a zero sum gain for the state and a personal loss for thousands of workers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The House proposal also weakens federal laws by giving the states the option to waive federal guidelines on labor laws and eligibility requirements for public assistance. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's vote on welfare reform disregards the crucial point that the transition from welfare to work is a staggeringly difficult uphill battle and to successfully make the transition, would-be workers need comprehensive support. It is imperative that Congress reverse the trend of the House vote and commit to providing TANF recipients with the training and supports necessary to move to good paying jobs with benefits and a secure future for their families.</font></p>
