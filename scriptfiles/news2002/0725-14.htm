- July 25 - News Advisory: </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S. District Court Judge Alan S. Gold will hear motions for summary judgment 

on Friday, July 26th, 2002 in the case of NAACP v. Harris et al. The suit has 

been brought by People For the American Way Foundation and other civil rights 

organizations on behalf of the NAACP and African American voters denied the right 

to vote in Florida in the 2000 general election. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Gold will hear a motion Friday from PFAWF and its co-counsel asking the 

court to restore voters who were purged through the use of ex-felon lists from 

other states; these states automatically restore voting rights to citizens once 

they have completed their sentences, and therefore these voters retained their 

rights when moving to Florida. Plaintiff's motion also asks the court to find 

that the state violated federal law by failing to conduct the statewide purge 

program of voter rolls in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner across the 67 

counties. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The suit states that Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris along with 

Florida Elections Division Director Clay Roberts and several other defendants 

unlawfully abridged or denied black citizens the right to vote during the November 

2000 election. The suit seeks the restoration of the rights of voters wrongly 

purged, and reforms in the administering of elections to ensure compliance with 

federal voting rights laws. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This hearing is an important step towards the August 26 trial. The suit currently 

involves Harris, Roberts and other state officials as well as several Florida 

counties. People For the American Way Foundation and its co-counsel have settled 

their suits against two counties who have agreed to undertake several key election 

reforms. We have also settled our suit against Choicepoint/DBT, the private contractor 

hired by the state to prepare lists for use in purging voter rolls statewide. 

Choicepoint/DBT has agreed to reprocess the voter lists using narrower, more accurate 

criteria than the state used prior to the November 2000 elections. </font></p>
