- July 25 - We are encouraged that House Republicans have taken an important step 

and put a compromise election reform proposal on the table. The proposal represents 

some limited progress in key areas.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, while taking one step forward, this proposal takes at least 

two steps back. The proposal pays lip service to our major concerns, but the fine 

print reveals a different story.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">House Republicans have removed a significant obstacle to enforcing the minimum 

standards in the legislation and have made clear that student identification will 

be accepted at the polls.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, they have weakened those very standards by removing critical language 

addressing the types of mechanical errors that disenfranchised so many citizens 

in the 2000 elections and stripping important provisions guaranteeing disabled 

voters equal access to the secret ballot.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposal also contains two major rollbacks of the National Voter Registration 

Act, often called Motor Voter. The document maintains the worst provision in the 

House bill-allowing states to purge occasional voters and denying those removed 

from the rolls unnecessarily the opportunity to correct the mistake at the polls. 

This provision alone will likely disenfranchise millions of legitimate voters.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, this proposal goes a step further in rolling back voter protections. 

The legislation would actually require voters to present a drivers license number 

or the last four digits of a social security number just to register to vote.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of election reform has always been to make voting easier for qualified 

Americans. This is reflected in the title of the bill-the Help America Vote Act. 

Unfortunately, this new proposal seems more focused on keeping people out of polling 

places than on laying down the red carpet for those who were needlessly disenfranchised 

in 2000.</font></p>
