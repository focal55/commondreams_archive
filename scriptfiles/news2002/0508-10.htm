- May 8 - Chefs, restaurant

owners, and scientists came together today to announce their

joint effort to save from extinction a delicacy whose overnight

popularity has proven to be its downfall. Sixty of Washington

D.C.'s top restaurants, caterers, and retailers took the first

step today towards saving Chilean Sea Bass by pledging to stop

serving or selling the fish until its population begins to

recover.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">D.C. area restaurants that have signed on to the campaign



include (complete list available):

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Galileo

<br>

Cesco

<br>

Jefferson

<br>

Equinox

<br>

Jaleo

<br>

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We're keeping Chilean Sea Bass out of our kitchens to ensure

that future generations will be able to enjoy the fish," said

Roberto Donna, chef and owner of Galileo, whose signature

restaurant provided a backdrop for the event.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The restaurant industry accounts for 70 percent of all

Chilean Sea Bass sales in the United States.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chilean Sea Bass burst onto most menus only 10 years ago, and

last year Bon Appetit named Sea Bass "Dish of the Year", while

showing a photograph of and describing Chilean Sea Bass. But

now, according to Destined for Extinction: The Fate of Chilean

Sea Bass, the report released today, Chilean Sea Bass suffers

from acute over-fishing by "pirate" poachers in the remote

waters near Antarctica and is on the verge of extinction.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We are pleased that so many Greater Washington area chefs

are joining this national campaign to help save Chilean Sea Bass

from extinction," said National Environmental Trust (NET)

president Philip E. Clapp. "We've gained the support of more

than 500 chefs across the nation who want to join in the fight.

Since we've seen such an overwhelming response from DC area

chefs, we are hopeful that more local restaurants and those in

other cities will quickly follow their lead."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite regulations set by the Commission for the

Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), the

international governmental body that regulates Chilean Sea Bass,

estimates indicate that nearly 80 percent of Chilean Sea Bass

sold on the world market is illegally obtained.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several weeks ago the U.S. Departments of Commerce and State

issued a joint press release and fact sheet that confirmed

illegal Chilean Sea Bass enters the United States and that

"illegal poaching of Chilean sea bass threatens the Commission's

(CCAMLR) conservation attempts."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The non-stop pace of illegal fishing virtually guarantees

that the entire species will collapse in less than five years

unless we take immediate action," said Beth Clark, a former

Antarctic research scientist and a U.S. delegate to CCAMLR. "Last

year alone -- with regulations in place -- nearly 40,000 tons of

Chilean Sea Bass were illegally fished in the waters around

Antarctica."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The practical reality is that current regulations are not

enough to protect Chilean Sea Bass from extinction," said Andrea

Kavanagh, campaign manager at NET. "Until we have a reliable

system to track legal versus illegal catches of Chilean Sea

Bass, we have to make it unprofitable for the pirates to

continue poaching and ask consumers to "Take a Pass on Chilean

Sea Bass."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Not serving Chilean Sea Bass is the right thing to do," said

Todd L. Gray, chef and owner of Equinox Restaurant. "Our guests

strongly support us because they agree that it's not worth

sacrificing an entire species for our short-term appetites."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to asking for support from chefs around the

country, today "Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass" kicked off

their consumer campaign with a one-minute flash animation video.

The short animated clip highlights the need to protect Chilean

Sea Bass and asks consumers to join chefs in taking the pledge

to not eat, buy or serve Chilean Sea Bass until stronger

regulations are in place and enforced. The flash animation and

consumer pledge can be accessed at:

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "Take A Pass on Sea Bass" Campaign was launched in San



Francisco in February, Chicago in March, and Philadelphia in



April. Similar efforts are scheduled to take place in New York



and Los Angeles. More information about the campaign can be
