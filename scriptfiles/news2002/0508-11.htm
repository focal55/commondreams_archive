- May 8 - The following is Common Cause&#146;s reaction to the lawsuits filed today to oppose the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Those who gave more than $500 million in unlimited contributions to politicians have already filed suit to undo the law Congress passed and the President signed,&#148; said Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger. &#147;They give millions to make billions, and they want to keep the corrupt system in place. Now the RNC and state parties have filed additional suits on behalf of those who receive these contributions and dole them out to candidates. This is a last ditch effort to keep the money coming.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;It is unfortunate that some who favor public financing, like the National Voting Rights Institute, are joining the likes of Kenneth Starr and Mitch McConnell, who believe giving money to politicians is the same as free speech. We expected the Soft Money Empire to strike back at the reform law. Now some supporters of further reform are joining the evil empire and staging an &#145;Attack of the Clones,&#146; repeating the arguments of big money donors in a joint effort to undermine McCain-Feingold. This is one sequel too many. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;McCain-Feingold is a first step in reform and we share the goal of additional advances, but by filing suit, the National Voting Rights Institute is undermining its own goal of a broad-based, unified coalition fighting for a stronger campaign finance system. We will work with Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold, (D-WI), and Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT), and Marty Meehan (D-MA), and the rest of the Americans for Reform coalition to protect the law Congress passed from the those who profit from the current system, as well as those whose goals are so completely at odds with their tactics.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Background: Today is the deadline for suits against the McCain-Feingold, Shays-Meehan legislation. </font></p>
