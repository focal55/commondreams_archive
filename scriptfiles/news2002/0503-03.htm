- May 3 - On May 6, 2002, investors in Phillips Conoco, one of the largest oil companies operating on Alaska's North Slope, will vote on a shareholder resolution that calls on the company to report on potential environmental damage from drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge at their annual meeting.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We believe that Phillips Conoco's support for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge represents a significant risk to shareholder value,&quot; said U.S. PIRG communications director Elizabeth Hitchcock. &quot;Drilling in the Refuge carries a high degree of operating and financial risk and will affect Phillips Conoco's efforts to build a reputation as a good corporate citizen.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hitchcock will represent Green Century Capital Management at the Phillips Conoco annual meeting.  Green Century Capital Management administers two environmentally responsible mutual funds, the Green Century Balanced Fund and the Green Century Equity Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Green Century Capital Management and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate filed the resolution on behalf of concerned shareholders and environmentalists, including U.S. PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign.  This is the first Arctic Refuge shareholder resolution ever filed with Phillips Conoco.  Last month, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), the government agency that regulates disputes and transactions between shareholders and companies, announced that it had rejected Phillips Petroleum's attempt to disqualify the Arctic shareholder resolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides being one of the biggest oil companies in Alaska, Phillips Conoco is a member of Arctic Power, a special interest group funded by the oil industry and the state of Alaska to lobby Congress in support of allowing oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month, the U.S. Senate voted 54 to 46 against allowing oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge.  The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last wild places left in the United States. Caribou, muskoxen, wolves, polar, brown and black bears, and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds rely on the wilderness habitat that the Refuge provides.  The Gwich'in people, Alaska natives who live near the Refuge, depend also on the caribou.  For 20,000 years, their culture and way of life have been intimately bound up with the Porcupine River caribou herd.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Working with Green Century Capital Management and other socially responsible investors, the PIRG Arctic Wilderness campaign has filed shareholder resolutions with all four oil companies that have expressed interest in drilling in the Arctic Refuge.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>U.S. PIRG is the national lobbying office for the State Public Interest Research Groups.  State PIRGs are non-profit, non-partisan public interest advocacy groups.</i></font></p>
