<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MIDLAND, MI - May 9 -   At the Dow Chemical annual shareholders meeting today, representatives of survivors and support organizations demanded Dow CEO Michael D. Parker clean up the contamination, and compensate the victims for the ongoing medical and economic hardships caused by the gas disaster in Union Carbide's pesticide factory in Bhopal, India, in 1984. Dow purchased Union Carbide in 2001 but has refused to accept Carbide's pending liabilities for environmental and human rights violations in Bhopal. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is my hope that the gravity of our situation can be understood by our willingness to travel around the world to state our case for 5 minutes,&quot; said Dr. H. H. Trivedi, a Bhopal survivor who addressed Mr. Parker during the Q&amp;A phase of the meeting. Parker's refusal to meet privately with the survivors the day before the shareholders meeting prompted Dr. Trivedi to comment, &quot;How can your company tout its dedication to corporate responsibility while turning a cold shoulder to us?&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bhopal survivors allied themselves with Midland residents, citing the recent discovery of widespread dioxin pollution at the local Dow plant that poses a serious threat to the community. As part of their US tour, the survivors donated to the Midland Center for the Arts a replica of the Bhopal monument originally dedicated to the victims of the disaster. At an unveiling ceremony, Midland and Bhopal were named sister cities, united in their chemical legacies and by Dow's lack of commitment to clean up their toxic waste and prevent a Bhopal-type disaster from happening elsewhere. Also, part of the Bhopal alliance is a growing number of U.S.-based South Asians. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poison gas leak from the Bhopal factory in 1984 killed an estimated 8,000 immediately. More than 120,000 people suffer severe medical problems even today and are in need of urgent medical attention. Union Carbide only paid between $370-$533 per person to the Indian Government in February 1989. Hundreds of thousands have missed out on adequate or proper compensation. The abandoned factory remains, with toxic waste and pesticide residue strewn about the property. The groundwater in the area is still contaminated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Dow's ownership of Union Carbide has not changed the need for the Bhopal site to be cleaned up or for the survivors to be rehabilitated,&quot; noted Dr. Mary Elizabeth Harmon, of Greenpeace. &quot;U.S. law doesn't absolve responsibility for contamination due to transition of ownership. A lesser standard outside the US is unconscionable,&quot; she continued. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An international coalition, including survivors, has formed to convince Dow Chemical to take responsibility for the toxic legacy in Bhopal. The coalition, which includes Greenpeace, the Bhopal Gas Affected Women Stationery Workers Association, Bhopal Gas Affected Pensioners Association, Bhopal Group for Information and Action, National Campaign For Justice in Bhopal, The Other Media and CorpWatch India, Ecology Center of Michigan, Environmental Health Fund, Environmental Health Watch, Pesticide Action Network, Essential Action, Bhopal Action Resource Center and the Center for Health, Environment and Justice have demanded that Dow:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">clean up the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal, India; </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">provide long term medical assistance and services to the Bhopal victims; </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ensure economic rehabilitation for the victims; and </font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">face criminal liability charges as owners of Union Carbide in the ongoing case pending in the Bhopal District Court. </font></li>

</ul>
