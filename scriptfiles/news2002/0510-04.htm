- May 10 - In honor of Mother's Day, mothers, Greenpeace,

Organic Consumers Association and Pesticide Action Network joined

together at Safeway's headquarters to protest the grocery chains use of

genetically engineered (GE) foods. The group is demanding that Safeway

remove untested GE ingredients from its store brand products and in

particular its Select brand infant formula. The activists conveyed their

message with a banner reading, &quot;Safeway's Genetically Engineered Food

Tested on Kids, Not Mother Approved.&quot; The group also requested a meeting

with Safeway's CEO, Steven Burd, about these risky foods and promises to

continue to pressure Safeway until it commits to going GE-free.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laboratory testing commissioned by Greenpeace has revealed that Safeway

Select Infant Formula is made with genetically engineered soy. The

findings follow a recent report by the preeminent British scientific

organization, The British Royal Society, which called for infant

formulas that contain genetically engineered ingredients to be

&quot;investigated more rigorously&quot; because infants are more vulnerable to

potential health risks of these experimental foods. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Safeway is making children the guinea pigs in the genetic experiment on

our food supply,&quot; said Jeanne Merrill, Greenpeace genetic engineering

campaigner. &quot;Safeway must act to protect children and their families

by removing genetically engineered ingredients from its infant formulas

and all other store brand products.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The British Royal Society, the UK's National Academy of Sciences, in the

report, Genetically Modified Plants for Food Use and Human Health - An

update, called for more health safety tracking of genetically engineered

food products, particularly those foods consumed by infants. The

scientists note that infants are especially vulnerable to the health

risks caused by genetically engineered foods, since formula is often

their sole or primary food for an extended period. The report

specifically mentions allergies as a potential consequence that should

be monitored among infants and children who are exposed to GE foods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Safeway's GE foods are not even labeled, so there is no way for parents

or doctors to monitor these critical health issues,&quot; stated concerned

mother Judith Barish. &quot;People have the right to know what they are

feeding their children. If Safeway truly cares about their customers, it

will stop secretly polluting their food.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Safeway uses genetically engineered food in its store brand products

without any warning to its customers. By keeping its use of genetically

engineered ingredients a secret, American shoppers are left in the dark

about this important health and environmental issue. Since Safeway won't

let consumers know about genetically engineered food, Greenpeace has

complied a list of over 2,000 food products that do and do not contain

genetically engineered products. The True Food Shopping List can be

found at www.truefoodnow.org.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace is advising shoppers to:

<br>

* Let Safeway know they don't want genetic experiments in their food;

<br>

* Become informed shoppers by reading labels and identifying foods that

are commonly engineered, like corn, soy, and canola or cotton seed oil;

and <br>
