- August 6 - Nearly 30% of the nation's largest industrial, municipal, and federal 

facilities were in serious violation of the Clean Water Act at least once during 

a recent 15-month period, according to a report released today by U.S. PIRG. Permit 

to Pollute: How the Government's Lax Enforcement of the Clean Water Act is Poisoning 

Our Waters describes many shortcomings in the monitoring of water pollution and 

efforts to deter polluters, at the same time that the Bush Administration has 

proposed slashing EPA's budget for enforcement.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It is outrageous that 

the Bush Administration is proposing to slash enforcement budgets when nearly 

30% of polluting facilities are breaking the law,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Environmental 

Advocate Richard Caplan. &quot;With widespread violations of the law, this is 

no time for the Bush administration to take cops off the beat.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using the Freedom of Information 

Act, U.S. PIRG obtained and analyzed the behavior of major facilities nationwide 

by reviewing violations of the Clean Water Act between January 2000 and March 

2001, as recorded in U.S. EPA's Permit Compliance System database.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Major findings of the report 

include:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ten states with the 

greatest number of major facilities in Significant Non-Compliance (SNC) were Texas, 

Ohio, New York, Indiana, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, 

and Pennsylvania.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ten states with the 

highest percentage of major facilities in SNC were Utah, Texas, Tennessee, Wyoming, 

the District of Columbia, Indiana, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Kansas, and Ohio.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">134 major facilities were 

in SNC during the entire 15 month period.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To bring about consistent 

compliance with permits and move toward the zero-discharge goals of the Clean 

Water Act, U.S. PIRG recommends the following:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Set tougher penalties. 

Penalties should be set high enough to remove any economic incentive for polluters 

to break the law and to deter lawbreaking in the first place.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Allow citizens full access 

to the courts. Obstacles to citizen suits should be removed, including current 

rules that bar citizens from suing federal facilities.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Expand the public's right 

to know. The public should have greater access to information about enforcement, 

including the requirement of submissions of comprehensive data by facilities that 

discharge into waterways and easy accessibility of that data through online Internet 

searches.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of the Clean Water 

Act was to make U.S. waterways fishable and swimmable by 1983 and to achieve zero 

discharge of pollutants to waterways by 1985. However, according to the most recent 

EPA data, 40% of U.S. surface waters do not meet the fishable and swimmable standard. 

Representative Pallone (NJ) has introduced legislation (H.R. 5079) that would 

accomplish the recommendations listed above, and Sen. Corzine (NJ) is expected 

to introduce similar legislation shortly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As we near the 30th anniversary of the Clean Water Act, we urge Congress 

and the President to listen to the public's demands for clean water. The Administration's 

proposed cuts to EPA's enforcement budget take us in the wrong direction at the 

wrong time,&quot; concluded U.S. PIRG's Caplan.</font></p>
