FRANCISCO - July 30 - U.S. peace and human rights groups

have formed a coalition called United for Peace, whose

mission is to promote events about peace, justice and

healing to commemorate the first anniversary of the

Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and

Pentagon. &#8220;The response to this idea has been

overwhelming,&#8221; said Medea Benjamin, founding director

of San Francisco&#8217;s Global Exchange and a founder of

United for Peace. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to show the world that

in hundreds of U.S. cities, people are claiming the

anniversary of 9/11 as a time to say YES, a peaceful,

just world IS possible, and we are building it.&#8221;</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peace events are already being planned in big cities

like New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC and small 

towns such as Seadrift, Texas and Chester, West Virginia. They range from peace 

festivals, picnics and concerts on the weekend of Sept. 7 &amp; 8 to more solemn 

events like candlelight vigils and interfaith services on Sept. 11. There are 

also events planned in France and India. What ties the events together is their 

theme: envisioning a world without war and violence.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A group of Sept. 11 victims&#8217; family members is

participating in the United for Peace project. &#8220;Please

help us honor the death of our loved ones by creating

Sept. 11, 2002 events that move us toward a future of

peaceful tomorrows,&#8221; said Kelly Campbell of September

Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows. &#8220;We don&#8217;t

want the first year commemoration of the 9/11 tragedy

to be used to call for more war and violence.&#8221; Other

groups involved in United for Peace include the

National Coalition for Peace and Justice, Fellowship

of Reconciliation, American Friends Service Committee,

Peace Action, Veterans for Peace, War Resistors League

and Global Exchange. Arun Gandhi, the grandson of

Mahatama Gandhi, has also endorsed the project.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United for Peace website will be launched on Tuesday, July 30 at <a href="http://www.unitedforpeace.org" target="_new">www.unitedforpeace.org</a>. 

The site will allow people to post information about local 9/11 events and share 

ideas and resources about issues of concern to peace activists.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Let&#8217;s make Sept. 11 a time to put forth a vision of a safer, more 

just world&#8212;a world free of war and violence, a world that rejects ethnic 

and religious divisions and celebrates diversity, a world that cherishes the environment, 

a world were the needs of humans and other living things take priority over profits,&#8221; 

Benjamin said. </font></p>
