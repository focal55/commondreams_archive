- July 2 - As Americans fight bumper to bumper traffic, long lines at airports 
and other holiday hurdles, they may find that their 4th of July plans are at risk 
from much more serious obstacles, according to a new report released today by 
U.S. PIRG. America's Environment at Risk details how big polluters have convinced 
the Bush administration to support policies that will degrade the country's favorite 
vacation spots, and threaten public health and the environment.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Americans swimming and fishing at beaches and lakes around the country, 
hiking in our national parks, and picnicking and playing sports at their local 
parks this weekend are at risk of losing these simple pleasures and more,&quot; 
said U.S. PIRG Legislative Director Anna Aurilio. &quot;The polluters' assaults 
on the environment and public health don't just threaten our vacations; they promise 
to darken our skies, choke our lungs, and pollute our waters,&quot; she continued.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S. PIRG's report shows 
that behind closed doors and away from public scrutiny, the Bush administration 
has allowed polluters like the oil companies, electric utilities, the nuclear, 
coal and auto industries to water down or completely gut the cornerstone laws 
designed to protect America's environment and public health. The report documents 
16 different ways in which the Bush Administration has allowed the polluters to 
degrade the environment and compromise public health in states across the country. 
Specifically, the report finds:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush administration 
recently announced a significant weakening of the Clean Air Act, long-lobbied 
for by the electric utilities, that could allow dozens of power plants, refineries 
and other facilities in the Washington, DC metro area to actually increase their 
emissions of smog- and soot-forming pollution and toxic mercury. Dirty power plants 
within fifty miles of Washington DC cause an estimated 260 premature deaths and 
thousands of asthma attacks each year.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush administration, 
at the behest of the timber industry, has failed to implement a rule that would 
permanently protect the 394,000 acres of forested areas in Virginia that are untouched 
by roads, including areas in the George Washington National Forest.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nuclear power industry 
and the Bush administration are pushing through a plan to transport highly radioactive 
nuclear waste through 44 states, including Washington DC on its way to the Yucca 
Mountain nuclear waste depository. More than 289 rail shipments of deadly nuclear 
waste will travel alongside commuters and through our neighborhoods in the DC 
area.</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Industrial polluters have 
convinced the Bush administration to weaken the Clean Water Act's program designed 
to clean up the DC area's impaired waterways. More than 98 miles of Washington 
DC-area rivers, including the Potomac River, are chronically polluted with sediment, 
pathogens, and toxic chemicals.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. PIRG report draws from and expands on reports from a coalition of 
environmental groups including Defenders of Wildlife, Natural Resources Defense 
Council, National Parks Conservation Association, and the Wilderness Society.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These are just a few examples of how America's environment and public 
health are threatened by this unprecedented assault by the polluters,&quot; said 
Aurilio. &quot;This Fourth of July, we are asking the American public to send 
a loud and clear message: Tell the Bush Administration to stop helping big corporations 
trample our environmental laws. At a time when the Bush Administration is beginning 
to talk about corporate irresponsibility, they should remember that their first 
responsibility is to the American public, and stop letting polluters off the hook.&quot;</font></p>
