<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK   - May 16 - As Bill Clinton leads the U.S. delegation to East Timor's independence celebration, the East Timor Action Network (ETAN) urged that the history of 

U.S. support for Indonesia's military occupation of East Timor not be 

forgotten. On May 20, East Timor will become the first new nation of the 

millennium.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When former President Clinton, joined by his last ambassador to the UN, 

Richard Holbrooke, congratulates the East Timorese people on their hard-won 

victory, we must remember that as the most important supporter of 

Indonesia's illegal occupation, the U.S., owes the new country an enormous 

moral debt. We urge the Clinton delegation to acknowledge it,&quot; said John M. 

Miller, spokesperson for ETAN.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger had not given the go 

ahead for Indonesia's invasion in 1975, tremendous suffering could have 

been avoided,&quot; added Miller.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As detailed in declassified documents recently released by the National 

Security Archive, on December 6, 1975, then-U.S. President Ford and 

Secretary of State Kissinger gave Indonesian dictator Suharto a green light 

to invade East Timor, which his military did the next day. The U.S. 

supplied 90 percent of the weapons used during the invasion. For the next 

twenty-three years, from Ford to Clinton, successive U.S. administrations 

consistently backed Indonesia's occupation, providing Jakarta diplomatic 

cover and billions of dollars in weaponry, military training, and economic 

assistance. More than 200,000 people -- one-third of the population -- were 

killed as a result.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When video footage and photographs of a November 1991 massacre in Dili, the 

capital, were smuggled to the outside world by reporters who survived the 

bloodbath, international support for East Timor's independence grew 

dramatically. Following the massacre, the newly-formed East Timor Action 

Network successfully worked with members of Congress to block some weapons 

sales and military training to Jakarta.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the aftermath of East Timor's overwhelming vote for independence on 

August 30, 1999, the Indonesian military (TNI) and its militia proxies laid 

waste to the territory, killing at least 2,000 and forcibly displacing more 

than two-thirds of the population. Through intelligence intercepts and 

press reports, the Clinton administration was aware of Jakarta's plans to 

engage in such terror but failed to threaten a cut off of American economic 

and military aid as a preventative measure. It never issued a presidential 

statement warning of repercussions if Indonesia did not comply with 

obligations to ensure security for the U.N. ballot.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A week into the TNI's scorched-earth campaign, Clinton belatedly cut 

military assistance and other aid to Indonesia. The Indonesian military 

quickly agreed to withdraw and allow in international peacekeepers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Grassroots and congressional pressure did force the executive branch to 

make significant concessions on its Indonesia policy,&quot; said Miller. &quot;The 

U.S. supported the 1999 referendum and since September 1999 Washington has 

provided significant assistance to East Timor's reconstruction, but such 

aid does not begin to compensate the East Timorese people for the suffering 

wrought by 24 years of U.S. support for Indonesian military occupation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The U.S. government must declassify and release all relevant information 

needed to help the people of the U.S., Indonesia and East Timor understand 

what happened during the invasion and occupation,&quot; said Miller. &quot;We urge 

Congress to investigate the U.S. role, in order to avoid repeating policies 

like those which caused such suffering in East Timor.&quot;</font></p>
