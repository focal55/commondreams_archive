- May 6 - Representatives of survivors from the worst chemical 

disaster in history--the gas leak from the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, 

India in 1984 that killed thousands--have begun a tour in the United States 

to bring attention to Dow Chemical Corporation's pending liabilities of the 

gas disaster 17 years ago as well as the ongoing poisoning of the 

communities in Bhopal from the now abandoned plant.  Dow merged with Union 

Carbide in February 2001.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Justice in Bhopal tour will hold a public event in DC on Monday, May 6 

at 6:30 pm at the Martin Luther King Public Library, Room A 10 (9th and G 

Streets, NW, Washington DC).  Besides stopping in Washington DC, Chicago, 

San Francisco, San Jose and New York, the tour will also stop at Dow's AGM 

to be held at Dow's headquarters in Midland, Michigan on May 9.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In December 1984, lethal gases leaked from Union Carbide's pesticide 

factory in Bhopal, India, killing upwards of 8,000 people within three 

days, and over 20,000 people have died since.  Even today, more than 30 

people continue to die every month as a result of the gas exposure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What has exacerbated the problem even more is the presence of thousands of 

tons of toxic waste, left behind recklessly by Union Carbide in and around 

the now abandoned plant.  Studies have shown that the toxins have 

contaminated the ground water and the soil, and high levels of toxins are 

showing up in mother's milk in the resident who live in the area.  US 

Courts have ruled that Carbide is potentially responsible for the 

contamination and resulting health damages in Bhopal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carbide officials, including the then CEO Warren Anderson, who are charged 

with manslaughter and other serious offences, have refused to appear in 

Indian courts to face criminal trial relating to the gas disaster. 

Following Dow's acquisition of Carbide, Indian authorities have initiated 

legal action to name Dow as party in the criminal prosecution in Indian courts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dow Chemical maintains that there are no more pending liabilities in 

Bhopal.  In sharp contrast to its stand in India, Dow has accepted its 

liabilities from Carbide's asbestos related litigation in the US. In 

January 2002, Dow reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed in Texas against 

Union Carbide, which had mined asbestos and operated a unit that made 

products containing asbestos. This sent stock prices down by as much as 14 

percent.  In a twisted move, Dow Chemical is now investing substantially in 

India, one of the products being Dursban, a pesticide that is on its way 

out in the US because of EPA action due to safety concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The whole Union Carbide fiasco, and now Dow Chemical, exemplifies the 

double standards employed by powerful corporations,&quot; said Dr. Trivedi, a 

Bhopal survivor and a physician.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Neil Tangri of Essential Action, one of the sponsors for the 

DC event, &quot;the tour is designed to mobilize support for justice in Bhopal 

by making connections to local struggles here in the US and making sure 

there are no more Bhopals.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The tour and other activities is sponsored by Action against Corporate 

Crime and Toxic Terror (AcCcTt), an international coalition that includes 

Bhopal-based organizations Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh, 

Gas Peedit Nirashit Morcha and Bhopal Group for Information and Action and 

their allies Bhopal Action Resource Center, CorpWatch, Greenpeace, National 

Campaign for Justice in Bhopal and The Other Media.</font></p>
