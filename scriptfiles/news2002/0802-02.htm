- August 2 - Granting the American people a victory over the secrecy of the Department 

of Justice, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler today ordered the DOJ to 

release the names of the detainees caught up in an anti-terrorism dragnet following 

the events of last September. The Freedom of Information Act suit was filed by 

23 civil rights and civil liberties organizations, including PFAWF, the Center 

for National Security Studies, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic 

Privacy Information Center, in December 2001. The Department of Justice had responded 

to an earlier FOIA request with fragmentary, inadequate information, prompting 

the suit. PFAWF is co-plaintiff and co-counsel on the suit. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We're extremely pleased with the decision,&quot; said Mincberg. &quot;It 

requires the disclosure of information the Justice Department has held for far 

too long.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The American people have a right to know what the government is doing 

in their name,&quot; said People For the American Way Foundation Legal Director 

Elliot Mincberg. &quot;There is no doubt that the investigations following September 

11th were critical to national security. However, by sweeping an unknown number 

of people into open-ended detentions without releasing so much as their names, 

the government minimizes the role of oversight in protecting rights in America.&quot; 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Kessler's order requires the Department of Justice to release the identities 

of the detainees with two exceptions: If a court order exists prohibiting the 

release of the name, or if the detainee signs a statement indicating a wish to 

withhold his or her name. The order also requires the Department of Justice to 

release the names of the attorneys representing the detainees. The order upholds 

the authority of the Department of Justice to withhold the dates and places of 

arrest and detention. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our victory today demonstrates that the government cannot casually detain 

hundreds of people -- often on routine immigration violations or as material witnesses 

-- while keeping the American people in the dark about the detentions,&quot; said 

Mincberg. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The court order obliges the Justice Department to produce the names within 

fifteen days. The order also terms the Justice Department's attempt to search 

for documents concerning their disclosure policy as &quot;inadequate.&quot; The 

judge ordered the DOJ to conduct a new search for documents within 30 days in 

response to plaintiffs' FOIA request. </font></p>
