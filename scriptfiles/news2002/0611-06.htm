<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 11 - The Interfaith Alliance today was disappointed as the Senate failed to pass a cloture vote to make way for final approval of legislation designed to protect individuals targeted on the basis of gender, disability and sexual orientation.  In its first ever stand-alone vote, the senate voted against cloture for S. 625, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;We are both disappointed and saddened to see senators looking for ways to avoid passage of hate crimes legislation.  We cannot take a stand against hate crimes morally, only to watch our representatives in the highest levels of government fail to translate that opposition legally,&#148; said the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, Executive Director of The Interfaith Alliance.  &#147;We truly believe in the responsibility of the faith and political communities to work to promote diversity and equality and to fight against hate.  We cannot condemn hate and then refuse to act to stop hate and the violence that hate fosters in our society.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 106th Congress, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act was added as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act in the Senate. The Senate passed the bill with a wide bipartisan margin (57-42).  Similarly, the House of Representatives voted (232-192) for a measure instructing House and Senate conferees to include hate crimes language in the final DOD Authorization Bill in September 2000.  Despite broad support, however, the hate crimes legislation was stripped from the final bill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a press conference in May 2002, Gaddy, Rabbi David Saperstein, and several other religious leaders stood with Senators Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) to show their support for hate crimes protection.  As a demonstration of the interfaith community&#146;s steadfast cooperation, Gaddy presented a letter signed by over 500 members of clergy, from throughout the 50 states and drawn from diverse faith traditions, which urged swift passage of the senate legislation without any weakening amendments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;While a few religious voices, wrongly claiming to represent the view of all religious people, continue attempts to defeat bills to protect against hate crimes, those of us who value religious pluralism and practice interfaith cooperation will not waver in sending a strong, unified message condemning prejudice and supporting hate crimes legislation,&#148; pledged Gaddy.  To review the letter submitted to the Senate by over 500 individual members of clergy, see:</font></p>
