- April 30 -  A delegation of 13 U.S.

church leaders returned from the Middle East and, in a far-ranging

statement, called for bold steps to be taken by Israel and the

Palestinian Authority in order to end violence in the region and to

achieve peace with justice.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Entitled "By My Spirit," a reference to a biblical passage from

Zechariah that the delegation quoted in the document, the statement

expressed sympathy for all "Israelis and Palestinians who have lost

family members and friends to the senseless violence over the past

months."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation of church leaders was assembled by the National

Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. and its General

Secretary, Rev. Dr. Robert W. Edgar. The leaders traveled in the

region from April 16 to 27 at the invitation of the Middle East

Council of Churches. Before arriving in Palestine and Israel, the

delegation had stopped in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan to

speak with church and political leaders. Among others, the

delegation met with Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in Lebanon,

President Bashara al Assad in Syria, and King Abdullah II in

Jordan. Most meetings, and indeed, the statement issued by the

group, focused on the conflict between Israel and Palestinians.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the violence currently taking place in the region, the

delegation said in part, "We condemn equally and unequivocally both

the suicide bombings and Palestinian violence against Israeli

society and the violence of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian

territories. All are counterproductive to achieving peace with

justice. ...Both societies are caught in a cycle of violence and

revenge."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group showed particular concern for the continuing standoff

at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Some members of the

delegation had traveled to Jenin with a convoy of food and medical

aid; the group urged that the UN investigation of events be allowed

to proceed unimpeded. The delegation also demonstrated a

particular concern for the plight and future of Arab Christians in

the Middle East, noting that "(t)he Arab Christian population has

declined precipitously in recent decades."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, it was on the attainment of a just and lasting peace to

the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that the church delegates

expressed the most opinion: "Our delegation leaves the Middle East

convinced that an enduring peace can be achieved if the Israeli

occupation of Palestinian territories ends and if the establishment

of a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure State of Israel

follows soon." The group was equally strong in assessing the need

for Israel to have its peace and security guaranteed: "It (Israel)

is entitled to full recognition of its legitimacy within the

international community, including by the Arab states.

...Palestinians cannot expect to achieve the dignity, rights, and

respect they have sought for so long without ceasing acts of

violence against the civilian population of Israel."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation identified eight specific components for a just

resolution to the conflict. Included in these were "the

establishment of an international peacekeeping force, agreed upon

by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, to oversee the Israeli

withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza and maintain order until a

peace agreement can be fully implemented."
