- July 18 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force today joined with local Massachusetts 
activists to celebrate their joint success in defeating a right wing effort to 
pass an anti-gay constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage in the 
state. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The defeat of this anti-gay, anti-family amendment shows how national 
organizations can effectively partner with local activists to stand up for full 
equality for all gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender people,&quot; said Lorri 
L. Jean, the Task Force's executive director. &quot;No one, whether an agent of 
the government or of the radical religious right, should be in the business of 
punishing millions of same-sex partners for how they choose to organize their 
own families. A government 'for the people, by the people, and of the people' 
ought to serve everyone, and that means respecting and valuing our families equally.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yesterday, a Constitutional Convention was held where a joint session of the 
Massachusetts House and Senate voted 137-53 to adjourn immediately without taking 
a vote on the controversial issue. The Constitutional Convention was called after 
right wing groups collected the 130,000 signatures needed to initiate the process 
of passing a constitutional amendment. To appear on the ballot in November 2004, 
the ballot question needed to be approved by 50 of the 200 elected representatives 
and senators in the Massachusetts legislature before the two-year legislative 
session ends July 31, and again during the 2003-2004 session. If passed, the amendment 
would have made same-sex marriages unconstitutional in Massachusetts and accord 
marriage benefits only to unions between one man and one woman. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As an active member of MassEquality.org, a coalition of local, statewide and 
some national organizations formed to defeat the amendment, The Task Force was 
significantly involved from the outset of the campaign to defeat the question. 
In addition to providing ongoing support and technical assistance, the Task Force: 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Trained 30 state activists in critical campaign strategy and management. 
Many of these 30 later took on leadership roles in the campaign. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> -- By mobilizing its membership base in Massachusetts, generated thousands 
of letters to Massachusetts state legislators, urging them to vote against bringing 
the question to the voters.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> -- Provided MassEquality.org with a cash contribution of $18,000, making it 
one of the largest single donations to the campaign. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;From Day one The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has supported our 
effort to defeat this homophobic and misguided amendment,&quot; said Joshua Friedes, 
a board member of MassEquality.org and political director of EqualMarriage.org, 
one of the coalition's member organizations. &quot;They gave us the skills to 
set up and run an effective campaign, they gave us funding to help the campaign 
get off the ground, and they provided us with ongoing support and advice throughout 
the campaign.&quot; </font></p>
