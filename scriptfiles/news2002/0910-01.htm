- September 10 - <P><LI>SUSAN WRIGHT, <A HREF="mailto:spwright@umich.edu">spwright@umich.edu</A><BR>

Wright is co-author of <i>Preventing a Biological Arms Race</i> and of the forthcoming <i>Biological Warfare and Disarmament: New Problems/New Perspectives</i>. She said today: "If Saddam Hussein has had any inclination to wage war against

other Middle Eastern states, deterrence seems to have worked -- as it worked

between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. On the

other hand, war against Iraq would most likely generate a situation in which he

would be tempted to use weapons of mass destruction..."</p>

United Nations."</p>

Aruri is professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts 

at Dartmouth. He is author of the book <i>The Obstruction Of Peace: The U.S., 

Israel and The Palestinians</i>. He said today: "The hawks in the Pentagon are 

trying to find a way to war.... Their real agenda is to reshape the strategic 

landscape of the Middle East by redrawing not only the map of World War II, but 

that of World War I too, not unlike what the previous imperial powers (Britain 

and France) did when they balkanized the Arab world and fragmented it into more 

than 20 weak principalities and sheikhdoms, and at the same time allocated Palestine 

as a state for European Jewish settlers." [Today's <i>Boston Globe</i> has a news 

<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0910-01.htm">article</a> entitled 

"Iraq War Hawks Have Plans to Reshape Entire Mideast."]</p></p>
