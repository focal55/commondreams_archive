- June 17 - While the administration signals it is moving toward an all-out attack 
on Iraq, it has fined a Seattle resident, Bert Sacks, $10,000 for his admission 
that he took medicines to Iraq. Sacks decided to respond today [Monday] at a 10 
a.m. news conference at the National Press Club.</font>

A widely read historian who has authored numerous books including &quot;A People's 
History of the United States&quot; and &quot;Terrorism and War,&quot; Zinn said 
today: &quot;The punishment of a citizen for engaging in a humanitarian act -- 
bringing medicine to people in desperate need -- should not be accepted in a society 
claiming to believe in justice. To disobey a law, when that law violates a fundamental 
human right, is part of the American democratic tradition. We now honor those 
who, before the civil war, disobeyed the Fugitive Slave Act and helped black people 
escape from slavery. We honor those black people in the South who disobeyed the 
law in order to protest against racial segregation. The right to food and medicine 
is something guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Eleanor 
Roosevelt helped frame in 1948, and to which our nation is a signatory. Any law 
or regulation which eliminates that right does not deserve to be obeyed, and those 
today who bring food and medicine to people in need should be honored, not punished.&quot;</font></p>

Sacks is the first American to be fined by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control 
for his admission that he brought medicines to Iraq. Monday marks the last day 
the government gave Sacks to comply. Having recently returned from another trip 
to Iraq, Sacks explained: &quot;I have traveled to Basra, Iraq, where we delivered 
some of our medicine. The antibiotics we brought saved lives, especially the lives 
of young children who are most vulnerable to illness from unsafe water.... How 
can I ask the government which deliberately bombed civilian infrastructure during 
the Gulf War -- knowing it would create conditions of unsafe water and doing so 
as a tool of coercion -- how can I ask this government for permission to bring 
medicines to those still in need? .... A person alleged to have committed the 
same violation with respect to other countries, Cuba for example, is entitled 
to a hearing. With respect to Iraq, it appears that I am not. If I'd received 
a $100 traffic ticket, I'd be entitled to a hearing before a judge, but with this 
fine of $10,000, I am not.&quot;</font></p>

Co-founder of Voices in the Wilderness, a group that Sacks has traveled to Iraq 
with, Kelly said today: &quot;We will continue resisting economic warfare by sending 
delegations to Iraq and, if need be, taking up residence in Iraq in advance of 
and during any new massive military assault against Iraqi civilians.&quot;</font></p>

Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and author of the recent article &quot;Spinning 
'Smart Sanctions,'&quot; Bennis said today: &quot;The new 'smart sanctions' proposal 
... recently passed by the UN Security Council was largely crafted for spin purposes. 
While providing a new rhetorical device to claim that sanctions are not hurting 
Iraq's population, the bottom line is it won't do much to help the existing disastrous 
situation.&quot;</font></p>
