- May 3 - The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC)

Emergency and Material Assistance Program has shipped 85 pounds

of essential medicines for immediate relief for Palestinians in

the West Bank. The supplies, valued at approximately $31,000,

will be administered by AFSC field staff based in Amman, Jordan.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

This medicine was donated by Interchurch Medical Assistance (IMA)

in New Windsor, Maryland and will be consigned to the Union of

Palestinian Medical Relief Committees (UPMRC) in Ramallah in the

West Bank. Follow-up shipments are expected.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

In addition two 40-foot containers full of quilts will be sent

to the region for distribution to Palestinians affected by the

recent violence. In addition, these supplies may be earmarked

assist refugees displaced into Jordan by any potential US conflict

in Iraq.

AFSC is a faith-based organization working for peace and justice

in the world with headquarters in Philadelphia and regional offices

in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Des Moines, New York, San Francisco,

Seattle, Pasadena, California; and Cambridge, Massachusetts. The

AFSC Emergency and Material Assistance Program (EMAP), now in

its 81st year of operation, provides material assistance to those

in need in this country and abroad. Materials include clothing,

medical supplies, seeds, Friend-Ship Kits, and other requested

items. The program receives volunteer support to collect, sort,

and pack donations.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Operating from a belief in the dignity and worth of all people,

AFSC has been active in the Middle East since the 1940s, when

it was asked to receive and provide assistance to Palestinian

refugees in Gaza. In the 1950s, AFSC continued to work with internally-displaced

Palestinians in Israel and operated a youth center in Acre to

foster dialogue between Jewish and Palestinian youth in Israel.

AFSC supports similar programs in Israel, as well as working with

Palestinian youth in the West Bank and Gaza. AFSC will continue

to work closely with existing Palestinian and Israeli partner

organizations to assure that assistance will reach those most

in need.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Recently, responding to the escalating crisis in the Middle East,

AFSC launched a <I>Palestine-Israel Crisis Fund</I> to provide

humanitarian aid to Palestinians affected by the recent military

incursions into the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to support longer-term

reconstruction and peace building efforts in the region. $90,000

was initially earmarked to be used for immediate medical aid,

food, bedding and housing reconstruction.

</font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Donations to the Palestine-Israel Crisis Fund should be directed

to AFSC, marked &quot;Palestine-Israel Crisis Fund&quot; and mailed

to AFSC/Development, 1501 Cherry Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102.
