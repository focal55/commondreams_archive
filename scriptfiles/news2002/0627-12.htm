- June 27 - In a 5-4 decision today, the United States Supreme Court ruled the 
Ohio law creating a private-school voucher program in Cleveland is constitutional. 
The Interfaith Alliance was disappointed by the decision, and will reach out to 
its members to urge that school officials refrain from any further implementation 
of voucher programs. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“It is a sad day for people 
who value religious liberty and long for quality education for every child in 
the nation. Through a decision that weakens the nation’s historic commitment to 
religious freedom, the Supreme Court has encouraged the implementation of a voucher 
program that deflects money and reform efforts from the urban and minority communities 
that need it most, in favor of helping only a select few,” said the Rev. Dr. C. 
Welton Gaddy, Executive Director of The Interfaith Alliance. “No voucher program 
can address the needs of all of the children with inadequate educational conditions; 
our priority should be an improvement of our public schools.” </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the Court’s ruling in <i>Zelman v. Simmons-Harris</i>, the Court reversed a decision rendered by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had ruled that the Cleveland program violated the First Amendment to the Constitution.  The Interfaith Alliance is urging all people of faith and goodwill to ignore the Court’s decision and to instead focus on improving the well-being of all of our nation's schools and children.

</font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While affirming the value of private and sectarian schools, The Interfaith Alliance does not support any use of public financial resources for private institutions in grades kindergarten through twelve.   The Interfaith Alliance strongly advocates for the increased funding of public education in order to afford less advantaged schools with the money they need to hire and keep qualified educators, to purchase up-to-date equipment so that even the poorest children can be exposed to technology, and to create before-and-after school programs for children's academic benefit as well as their safety. 

</font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“Our public school system was created to offer a level playing field to all children, regardless of race, religion, or socioeconomic background,” added Gaddy.  “At a time when the White House and Congress promise to ‘leave no child behind,’ it is astonishing to see a decision that compromises the strength of our democracy, further erodes religious liberty and creates the possibility of leaving many children behind.”

</font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“Only with the strongest possible support for a system of quality public education 
that can improve the well-being of all of our nation's children can we rest assured 
that we are serving our calling as people of faith.” </font>
<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The Interfaith Alliance (TIA) is a non-partisan clergy-led grassroots organization 
dedicated to promoting the positive and healing role of religion in the life of 
the nation and challenging those who manipulate religion to promote a narrow, 
divisive agenda.</i></font></p>
