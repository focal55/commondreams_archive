<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 26 - The 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#8217;s (NRC) proposed changes to safety standards 
for transporting radioactive material would endanger public health and safety, 
groups opposing nuclear waste shipments to Nevada&#8217;s Yucca Mountain repository 
said today. The NRC held a public meeting on proposed changes to 10 CFR 71 at 
its Rockville, Md., headquarters this week. The changes are an attempt to &quot;harmonize&quot; 
U.S. regulations with weaker international standards. The Department of Transportation 
(DOT) also is proposing a parallel harmonization rulemaking.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is nuclear shipment 
safety as written by nuclear industry lobbyists &#8211; not government safety 
officials,&quot; said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the proposed rollback 
threatens protections for many types of radioactive shipments, it could have a 
spillover effect on standards for transporting high-level nuclear waste and irradiated 
fuel from commercial nuclear power plants &#8211; just as the nuclear industry 
is pushing a shipment plant of unprecedented magnitude to the Yucca Mountain repository 
in Nevada. In particular, proposed changes would weaken reporting requirements 
of events involving defective or shoddy high-level nuclear waste transport containers, 
and allow the nuclear industry to make design changes to licensed containers without 
prior NRC approval.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The NRC admits that 
there is no quantitative data which would conclusively show that harmonization 
improves public safety,&quot; said Bob Halstead, transportation advisor to the 
Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects. &quot;We are particularly concerned about 
NRC&#8217;s proposal to weaken the containment standards for plutonium waste shipments 
to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) facility in New Mexico.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">International standards 
also feature more lenient submersion test requirements for high-level nuclear 
waste shipping canisters and specify allowable levels of contamination on shipments 
&#8211; although the NRC is not currently proposing to adopt these changes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This proposed rulemaking 
fails to address any of our longstanding concerns about the inadequacies of regulatory 
standards governing irradiated fuel shipments,&quot; said Lisa Gue, policy analyst 
with Public Citizen. &quot;It does not even consider the specific implications 
of this administration&#8217;s plan to ship an unprecedented 77,000 tons of high-level 
nuclear waste on the roads, rails and waterways of 44 states and the District 
of Columbia.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">.The International Atomic 
Energy Association (IAEA), established in 1957 to promote nuclear technology internationally, 
has encouraged its 130 member countries &#8211; including the United States &#8211; 
to adopt its international standards for nuclear waste transportation, disposal 
and release into commerce.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This trend of invoking 
international standards as a justification for undermining more stringent domestic 
requirements does not bode well for NRC and DOT regulation of proposed nuclear 
waste repository shipments,&quot; Gue said.</font></p>
