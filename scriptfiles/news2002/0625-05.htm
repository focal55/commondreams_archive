<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OAKLAND, 
CA - June 25 - Consumer watchdog group Public Citizen filed a complaint today 
against a member of the San Bernardino Regional Water Resources Authority for 
failing to disclose her relationship with a politically powerful water firm that 
is at the forefront of efforts to profit from California&#8217;s water market. 
The board member is Susan Lien, also a San Bernardino city council member representing 
the city&#8217;s Ward 2.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In her financial disclosure form filed with the San Bernardino Regional Water 
Resources Authority, Lien did not disclose her income from Cadiz, Inc., an agricultural 
and water development firm in the Mojave area with rights to significant underground 
water deposits.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen filed the complaint with the California Fair Political Practices 
Commission (FPPC). The penalty for an FPPC violation is a $5,000 fine as well 
as civil liability for perjury.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The San Bernardino Regional Water Resources Authority is located in an area 
where Cadiz has significant operations. Cadiz is pursuing a controversial $500 
million contract to deliver water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California (MWD) for 50 years. The San Bernardino water authority sets water policy 
that could affect the MWD, thereby making it possible that Lien would influence 
the MWD to favorably negotiate with Lien&#8217;s employer, Cadiz.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lien is the Inland Empire regional manager for Cadiz and is responsible for 
corporate operations in the Inland Empire. She also serves as the company&#8217;s 
representative to water, civic, environmental, agricultural and governmental entities, 
providing public outreach and education on the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year 
Supply Program. That means she is employed to be a liaison to a board on which 
she serves.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are concerned that Susan Lien may vote on matters that impact the 
company she works for &#8211; a blatant conflict of interest,&quot; said Jane 
Kelly, director of Public Citizen&#8217;s California office. &quot;We are even 
more concerned that she didn&#8217;t disclose this conflict as required by law.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">State law requires public officeholders to fully reveal the extent of their 
financial interests to avoid conflicts of interest. Lien is obliged to disclose 
her salary from Cadiz in the FPPC&#8217;s Form 700 Statement of Economic Interest. 
However, on the Form 700 statements she filed with the water authority in 2000-2001 
and 2001-2002, she made no mention of her relationship with Cadiz.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lien was elected to the city council in 1998 and was named to the water board 
in 1999. She reported her Cadiz income in the 1999-2000 form she filed with the 
city of San Bernardino in her capacity as a council member. However, in the 2000-2001 
and 2001-2002 forms she submitted to the city, she did not report her Cadiz employment. 
In fact, she affirmatively indicated that she had no reportable interests, event 
though Cadiz is registered to do business in the city of San Bernardino.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Susan Lien&#8217;s omission in disturbing, especially considering that 
she reported working for Cadiz in years past,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;Cadiz is 
registered to do business in San Bernardino and its operations stand to be impacted 
by influencing San Bernardino water authority votes. That&#8217;s a clear conflict.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having a water board member on the payroll is one more example of how Cadiz 
is trying to influence California politics, Kelly said. Cadiz is a significant 
contributor to California Gov. Gray Davis and other elected state and local officials, 
including state senators, the lieutenant governor and to a Los Angeles mayoral 
candidate.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another Cadiz employee, Tim Shaheen, president and chief executive officer 
of Sun World International (a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadiz), serves on the 
Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board (LARWQCB), which also has the 
potential to render decisions favorable to the MWD, thereby enabling him to influence 
negotiations between Cadiz and the MWD. Shaheen has disclosed his employment in 
forms filed with the LARWQCB.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lien sits on a number of other panels that are influential in recommending 
water policy for Southern California, including the Southern California Water 
Committee Water Marketing/Transfers/Wheeling Task Force and the Association of 
Ground Water Agencies. In many of those bodies, she is described as an employee 
of Cadiz.</font></p>
