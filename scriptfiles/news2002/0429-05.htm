- April 29 - In response to breaking

news reports on possible changes in the federal student loan program,

the College Loan Corporation (CLC), a leading student loan provider,

called today on the White House and Congress to protect affordable

education for American students by safeguarding fixed interest

rates on federal student loans.

<p>"The consolidation of fixed rate student loans has made higher

education a reality for millions of students in this country,"

stated Mark Brenner, General Counsel for CLC. "The system works

for students and their families by making education more accessible

to more students. We need to protect the consolidated loan program

that offers low fixed interest rates. Without this protection,

high interest rates could price thousands of students out of their

dream of obtaining a higher education."

<p>Brenner cited figures from the Congressional Research Service

stating that the federal loan program helped over 680,000 students

consolidate $16.8 billion of loans in fiscal year 2001. He noted

that abolishing fixed interest rates on federal student loans could

cost the typical borrower over $2,800 more to pay for their

education. The poorest students who depend on federal Pell Grants

to finance higher education could pay over $3,100 more.

<p>"Both the Administration and the 107th Congress have worked hard

to make quality education affordable. We urge all members of

Congress and the Bush Administration to seriously consider the

impact that this change would have on the ability of all students

to obtain a higher education," Brenner stated.

<p><i>The College Loan Corporation is a leading national student loan

company offering Federal Family Education Program Loans (Stafford,

Plus and Consolidation loans) to students in all 50 states and the

District of Columbia. In the past two years alone, CLC has helped

tens of thousands of students borrow to finance their education at

more than 1,500 colleges and universities.
