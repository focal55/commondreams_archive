<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON  

- May 15 - Responding to the today's 

release of the Kerry-Frist &quot;US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB, and 

Malaria Act of 2002,&quot; the Global AIDS Alliance called the 

bipartisan effort a &quot;step in the right direction.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill authorizes increases in US government spending specific 

to global AIDS of about $1.7 billion in 2003 and to $1.9 billion in 

2004. Were Congress to approve such spending through the 

appropriations process, it would represent a significant increase 

over President Bush's spending proposals for FY 2003. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This bill is a step forward, and it shows that, because of 

mounting grassroots pressure, Congress is beginning to take AIDS 

seriously,&quot; stated Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global 

AIDS Alliance, a broad consortium of civic groups, activists, 

humanitarian agencies and religious groups. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, the bill falls short of providing the US fair 

share ($2.5 billion per year) of the $10 billion per year needed 

from all sources, just to fight AIDS, according to UN estimates. 

The World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and 

Health has estimated $15 billion per year is needed to fight global 

AIDS. &quot;The fight against AIDS has been rigorously costed out, and 

on these objective measures this bill still falls short,&quot; stated 

Zeitz. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the bill authorizes low levels of funding for the 

innovative, newly-established Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and 

Malaria, providing less than what experts have said is needed. The 

bill authorizes a FY2004 funding level for the Fund that is much 

lower than what has been requested by civil society groups and UN 

Secretary General Kofi Annan. The Secretary General has asked 

wealthy countries to double their contributions to the Global Fund 

each year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Kerry-Frist Bill authorizes significantly less resources 

for global AIDS at too slow of a pace than is appropriate for a 

global leader like the United States,&quot; stated Dr.Zeitz. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In practice, the funding levels authorized by this Bill will not 

be available for programs for another 18 months. During that time, 

another 3-4 million Africa will needlessly perish from AIDS. &quot;It is 

imperative that Congress approve $700 million in emergency AIDS 

funds for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, as an 

immediate, stop-gap measure,&quot; stated Dr. Zeitz. </font></p>
