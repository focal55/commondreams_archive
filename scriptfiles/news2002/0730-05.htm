- July 30 - The Sierra Club denounced a bill introduced to enact

President Bush's ineffective plan to deal with air pollution. The Sierra

Club is urging Americans to call their members of Congress and ask them to

oppose the bill, which will weaken the Clean Air Act and lead to more air

pollution that causes asthma, acid rain and global warming.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This bill hurts families, allows more air pollution and weakens the Clean

Air Act -- it benefits only irresponsible, polluting corporations. It

won't help communities protect their families and the planet from air

pollution,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.

&quot;Americans want to hold polluting companies accountable for dirty air and

to strengthen protections against the pollution that causes asthma, acid

rain, and global warming. Americans breathe cleaner air today than they

did 30 years ago because the Clean Air Act cracked down on polluters. We

need to strengthen this safeguard, not dismantle it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The existing Clean Air Act, including protections that make older

factories install modern technology when they increase their pollution,

will result in cleaner air than the Administration's plan as embodied in

this bill. The bill introduced today in the House and Senate allows more

smog-forming nitrogen oxide and potentially three times as much toxic

mercury than current law. Current Clean Air Act provisions achieve greater

air pollution reductions , while also protecting local communities.

Today's bill won't do nearly enough to cut down on air and global warming

pollution. In fact, the plan could increase the use of dirty coal, which

is a main source of smog and asthma-causing pollution.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our families will breathe cleaner air if we simply enforce existing laws,

rather than replace our good clean air protections with this weaker

scheme,&quot; said Pope.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">America can have cleaner air faster by not weakening current laws and by

supporting the Clean Power Act which was just approved by a key Senate

environmental committee. The Clean Power Act [S. 556], would reduce levels

of the four major pollutants: nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon

dioxide and mercury. Nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide will be reduced by

75 percent from 2000 levels, and mercury by 90 percent. Carbon dioxide is

capped at 1990 levels. All these new levels must be achieved by 2008. The

legislation also includes a &quot;birthday&quot; provision, which requires power

plants to install modern pollution control equipment by their 40th year of

operation, closing the much maligned &quot;grandfather&quot; loophole. The most

critical feature of this legislation is that, rather than seeking to

eliminate existing protections, it reduces pollution from power plants as

an additional protection.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The irresponsible Bush Administration plan simply won't do the job,&quot;

continued Pope. &quot;The Administration's plan fails to curb carbon dioxide,

the chief global warming pollutant. This ill-advised scheme also falls far

short of adequately protecting people's health and the environment from the

air pollution that cause lung diseases like asthma and lung cancer and

cause acid rain. The plan leaves local communities at risk to serious

pollution in their backyard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club urges people across the country to call their members of

Congress and ask them to oppose this irresponsible piece of legislation and

instead support Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act.
