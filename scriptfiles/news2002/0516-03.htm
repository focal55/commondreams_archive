<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - May 16 - About 120,000 additional 

illegal gun sales could be prevented each year by improving federal 

background check laws, according to a new report released today by 

the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence and a coalition of law 

enforcement and public health organizations. The report cites the 

effectiveness of criminal background checks, and recommends that 

Congress extend the provisions of the Brady Act, which requires 

background checks on sales by licensed dealers, to all gun sales, 

including sales at gun shows and via the Internet. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This report by the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence 

contains some important -- and timely -- findings, considering our 

current national priorities,&quot; said Sen. Dianne Feinstein 

(D-Calif.). &quot;The numbers are clear -- criminal background checks 

work. And if we want police and prosecutors to better enforce the 

law and stop those who supply guns to criminals, we must extend our 

effective national background check system to cover all gun sales.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current federal law requires criminal background checks only for 

sales conducted by federally licensed gun dealers. This policy 

prevented almost 700,000 illegal gun sales through licensed firearm 

dealers from 1994 through 2000, but left 40 percent of 

transactions, many of which took place at gun shows, via classified 

ads, and over the Internet, completely unregulated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report shows that if the current rejection rate for 

attempted purchases from licensed dealers also applied to 

non-dealer transactions each year, an additional 119,680 illegal 

gun transactions would be prevented annually. Experts pointed out 

that this figure may underestimate the number of illegal sales that 

could be prevented, since criminals are more likely to try to 

purchase guns from non-dealer sources. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The loopholes in criminal background check laws in many states 

help support a vast, profitable, and deadly illegal gun market,&quot; 

said Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Educational Fund to 

Stop Gun Violence. &quot;Expanding background checks to all sales -- 

especially those at gun shows -- will help save lives, without 

impeding the ability of law-abiding Americans to buy and sell 

guns.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new report recommends a comprehensive federal policy 

requiring criminal background checks for all gun transactions, 

regardless of where they occur. </font></p>
