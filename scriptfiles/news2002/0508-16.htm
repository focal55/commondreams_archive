- May 8 - The House Armed Services Committee is sending a bill to the House floor this week that endorses a major expansion of the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a series of decisions made during the mark-up of the fiscal 2003 Defense Authorization bill last week, the Committee recommended the following steps: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Exploring nuclear-armed interceptors for a National Missile Defense [report language] </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Developing nuclear weapons to target underground targets, weapons of mass destruction and production facilities of such weapons [section 1021]; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Storing nuclear weapons removed from active deployment in order to have them available for later deployment [section 1021]; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Speeding up preparations for resuming nuclear testing [section 1021]; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Prodding the Bush Administration not to reduce deployed strategic nuclear weapons below 1,700 [section 1021]; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Developing a plan to produce new and more effective nuclear weapons [section 1021]; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">John Isaacs, president of Council for a Livable World, stated: &quot;In the aftermath of the Cold War, it is in the United States interest to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy. What the Committee is trying to do is move the most destructive weapons ever invented back into the mainstream of American security policy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has undertaken to reduce and de-emphasize its nuclear forces while greatly improving its conventional weapons capabilities. Today no other nation can match the United States in overall military spending - the anticipated fiscal 2003 military budget of almost $400 billion is more than the combined defense expenditures of every other country in the world. This superiority in non-nuclear weapons has led some former hard-liners such as Paul Nitze to recommend abolition of nuclear weapons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet the House Armed Services Committee -- and perhaps the full House on Thursday -- is embracing developing &quot;usable&quot; nuclear weapons with perceived military value, a policy which will encourage other states to pursue similar capabilities. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If Congress and the Administration adopt these policies, they will undermine U.S. security by encouraging other states to pursue nuclear weapons, and thereby increase the likelihood that nuclear weapons will actually be used,&quot; argued Isaacs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The full House should reject these dangerous and misguided policies,&quot; concluded Isaacs. </font></p>
