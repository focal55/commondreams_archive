- July 25 - As the Nation prepares to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Americans 

with Disabilities Act (ADA) and honor the life of Justin Dart, Jr., the Presidential 

Medal of Freedom recipient and recognized "Father of the ADA" who died just weeks 

ago, disability rights advocates are pausing to acknowledge the current attacks 

on the civil rights of people with disabilities in the Courts, Congress, and the 

Administration. 

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Perhaps most damaging," ADA Watch executive director Jim Ward explains, "is 

that President Bush has filled the ranks of the federal government -- and seeks 

to do the same with the court system -- with opponents of the ADA and other civil 

rights laws. Many of these individuals, Federalism and States' Rights extremists, 

have been cynically given the responsibility to enforce the very laws they have 

attacked. We call on President Bush to appoint individuals who will uphold Federal 

law protecting and empowering individuals with disabilities." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush-appointed opponents of the ADA and other disability rights laws include: </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Ohio lawyer Jeffrey Sutton nominated to a lifetime position on the Sixth 

Circuit Court of Appeals. Most recently, Sutton argued the University of Alabama 

v. Patricia Garrett case in the Supreme Court, producing a 5-4 decision that state 

employees who suffered discrimination could not sue under the ADA to seek damages 

from the state. More that 400 disability organizations have united under the ADA 

Watch Coalition to oppose this nomination. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Attorney General John Ashcroft who, as Senator, took the lead role in trying 

to weaken the due process protections afforded children and youth with disabilities 

by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Ashcroft's Justice 

Department has taken the wrong side in Supreme Court disability cases and has 

done little to enforce the ADA. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Gerald Reynolds, recess appointed by President Bush to run the Office of 

Civil Rights at the Department of Education (60 percent of OCR cases are disability-related). 

Reynolds told the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that the ADA is one of the "statutes 

and regulations (that) are going to retard economic development in urban centers 

across the country." (April 5, 1997) </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- D. Brooks Smith, a conservative activist nominated by Bush to the 3rd Circuit 

Court of Appeals, dismissed charges against institutions in Pennsylvania where 

horrific care of individuals with mental disabilities included flies and ants 

on food, maggots and ants on residents, residents sitting in wheelchairs for hours 

without having their diapers changed, injuries due to neglect, overmedicating, 

and more. Judge Smith concluded that the State had no constitutional obligation 

to "enhance the resident's level of functioning." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Eugene Scalia, Bush's controversial recess appointee to Solicitor at the 

Department of Labor. Scalia has made a career out of representing big business 

against employees and has sought to limit the scope of the ADA. He has called 

federal ergonomics regulations proposed to prevent disabilities in the workplace 

"junk science." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Bush's Interior Secretary, Gale Norton, who advocated for states' rights 

by claiming that "we lost too much" when the South was defeated in the Civil War. 

(Independence Institute Speech, 1996) Norton also threatened to sue the federal 

government for forcing Colorado to add a wheelchair ramp to the statehouse under 

the ADA, calling it "a really ugly addition to the state capitol." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Linda Chavez, Bush's first pick for Secretary of Labor, ridiculed the ADA 

as 'special treatment in the name of accommodating the disabled.'" (AP, Jan. 5, 

2001) Chavez runs the Center for Equal Opportunity (CEO), whose legal counsel, 

Roger Glegg, has repeatedly attacked the ADA for what he calls its "dubious rationale 

and its silly results" and believes Congress should at least exclude protections 

for people with "mental impairments." (The Public Interest, June 1st, 1999) </font></font>
