<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BERKELEY, CA / KIRKLAND 

LAKE, ONTARIO, CA - July 22 - The plan to import and burn dioxin/PCB contaminated 

waste at the proposed Bennett incinerator is drawing international heat. Representatives 

from 80 public interest groups in 29 countries have signed a petition condemning 

the Ontario Conservative plan to open Northern Ontario up to PCB import and burning. 

The petition, circulated by the Secretariat of the Global Alliance for Incinerator 

Alternatives (GAIA), draws particular attention to the woeful state of Ontario&#8217;s 

Environmental Assessment process.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monica Wilson, spokesperson 

for GAIA network, says the proposed Bennett incinerator is an issue that people 

everywhere need to be concerned about. &quot;As a violation of the Canadian Council 

of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) guidelines, and of basic common sense, 

we urge the Ontario government to turn down the application for the Bennett toxic 

waste incinerator. Instead of building new incinerators for toxic waste from other 

places, the government of Ontario should push for safer, non-incineration technology 

to treat PCBs and other toxic waste at the source.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If approved, the Bennett 

incinerator would be the largest of its kind in the country and handle toxic waste 

from across NAFTA designated countries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GAIA network has described 

the Northern Ontario/Quebec grassroots campaign against Bennett as &#8220;very 

inspiring.&#8221; The petition includes signatories from Argentina, Armenia, Bangladesh, 

Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, India, Ireland, Israel, 

Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa, 

South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, UK, Uruguay and the United 

States.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barb Bukowski, of Public 

Concern Temiskaming, says the international attention has been a real boost for 

northern residents.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been 

working full out to show this government that northern residents will not allow 

this project to go ahead,&#8221; says Bukowski. &#8220;Having international support 

means a great deal to people here. The Ontario government has to be held accountable 

for their disgraceful record in protecting the health and environment of this 

province.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PETITION TO ONTARIO PREMIER 

ERNIE EVES<br>

Whereas the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act has been significantly weakened 

with regard to the regulations concerning the siting of landfills, incinerators 

and other project proposals thereby allowing Northern Ontario to be unduly targeted 

as a waste zone and;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas American experience 

has shown that all, even state of the art incinerators, produce and emit, dioxins, 

furans, lead, mercury, and cadmium at levels that create significant measurable 

health impacts on the affected communities; and, Whereas the proposed Bennett 

incinerator is in violation of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment 

(CCME) guidelines;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We, the undersigned, petition 

you, as the Premier of the Province of Ontario, to turn down the current application 

for the Bennett toxic waste incinerator proposed for Kirkland Lake and;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We, the undersigned, further 

petition you, as Premier of the Province of Ontario, to replace the current Environmental 

Assessment Act with legislation that gives affected communities a full environmental 

assessment including intervenor funding, and a comprehensive and public hearing.</font></p>
