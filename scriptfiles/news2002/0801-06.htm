- August 1 - "TakeBackBaseball.com," a grassroots group of baseball fans sick 

of greed destroying the game they love, today announced results from its "BudMustGo.com" 

petition effort -- specifically, regarding who baseball fans want for the new 

commissioner. Leading the pack were former player Cal Ripken, Jr., and former 

NYC Mayor Rudloph Giuliani. (full results at <a href="http://www.BudMustGo.com" target="_new">http://www.BudMustGo.com</a>). 

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Judging from the poll and related feedback from our thousands of supporters, 

it is clear that baseball fans are looking for a Commissioner with two things," 

said Heather Holdridge, Team Captain of the group. "One, the integrity and intelligence 

to come up with a plan to solve baseball's problems, and two, the stature and 

will-power to make both sides accept it." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Top finishers in the poll were as follows: </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Cal Ripken, Jr.: 23.1 percent <br>

-- Rudolph Giuliani: 21.6 percent <br>

-- Hank Aaron: 10.6 percent <br>

-- Bob Costas: 8.3 percent (as a write-in) </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also high on the write-in list were former players Pete Rose and Frank Robinson, 

sports columnist Peter Gammons, former President Bill Clinton, and "anybody but 

Bud Selig." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bud Selig himself received only 1/10 of 1 percent of the vote, tying him with 

Vern "Mini Me" Troyer. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Full results of the poll are posted at <a href="http://www.BudMustGo.com" target="_new">http://www.BudMustGo.com</a>. </font>

</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TakeBackBaseball.com intends to continue 

taking fan feedback for the next few weeks on both its "BudMustGo.com" petition, 

and its "Who should be the new commissioner?" poll. It will then compile the results 

and deliver them to Bud Selig, and to each of the Major League Baseball owners.
