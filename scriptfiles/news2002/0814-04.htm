- August 14 - All too familiar with that burning sensation in their eyes and throat 

brought on by the smog in the air, Washington, DC area residents are suffering 

through the 33rd unhealthy air day of 2002 today, and for the fifth day in a row, 

air pollution levels have exceeded the federal health standard.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This morning, children, the elderly, people with asthma or heart disease, and 

even healthy adults heard a now-familiar warning to limit outdoor activity. This 

warning came as the U.S. EPA took another step toward weakening clean air rules 

to allow power plants, refineries and other major industrial sources of pollution 

to escape requirements to install modern pollution controls.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The smog that is choking Washington this summer should sound the alarm 

at the White House that this is not the time to retreat on clean air,&quot; said 

Rebecca Stanfield, Clean Air Advocate for U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 

&quot;Unfortunately for public health, even during a smog crisis, the Bush administration's 

dedication to the polluters' agenda appears unflinching,&quot; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on data from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, it has 

been unhealthy to breathe the air in the Washington DC area on ten of the last 

fourteen days. In addition:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During June, July and the first half of August, the air quality in the DC-area 

has been smoggy enough to create health problems nearly every other day.<br>

</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DC area air quality has been deemed &quot;good&quot; on only sixteen days 

since June 1, or on one out of every five days.<br>

</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Smog levels in the DC area exceeded the old, less-protective health standard 

that was replaced by EPA in 1997 eight times so far this year, tying with 1993 

for worst air quality in the last decade based on that standard.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to a report published yesterday by the Bureau of National Affairs, 

&quot;Changes to regulations that would allow companies to avoid enforcement actions 

under the new source review air pollution program were sent to the White House 

Office of Management and Budget Aug. 13 for review.&quot; This is the last step 

in the regulatory process before EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman signs 

the changes into law.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Administrator Whitman can still decide against signing this rollback,&quot; 

said Stanfield. &quot;If she's breathing the same air we're breathing this summer, 

she can find the will to stand up to the polluters and do the right thing for 

the public.&quot;</font></p>
