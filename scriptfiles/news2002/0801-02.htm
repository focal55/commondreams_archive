- August 1 - The Lavender Green Caucus, representing gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 

transgendered (GLBT) members of the Green Party, has emerged as a national force 

in the Green Party of the United States, after becoming the first caucus to gain 

a voting seat on the party's Coordinating Committee. Other caucuses, representing 

African-American and Latino Greens, are also planning to win seats on the Coordinating 

Committee, the party's central decision-making body which includes delegates from 

39 states.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The growth of identity caucuses with voting power within the party expands 

the power of people often excluded from political decisions, either because they 

represent minority constituencies or because of outright bias,&quot; said Badili 

Jones, an African-American and gay Green activist from Georgia who was elected 

to the national party's Steering Committee during the recent 2002 Midterm Convention 

of the Green Party of the United States in Philadelphia. &quot;The Democrats and 

Republicans don't allow such voting caucuses. Lavender, African-American, and 

Latino voters have a home with the Greens.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We're delighted to be the first official caucus of the Green Party,&quot; 

said Starlene Rankin of Illinois, the Lavender Green delegate in the party. &quot;We 

intend to fully participate and we won't be shy about bringing our issues to the 

table.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Greens demand Instant Runoff Voting and public campaign financing -- 

the kind of democratic reforms that won't just benefit third parties like the 

Greens, but minority voting constituencies of all kinds, including queers,&quot; 

Rankin explained. &quot;Move over, Stonewall Democrats and Log Cabin Republicans!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lavender Greens dispute the reputation of the Democratic Party as the defender 

of civil rights, recalling President Clinton's signature on the antigay Defense 

of Marriage Act in 1996 and Al Gore's declaration, during the 2000 presidential 

debates, that he opposed same-sex marriage rights.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout 2000, Green presidential candidate Ralph Nader reiterated his support 

for same-sex marriage, non-discrimination protections, and other equal rights 

for GLBT people. At a July 19 press conference at the recent 2002 Midterm Convention 

of the Green Party of the United States in Philadelphia, California Green gubernatorial 

candidate Peter Camejo included same-sex marriage rights in his list of priorities. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We dare GLBT voters and organizations to compare the Green platform with 

the Democrats and Republicans,&quot; said Greg Gerritt, Green candidate for mayor 

of Providence, Rhode Island. &quot;Greens say that, just as biological diversity 

is essential to the health of the planet, acceptance of human diversity is necessary 

for the social and psychological health of society. Diversity and feminism are 

key Green values. We demand legalized civil same-sex marriage rights; safe schools 

and other equal rights and protections for GLBT parents, children, and youth; 

repeal of restrictive immigration laws based on sexuality and HIV infection; medical 

marijuana and needle exchange; universal access to AIDS drugs; women's uncompromised 

right and access to abortion; and national health insurance.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Lavender Greens note numerous 

other Democratic betrayals, including President Clinton's 1993 'don't ask, don't 

tell' policy, under which witch hunts against gay people in the military skyrocketed. 

Clinton opposed medical marijuana and needle-exchange programs, and fired Surgeon 

General Joycelyn Elders for speaking frankly about safe sex. The Clinton Administration, 

goaded by U.S. pharmaceutical lobbies, threatened poor nations in Africa, Asia, 

and South America with economic sanctions for producing low-cost AIDS and other 

drugs. Clinton and Gore ended some of the threats after protests from ACT UP and 

the Global AIDS Project (with Green participation and a challenge from Ralph Nader).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Clinton Administration further angered many GLBT supporters by discarding 

the Democrats' pledge since 1948 to enact national health insurance, by blaming 

unmarried and teenage mothers for the nation's economic woes, and by Al Gore's 

call in 2000 for limits on reproductive freedom -- candidate Gore endorsed outlawing 

late-term abortion rights (U.S. Catholic Conference questionnaire, October, 2000).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;After nearly a decade of promise to pass national anti-bias legislation, 

Democrats failed to advance it, wasting years in which they controlled both Congress 

and the White House,&quot; said Vivian Houghton, Green Party candidate for Delaware 

Attorney General. &quot;Furthermore, the current version of the Employee Anti-Discrimination 

Act omits transgendered Americans. Now we have a President who's openly hostile 

to all such discussion, while Democrats have taken every opportunity to support 

the Bush-Ashcroft assaults on the basic rights enshrined in the Constitution. 

GLBT Americans are ready for a new party, one dedicated to all our rights and 

liberties.&quot;</font></p>
