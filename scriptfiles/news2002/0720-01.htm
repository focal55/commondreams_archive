<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - July 20 - The 

United States is set to defy its allies on another critical human rights treaty, 

warned Human Rights Watch as the United Nations debates a new treaty to prevent 

torture.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the organization's governing 

body for human rights, will next week debate a draft Optional Protocol to the 

Convention Against Torture. The new treaty would establish an international system 

of inspection visits to places of detention, but would only apply to those countries 

that ratify it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current text has been put forward by Costa Rica and enjoys wide support 

from ECOSOC members, including members of the European Union and many Latin American, 

Caribbean and African states. But the United States has signaled its opposition 

and wants negotiations on the text re-opened.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Yet again the Bush Administration is on a collision course with its 

allies over an important new mechanism to protect human rights,&#8221; said Rory 

Mungoven, Global Advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. &#8220;Last week, it 

was the International Criminal Court, this week, it's the prevention of torture.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch said the draft Optional Protocol represented the best compromise 

possible after ten years of difficult negotiations. It addressed many of the concerns 

previously raised by governments, including the United States.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. government has objected to the proposal, claiming that prison visits 

by an international body would be too intrusive. But the system of visits has 

many checks and balances, ensuring consultation with governments, prior-notification 

of visits and the confidentiality of reports. It can be adapted to different legal 

cultures, including federal systems. And if the U.S. government didn&acute;t ratify 

the new treaty, it would not face any inspections at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch warned that the U.S. proposal to re-open negotiations on 

the draft would be the kiss-of-death for the treaty. Abusive governments, many 

of which have not even signed the Convention Against Torture, would use further 

negotiations to water down or block the adoption of the protocol.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;By sending this treaty for more negotiations, the United States would 

be playing into the hands of countries such as Cuba and Iran, which want to block 

international scrutiny of human rights,&#8221; Mungoven said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch said the U.S. government should not oppose or delay adoption 

of the protocol, even if it chose not to ratify the treaty itself.</font></p>
