- June 14 - More than two hundred National Association of Black Organizations 
(NABO) and National Action Network (NAN) demonstrators watched in horror as four 
fellow demonstrators including a grandmother and two children, were run down by 
a car in front of XM Satellite Radio's Washington, D.C., headquarters. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The extent of the injuries is not known. The injured were 
transported by ambulance to the hospital. A male adult hit by the 
car suffered head injuries and was moved by stretcher to an 
ambulance. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A number of police cars, ambulances and fire trucks responded to 
the accident and the front of XM Satellite was cordoned off with 
yellow police crime scene tape. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of the demonstration was to highlight NABO and NAN's 
national campaign to have the nation's satellite and cable 
broadcasting industry provide value positive programming for 
African Americans. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NABO/NAN is disappointed with the results of prior discussions 
with XM executives. Those discussions focused on NABO/NAN concerns 
that XM Satellite Radio programming reflects a glaring lack of 
positive programming options to those XM channels that glorify the 
cultures of violence, drugs and female debasement that is pervasive 
in urban America. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We pray for the injured that were fighting for value positive 
programming. That is why we respect broadcast giants such as 
DirecTV, Comcast Cable, Charter Communications, Time Warner, The 
Armed Forces Network and AT&amp;T who have set the tone for corporate 
broadcast responsibility by agreeing to carry value positive 
programming such as The Word Network,&quot; said Reverend Horace 
Sheffield III, CEO of NABO and the president the Michigan Chapter 
of NAN. Sheffield also commended Sirius Satellite Radio for being 
sensitive to value positive programming. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NABO/NAN crisis management consultant Sam Riddle said that the 
demonstrators will return to XM and that civil disobedience may be 
the order of the day. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;XM has made a racist effort to pit NABO/NAN against a business 
concern, Radio One, that is headed by a female African American 
entrepreneur. The mind-boggling nature of satellite radio 
plantation politics will not endure. No one individual or broadcast 
entity is endowed to be the broadcast gatekeeper for the African 
American community. We will stand strong for value positive 
programming that brings urban ministries to satellite radio even if 
it means going to jail-again,&quot; said Riddle. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NABO and NAN demonstrations for value positive satellite 
broadcast programming in Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Missouri, 
Warren and Novi, Michigan, Denver, Colorado, and New York have 
attracted hundreds that marched in protest with some demonstrators 
being jailed for civil disobedience. </font></p>
