- May 15 - The majority of anti-choice 

voters strongly agree that students should receive sex education 

that includes abstinence and contraception throughout their school 

years, according to a 2002 poll of registered voters, commissioned 

by the Othmer Institute at Planned Parenthood of NYC. Ninety 

percent of all respondents agreed that students should receive 

age-appropriate and medically accurate sex education that begins in 

the early grades and continues through twelfth grade. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite such findings, the House of Representatives is poised to 

pass legislation that trades medical accuracy and effective 

programs for conservative ideology. A provision of the proposed 

House welfare reauthorization bill would provide federal funding 

for medically incomplete abstinence programs. The legislation is 

part of a larger effort by the Bush Administration to increase 

federal funding for such programs by 35 percent. Typically called 

abstinence-only, these programs only discuss contraception as it 

relates to failure rates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the majority of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents 

prefer sex education programs to abstinence-only programs, the 

House Commerce Committee voted largely along party lines to shoot 

down amendments that would have required abstinence programs to be 

medically accurate and states to use programs that have been shown 

to work. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Such votes are driven by narrow ideology, rather than what 

Americans want and need to be healthy,&quot; said Gloria Feldt, 

President, Planned Parenthood Federation of America. &quot;How else 

could you explain President Bush mandating a national curriculum 

that the majority of voters don't support? Despite the President's 

on-the-record claims to spend money on what works, he is 

aggressively advocating for programs deemed ineffective by health 

care experts. In so doing, he is putting our children in grave 

danger.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also uncovered that almost half of all voters believe 

that abstinence-only programs present all the facts on birth 

control and disease prevention. Critics claim that this confusion 

has allowed the Bush Administration to advocate for a program that 

is so far out of step with voter opinion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans overwhelmingly support sex education-education that 

includes information about abstinence and contraception,&quot; said 

Leslie Kantor, Vice President of Education for the Othmer Institute 

at Planned Parenthood of NYC. &quot;In fact, voters find the idea of 

teaching sex education without contraception and disease prevention 

so ludicrous that they can't believe the federal government is 

funding it.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll also found that the majority of voters believe 

decisions about the content of sex education programs should be 

made at the local and state levels. Yet, the House Commerce 

Committee vetoed an amendment that would have given states more 

flexibility in how best to spend the money. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, the Bush Administration is about to face an 

unlikely foe in this matter, which is often framed as a debate 

between morality and public health. Religious leaders are preparing 

to release an open letter supporting comprehensive sex education. 

The letter, developed at a colloquium of theologians sponsored by 

the Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing, 

provides compelling religious reasons for supporting comprehensive 

sex education. In addition, more than 2,100 clergy, theologians and 

other religious leaders have endorsed a Religious Declaration, 

which calls in part for lifelong, age-appropriate sexuality education in schools, seminaries, and community settings. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There currently is no federal program dedicated to supporting 

effective sex education that emphasizes the benefits of abstinence 

while also teaching about contraception and pregnancy and disease 

prevention, despite the proven effectiveness of such programs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The poll was conducted by Lake Snell Perry &amp; Associates and 

commissioned by the Othmer Institute at Planned Parenthood of NYC. 

The survey reached 800 active and attentive voters nationwide (400 

men and 400 women). Active and attentive voters were defined as 

individuals who said they were likely to vote in the 2002 elections 

for Congress; who had voted in all or most of the elections in 

which they had been eligible to vote; who read the newspaper daily; 

who participate in a volunteer, community or civic, or political 

organization at least once a month; who pay attention to politics 

and government; and who would write a letter to their member of 

Congress on an issue that concerned them. The survey was conducted 

between February 13 and 18, 2002. The margin of error is 

3.5 percent. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Othmer Institute is dedicated to promoting the advancement 

of reproductive freedom and healthy sexuality through innovative 

programs and ideas. The Institute's objective is to bring new 

energy into the public discourse and create a forum for meaningful 

change, building a national center of civic dialogue where morally 

complex issues can be debated freely.
