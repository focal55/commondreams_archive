President of Conscience International, a humanitarian aid organization, Jennings 

has led medical and public health workshops in Iraqi hospitals since 1991, training 

500 Iraqi doctors and nurses in child survival techniques. He said today: "Any 

new war with Iraq would only bring a fresh humanitarian catastrophe. We are still 

dealing with the devastating effects of the last war and the subsequent harsh 

embargo on vulnerable women, children, and the aged. Since the Gulf War, the death 

rate for children under age 5 in Iraq has risen from 56 per thousand to 131 per 

thousand. One in every eight Iraqi children dies before his or her first birthday. 

Sixty percent of mothers are anemic, and one child in three suffers from chronic 

malnutrition. The incidence of childhood cancer and leukemia has more than tripled 

in the Basra governorate..."</p> </font>

Mahajan is author of <i>The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism</i> and the 

forthcoming <i>Desert Deception: Myths and Realities About the War on Iraq</i>. 

Mahajan said today: "Myths impede discussion about Iraq. Myths like: The economic 

sanctions would be lifted if only Iraq had complied with the weapons inspectors. 

(The U.S. government repeatedly stated the sanctions would continue regardless.) 

Myths like: Inspectors are not in Iraq because Iraq kicked them out in December 

of 1998. (Actually they were withdrawn by UNSCOM head Richard Butler, just before 

the Desert Fox bombing campaign.) It was also under Butler's watch that inspectors 

were used for espionage, something many have forgotten about. Also, the Pentagon 

continues to bomb Iraq about once a week in the 'no-fly' zones. These hearings 

add more layers of myth instead of unraveling them."</p> </font>
