- May 29 - &quot;The settlement announced today by the Department of Interior on Destin Dome is one of the most significant victories in the 20 year battle to keep Florida's coast rig free.  Chevron's efforts to open Florida's coastline to full-scale drilling activity were the most imminent threat to Florida's environment. It would have forever changed the environmental and economic landscape of our coastline.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We applaud the decision to end that threat and urge the Bush administration to protect the rest of Florida's coastline and sensitive areas around the country from inappropriate oil and gas drilling</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allowing the oil and gas industry to &quot;rig&quot; our coastline would have generated millions in profits for the companies themselves.  Floridians would have gotten nothing in return except a polluted and despoiled marine environment. Florida's marine environment is inextricably linked to the health of our economy and our quality of life.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We applaud Governor Bush, Senators Graham and Nelson and our U.S. Representatives for opposing drilling off of Florida.  Floridians have been united in our resolve to protect the unique and fragile environment of our state.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the most immediate threat has been negated, dozens of other active leases remain near shore off the Florida coast.  Today's announcement sends a clear message to the companies holding those leases that pursuing exploration or production of oil and gas off the Florida coast would be like throwing money down a well.  They maintain a foothold off our coast and though they may be only hanging on by a toe, the door needs to be permanently shut.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Bush should support permanent protection for our coast and other fragile areas around the United States.&quot;</font></p>
