- May 8 - The Sierra Club today applauded the 117 members of the

House of Representatives who stood up for public health and the environment

by voting against a dangerous proposal to store nuclear waste at Nevada's

Yucca Mountain.  Though the measure passed the House, it now faces greater

opposition in the Senate.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These lawmakers had the courage to put the health and safety of current

and future generations ahead of short-term political expediency,&quot; said Carl

Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.  &quot;Every day, we learn more

about the grave threat to public health and the environment that this

unsound scheme poses.  Americans don't want convoys of nuclear waste on

their roads and rails.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan, which is being backed by the powerful nuclear industry, calls for

thousands of tons of highly radioactive nuclear waste to be transported

across the country on trucks, trains, and barges.  It would then be dumped

at Yucca Mountain, just ninety miles from Las Vegas, America's fastest

growing city.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">100,000 shipments of nuclear waste would be made over the next 31 years,

making accidents all but certain.  Millions of Americans would be

needlessly threatened with exposure to highly radioactive material in the

event of an accident or terrorist attack.  The choice of Yucca Mountain

itself rests on shaky science - the mountain leaks, meaning that nuclear

waste could seep into the groundwater, jeopardizing the health of hundreds

of thousands of local residents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn vetoed the proposal a month ago, sending the

issue to Congress.  Now both Houses must vote to over-ride Governor Guinn's

veto if the plan is to go forward.  The Senate is expected to take up the

issue in June.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A broad coalition of environmental, public interest, and taxpayer groups

has joined with the state of Nevada and a growing number of elected

officials from Washington state to Massachusetts to oppose the plan.</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Yucca Mountain proposal would set in motion a high-stakes game of

nuclear Russian roulette,&quot; continued Pope.  &quot;The plan puts the wishes of

the nuclear industry ahead of the health and safety of ordinary Americans.&quot;
