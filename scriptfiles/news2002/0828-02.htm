<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - August 28 - September 

11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows will co-sponsor a dusk to dawn vigil at Washington 

Square Park in Manhattan in commemoration of the terrorist attacks that took the 

lives of their lost loved ones, as well as others who have lost their lives to 

violence. Peaceful Tomorrows members Colleen Kelly, Talat Hamdani, David Potorti, 

and Andrew Rice will be present at the gathering, along with family members of 

those affected by violence in other countries. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scheduled to appear are: 

Michael Moore (filmmaker and author); Amy Goodman, (host of Pacifica Radio's "Democracy 

Now"); Kathy Kelly (Voices in the Wilderness); Manning Marable (Director of the 

Institute for Research in African-American studies at Columbia University); Michael 

Ratner (Center for Constitutional Rights and an attorney for Guantanamo detainees); 

Debbie Almontaser (Muslim American Society); Masuda Sultan, an Afghan-American 

who lost 19 relatives in the U.S.-led bombing; Father Daniel Berrigan, S.J.; Luong 

Ung, Cambodian refugee and author; satirist Reverend Billy; and musicians including 

Pat Humphries, Sandy Opatow and others. A special written message from Muhammad 

Ali also will be read.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"September 11th must not 

continue to be used to promote more war and violence," said Colleen Kelly, Peaceful 

Tomorrows' New York area coordinator, who lost her brother, William, at the World 

Trade Center that day. "This first anniversary, let us initiate an exploration 

of what it will take to bring healing and wholeness to our world. It is in remembering 

the universality of our grief that we shape our hope for a future of peaceful 

tomorrows." </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The program will take place 

from 7pm-10pm on September 10. A candlelight vigil will continue through the night, 

with closing observances beginning early on the morning of September 11. </font></p>

families that were affected by the U.S. military campaign.</font></p>
