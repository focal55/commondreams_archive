<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - May 16 - Social conservative 

policymakers are facing an unexpected foe as the debate for federal 

funding of sex education heats up. Religious leaders are advocating 

for sex education that includes abstinence and contraception. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While sex education is often framed as a &quot;morals versus public 

health&quot; argument, religious leaders are preparing to release an 

open letter providing a religious context for supporting 

comprehensive sexuality education programs and opposing 

abstinence-only programs. Stating that &quot;scriptural and theological 

commitment to telling the truth calls for full and honest education 

about sexual and reproductive health,&quot; the letter rejects the 

notion that abstinence-only is a religious response. It was 

developed at a colloquium of theologians sponsored by the Religious 

Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There is a false assumption that the religious community is in 

lock-step with the abstinence-only community. They are not,&quot; said 

Debra W. Haffner, M.Div., co-director of the Religious Institute on 

Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing. &quot;This letter provides the 

religious rationale for supporting sexually education-most 

importantly offering young people the truth and helping them 

develop a freely informed conscience. Programs that teach 

abstinence exclusively and withhold information fail the nation's 

young people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the House of Representatives poised to pass legislation 

that trades medical accuracy and effective programs for 

conservative ideology, many in the religious community are anxious 

to voice their dissent. More than 2100 clergy, theologians and 

other religious leaders have already endorsed the Religious 

Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing, which calls 

in part for lifelong, age appropriate sexuality education in 

schools, seminaries, and community settings. (For a list of 

endorsers, visit www.religiousinstitute.org) And more than 850 

clergy have signed Planned Parenthood's PPFA Clergy Advisory Board 

Statement on Comprehensive Sexuality Education calling for 

comprehensive sexuality education in schools and opposing 

abstinence-only education. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A provision of the proposed House welfare reauthorization bill 

would provide federal funding for medically incomplete abstinence 

programs. The legislation is part of a larger effort by the Bush 

Administration to increase federal funding for such programs by 35 

percent. Typically called abstinence-only, these programs are only 

permitted to discuss contraception as it relates to failure rates. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expressing dismay at such an approach, the letter opens with: 

&quot;As religious leaders, we have a continuing commitment to the 

spiritual, emotional, and physical health of the nation's young 

people. Now we are called to join in the public discussion about 

the nature of sexuality education for the country's youth. Strong 

public health arguments support comprehensive sexuality education. 

Here we invite you to consider the religious foundations for 

supporting sexuality education-education that respects the whole 

person, honors the truth and diverse values, and promotes the 

highest ethical values in human relationships.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter was developed by Rev. Mark Bigelow, Congregational 

Church of Huntington, L.I.; Rev. Dr. John Buehrens, Unitarian 

Universalist Association; Rev. Dr. Ignacio Casuera, Pacific 

Palisades United Methodist Church; Rev. Steve Clapp, Christian 

Community; Rev. Dr. Mark Ellison, Bangor Theological Seminary; 

Rabbi Sue Levi Elwell, Union of American Hebrew Congregations; Rev. 

Dr. Larry Greenfield, Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, 

Justice, and Healing; Debra W. Haffner, M.Div., Religious Institute 

on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing; Ann Hanson, Justice and 

Witness Ministries, United Church of Christ; Rev. Dr. Sheron 

Patterson, St. Paul United Methodist Church, Dallas; and Rev. 

Carlton Veazey, Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Religious leaders aren't the only ones thwarting conventional 

opinion. The majority of those who define themselves as anti-choice 

also strongly agree that students should receive sex education that 

includes abstinence and contraception throughout their school 

years, according to a 2002 poll of registered voters, commissioned 

by the Othmer Institute at Planned Parenthood of NYC. In addition, 

eighty five percent of all respondents agreed that students should 

receive age-appropriate and medically accurate information about 

contraception and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There currently is no federal program dedicated to supporting 

sex education that includes responsible, age-appropriate and 

medically-accurate instruction emphasizing the benefits of 

abstinence while also teaching about contraception and pregnancy 

and disease-prevention, despite the proven effectiveness of such 

programs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing 

was formed in April 2001 to promote the vision and goals of the 

Religious Declaration on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing. 

The Religious Declaration is a consensus statement created by 

theologians and ethicists from a broad range of religious 

traditions and currently endorsed by over 2,100 religious leaders 

across the United States. The Institute supports an expanding 

religious network of clergy, religious educators, theologians, 

ethicists, and other religious leaders committed to this vision of 

religion and sexuality. It builds the capacity of religious 

institutions and clergy to offer sexuality education within the 

context of their own faith traditions and to advocate for sexual 

rights; and educates the public and policy makers about this vision 

of sexual morality, justice, and healing. </i></font></p>
