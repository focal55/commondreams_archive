- September 7 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), the oldest advocacy 

organization for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) community in 

the United States, today celebrated a sea change in reaction to gay civil rights 

activism by organized communities of faith. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are here in Miami where 25 years ago Anita Bryant fell to her knees 

and weepingly prayed at the steps of a local church and launched the &quot;Save 

our Children&quot; campaign-a direct and libelous assault on the civil rights 

of the gay and lesbian community, said Lorri L. Jean, NGLTF Executive Director. 

&quot;By doing so in Miami, she set the stage for the formation of organizations 

like the Moral Majority, Christian Coalition and many other conservative institutions 

that have for decades used the name of God to forward a campaign of hate and bigotry 

on behalf of communities of faith nationwide.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On September 10, voters in Miami will again go to the polls to decide on the 

very issue that Anita Bryant led in 1977: whether or not protections from discrimination 

based on sexual orientation should be removed from the county's human rights ordinance. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Once again, religious fanatics are trying to force their brand of bigotry 

on everyone. In 1977 it was Anita Bryant. Today, it is the Christian Coalition 

and the Family Research Council leading the homophobic charge,&quot; continued 

Jean. &quot;Thankfully, that is where the similarity ends.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, on August 11, more than 175 local people of faith organized and 

went door to door in precincts throughout Miami-Dade County, talking to people 

from a religious perspective about why discrimination is wrong and urging them 

to oppose discrimination by voting no on Question 14 on Tuesday's ballot. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, the current pastor of a church that, years ago, Anita Bryant called 

home, led the opening prayer at the canvass orientation. &quot;Religious leaders 

and people of faith can no longer stand idly by and let the religious extremists 

speak for all of us, especially when most of us oppose discrimination,&quot; said 

the Rev. Dr. Annette Jones, now pastor of St. John's First United Methodist Church 

in Miami Beach. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Monday night, Sept. 9, Jones and the Interfaith Coalition for Human Rights, 

along with NGLTF, Save Dade, and People For the American Way, will co-sponsor 

a people of faith candlelight vigil. It will begin at 7 PM at Trinity Cathedral, 

464 NE 16th St., Miami. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is all great news to Rodney McKenzie, a campaign volunteer who traveled 

from New York City to help defeat Tuesday's ballot measure. &quot;When I was 16, 

I came out to my pastor and he told me I was going to hell,&quot; McKenzie remembered. 

&quot;It's a relief to see that religious leaders are coming around to what I 

always knew-God is on our side.&quot; </font></p>
