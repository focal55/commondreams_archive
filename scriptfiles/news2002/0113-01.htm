Fired and Banned Staff at New York&#146;s WBAI<br>

Chooses New National Executive Director</font></div>

<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK - January 13 - On Saturday, meeting in front of a cheering standing-room only 

crowd of over 500, the Interim Pacifica National Board (I-PNB) voted 

overwhelmingly to “reinstate” thirty-seven former WBAI staff and management 

fired, banned, suspended, or driven from their former positions since 

December 22, 2000. Citing WBAI Interim General Manager Robert Daughtry’s 

refusal to broadcast “Democracy Now!,” the board removed Daughtry because he 

“flagrantly defied the I-PNB directive.” 



<p>“The resolution to undo the December 2000, “Christmas Coup” is an historic 

event in independent media history, and is the first step in the reclaiming 

the network,” said Miguel Maldonado, WBAI Local Advisory Chair. “We look 

forward to the full democratization of the network”, he added.



<p>In addition to addressing the WBAI crisis, the board appointed former 

Pacifica Network News Director Dan Coughlin as interim executive director. 

Coughlin had been removed from his position because he authorized a story 

about the boycott of Pacifica stations by affiliates to protest against 

network's managers shut down KPFA of Berkeley in late 1999. That shut down 

caused the largest protests in Berkeley since the Vietnam War. Coughlin 

joined the Pacifica Campaign in January 2001.



<p>Pacifica Radio has been embroiled in controversy since those protests in 

1999. In December 2000, Pacifica "re-programmed" its New York City station, 

WBAI, by firing and banning long-time programmers and eviscerating the 

station's progressive political programming. Last August, Pacifica suspended 

Amy Goodman and removed Democracy Now! from the Pacifica airwaves.



<p>In dramatic point-counterpoint session the Pacifica Board received detailed 

reports from the station managers, chairs of the Local Advisory Board, and 

listeners from all five of the networks stations:  WBAI in New York, WPFW in 

Washington, DC, KPFA in Berkeley, KPFT in Houston and KPFK in Los Angeles.  



<p>KPFK General Manager Mark Schubb reported that the Los Angeles station’s 

transmitter has been operating at a fraction of its normal power because the 

network’s national office had taken the specifically allocated money for its 

replacement and used it for their own purposes. Schubb speculated it was to 

pay the network’s legal fees from the lawsuits by listeners and local 

advisory board members. 



<p>KPFK’s Local Advisory Board chair David Adelson rebutted Schubb’s claims of 

dramatically increasing listenership. Speakers representing listener 

organizations from the Los Angeles area called for Schubb’s immediate 

suspension for refusing to broadcast Democracy Now! at both of it’s regular 

time-slots after being directed to by the Pacifica management, broadcasting 

deliberate misinformation to listeners regarding the current board and 

banning and firing over 100 staff, volunteers and programmers in a 

retailitory fashion. 



<p>The national board scheduled its next meeting for the weekend of March 9-11th 

in Los Angeles.



<p>Houston’s Local Advisory Board was directed to get in compliance with PNB 

regulations regarding membership by weeks end.



<p>IPNB member Wendell Johns, an Executive at Fannie Mae from the former ruling 

majority, interim Executive Director JoAnn Meredith and Houston General 

Manager Garland Ganter all resigned in the week before the board meeting. 

Tomorrow Democracy Now! is slated to be broadcast on all 5 stations at it’s 

regular times.
