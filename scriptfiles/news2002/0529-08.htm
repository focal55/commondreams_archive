- May 29 - The Israeli-Palestinian Bereaved Families Forum will 

be sending an official delegation, headed by Mr. Yitzhak Frankenthal and Mr. 

Ibrahim Bushnaq, to Washington, DC from June 5-7 to deliver their message of 

reconciliation and peace to the American public.  The delegation will be 

available for interviews with the media.  To arrange an interview, please 

contact Josh Ruebner at the above-listed numbers.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bereaved Families Forum is composed of the Parents&#146; Circle, an 

organization of more than 200 Israeli families whose children have died in 

the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and who have joined together in a unique 

partnership to advance peace, tolerance and democracy.  The Parent&#146;s Circle 

was founded by Yitzhak Frankenthal in 1994, following the abduction and 

murder of his19-year old son Arik Frankenthal by Hamas terrorists. The 

Parents' Circle promotes peace and coexistence through education for 

tolerance and compromise. By promoting the Jewish moral obligation to 

preserve and value human life above all else, the Parents' Circle is at the 

forefront of explaining the human toll paid because of the absence of peace.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, The Parents&#146; Circle established a partnership with Palestinian 

bereaved families in Gaza and established the Israeli &#150; Palestinian Bereaved 

Families Forum for Peace. In addition, the Bereaved Families Forum works 

with groups of bereaved families all over the West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The work of the Bereaved Families Forum is predicated upon a compelling 

message: &quot;If we, who have lost our children, the most precious thing of all, 

can sit down with our enemies to discuss a way to end this bloody conflict, 

then our leaders must be able to as well.&quot;  Toward that end, the forum has 

met numerous times with presidents and prime ministers, ministers and 

diplomats to pressure leaders to make peace.  They have also carried out the 

only joint media campaign for peace to take place in Israel and the 

Palestinian Authority simultaneously. The main activity of the Families 

Forum is to publicly campaign for a peace agreement that will resolve the 

conflict and open a new chapter in Israeli-Palestinian relations.</font></p>
