- September 16 - With discussions about possible military action in Iraq increasingly 

dominating the international arena, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International 

Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) today cautioned governments not to stray from 

their obligations under the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. The week-long Fourth Meeting 

of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty opens today in Geneva.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;As the world seems relentlessly 

driven to the brink of war, we are increasingly concerned that some governments 

that have banned antipersonnel mines will find themselves engaged in joint military 

operations with U.S. military forces using mines. The last time the United States 

used antipersonnel mines was against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War,&#8221; said Jody 

Williams, co-recipient of peace prize with the ICBL.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. has not joined the Mine 

Ban Treaty, though its current policy is to try to do so by 2006. All other members 

of NATO are party to the treaty except Greece (which has signed) and Turkey, which 

are on the verge of fulfilling their promise to join simultaneously. Other likely 

military partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, are also States Parties.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICBL believes that participation 

in joint operations with an armed force that uses antipersonnel mines is clearly 

against the spirit of the Mine Ban Treaty, and possibly a violation of the treaty 

obligation not to assist in any way with the use of antipersonnel mines by anyone 

else. The ICBL calls on State Parties to insist that non-signatories do not use 

antipersonnel mines in joint operations, and to refuse to take part in any joint 

operations that involve use of antipersonnel mines.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The United States should not 

use antipersonnel mines in Iraq or elsewhere. At the least, it should pledge now 

not to use antipersonnel mines in joint operations with Mine Ban Treaty countries, 

thereby putting them at risk of violating the treaty,&#8221; said Ms. Williams.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICBL also expressed concerns 

about the antipersonnel mines that the United States has stockpiled in five States 

Parties (Germany, Japan, Norway, Qatar, and the United Kingdom at Diego Garcia), 

and the possibility of the U.S. transiting mines across the territory of States 

Parties for possible use in Iraq. Qatar has been identified in media reports as 

a likely headquarters for future U.S. military action in Iraq.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In its opening speech to 

the annual meeting of States Parties, the ICBL congratulated governments for the 

tremendous progress made in the five years since the Mine Ban Treaty was negotiated 

in Oslo in September 1997. It said that the overall record of compliance with 

and implementation of the treaty has been very good.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The head of the ICBL delegation, 

Stephen Goose of Human Rights Watch, stated, &#8220;On 18 September 1997, when 

President Selebi of South Africa gaveled the negotiations closed, the ICBL hailed 

the Mine Ban Treaty as a &#8216;gift to humanity.&#8217;&#8221; Since that day, 

three-quarters of the world&#8217;s nations have formally committed to the Mine 

Ban Treaty, and many other nations are poised to join in the near future. Since 

that day, some 30 million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed. 

Since that day, not a single nation has openly traded antipersonnel mines, and 

it appears that fewer than a dozen countries have produced antipersonnel mines. 

Far fewer governments are now using antipersonnel mines. Global funding for mine 

action programs over the past five years totaled more than $1 billion, or more 

than three times that of the previous five years. The number of new mine victims 

each year has significantly decreased, from an estimated 26,000 per year to an 

estimated 15-20,000 per year. We have changed the reality on the ground, which 

is of course the most meaningful measure of the success of the Mine Ban Treaty.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the other concerns and challenges 

highlighted by the ICBL were:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Universalization: 

126 countries are now States Parties, with Afghanistan joining on 11 September 

2002. Another 18 have signed but not yet ratified. Still, 50 nations are outside 

the treaty, including the U.S., Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and Egypt.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Non-state actors 

(rebel groups) are now responsible for much of the mine use around the world, 

including in at least fourteen countries since May 2001. Much more needs to be 

done by governments and non-governmental organizations to educate and convince 

NSAs on banning antipersonnel mines.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Takijistan, a State 

Party since April 2000, has not been meeting its treaty obligations. Russian forces 

have laid mines inside Tajikistan, on the Tajik border with Afghanistan, with 

the apparent consent of the Tajik government.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Rwandan forces 

in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been cooperating closely with RCD rebels, 

who have admitted to mine use in 2002; this raises questions about possible joint 

military operations that would not be consistent with the Mine Ban Treaty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; States Parties 

have not adequately addressed the issue of antivehicle mines with sensitive fuzes 

or antihandling devices, which should be considered banned under the terms of 

the Mine Ban Treaty. Some States, such as the UK, Germany, and France, insist 

the weapons are not prohibited.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; Some States Parties, 

including Djibouti, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, appear to be in danger of not 

meeting their deadlines for completion of stockpile destruction in early 2003.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; In 2001, global 

funding for mine action programs stagnated, totaling $237 million. This was the 

first time since 1992 that funding did not increase substantially. It is imperative 

that donors reaffirm their commitment to eradicate antipersonnel mines with renewed 

multiyear funding pledges.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&middot; At current levels 

of funding and demining, many of the mine-affected States Parties will not meet 

the ten-year deadline to complete mine clearance. Funding for mine victim assistance 

programs has been woefully inadequate.</font></p>
