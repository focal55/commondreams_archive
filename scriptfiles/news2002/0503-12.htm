<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SANTA CRUZ, CA 

- May 3 -  The vigil for peace in Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq and Israel was disrupted for over ten minutes last Friday by two large-framed men shouting their identity as Marines and accusing participants of being unpatriotic. The 5:00 PM vigil has been a regular weekly event since the bombing of Afghanistan began in October of 2001.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Friday, April 26th, 2002 at approximately 6:00 PM, a vehicle pulled into the gas station on the corner, behind where most of the participants usually gather to display their signs and placards. Two large individuals exited the vehicle and came towards the group of demonstrators in an aggressive manner. With loud voices, they exclaimed, &quot;We're the Marines!&quot;, &quot;Take those signs down!&quot;, &quot;You're the terrorists!&quot; and &quot;Traitors!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vigils are attended by a diversity of people, ranging from seniors to children. The 10-12 vigil participants present maintained their commitment to nonviolence and responded only with words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;Marines&quot; proceeded to kick over signs that were mounted on sticks and placed in the grass. The two individuals then physically assaulted at least 

two

of the men present, pushing one out of the way and grabbing another one by his shirt. While attempting to take a participant's sign, the mounting 

stick was

broken in half.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two female attendees confronted these aggressive individuals, suggesting, among other things, that they study the history of US foreign policy more thoroughly before aggressively defending it. Their response was to cease further physical assaults and engage instead in verbal abuse. After about ten minutes they apparently became aware of an attendee in close proximity using a telephone and responded by returning to their vehicle and driving 

away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Demonstrators, the people in nearby automobiles, and patrons at the gas station, witnessed the episode. The vehicle license plate was provided to the Santa Cruz Police Department's dispatch operator by telephone during the event. While participants during previous weeks have typically noticed patrol vehicles passing through the intersection every few minutes, there was no evidence that an officer was dispatched to the scene in response to the emergency call. The participants declined to wait for an officer beyond 30 minutes after the incident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Santa Cruz Peace Coalition condemns the behavior of these individuals and calls on all citizens who value free speech to stand in solidarity with us. We will not be deterred by violence or threats of violence and ask that you join us this Friday and every Friday from 5-6pm at the intersection of Ocean and Water to help us maintain an area for peaceful dissent.</font></p>
