YORK - July 25 - Responding to President Bush's speech today in North Carolina, 

the Center for Justice &amp; Democracy today called on Bush to stop playing politics 

with rising medical insurance costs and focus on the real reasons why consumers 

are paying more and more every day for insurance -- the weak economy and corporate 

irresponsibility by the insurance industry. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Insurance companies, whose own questionable business and accounting 

practices have made insurance unaffordable for many health care professionals, 

are blaming others for their own mismanagement,&#8221; said Joanne Doroshow, Executive 

Director of the Center for Justice &amp; Democracy. &#8220;Rather than trying 

to reign in this rogue, profiteering industry, President Bush has decided to focus 

on limiting patients&#8217; rights to hold hospitals and HMOs accountable in court. 

The only result will be to increase medical malpractice and make insurance companies 

richer than they already are. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;President Bush should be calling for measures to stop price-gouging 

by insurance companies. He should be insisting that the government impose a new 

regime of corporate responsibility and accountability on the insurance industry, 

whose business practices are wreaking havoc on the American economy.&#8221; </font></p>
