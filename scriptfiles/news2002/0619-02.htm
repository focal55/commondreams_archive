<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 19 - Free 
TV and radio air time for congressional candidates would significantly strengthen 
our democracy. Candidates wishing to represent the interests of the great majority 
of our people, and not be beholden to corporate PACs, would find it feasible to 
run for office. Challengers, who lack officeholders&#8217; power to extract campaign 
cash from wealthy special interests, would have the capacity to communicate their 
ideas to voters.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Free air time would give the public wider choices. It&#8217;s just not healthy 
for American democracy that in the last election we had an incumbent re-election 
rate of 98 percent in the House and 80 percent in the Senate.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen has long supported free air time as an ingredient of comprehensive 
campaign finance reform that would include voluntary spending limits and public 
financing. Since public financing of congressional elections is not imminent, 
Congress should quickly pass free air time legislation to make congressional races 
more competitive and reduce candidate dependence on special interest money.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The biggest obstacle to this sensible reform is the broadcast lobby. The tens 
of millions that broadcasters spend to curry favor with politicians and lobby 
Congress have placed them in a privileged position. But it&#8217;s time for them 
to be required to meet their public service obligations by allocating a small 
fraction of time on the public airwaves to facilitate competitive elections. After 
all, that&#8217;s what happens in virtually every other industrial democracy in 
the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We plan to work with Congress and the many citizens&#8217; groups that are 
part of this coalition to fashion the strongest possible legislative proposal 
and mobilize the public behind it.</font></p>
