- June 27 - A new WRI report released today urges that the way electricity sectors 
are being restructured throughout the world should be changed. Otherwise, social 
benefits and environmental considerations could be easily discounted as rich and 
poor countries focus on making their power markets more competitive. </p> </font>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Electricity reforms need to be changed if social and environmental benefits 
are not to be swept aside in the global rush toward a market-driven vision of 
the electric power sector," said Dr. Navroz Dubash, lead author of the new study, 
<b>Power Politics: Equity and environment in electricity reform</b>. "If appropriately 
done, electricity reform is an opportunity to re-direct billions of dollars toward 
a sustainable and equitable energy future."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Currently less than half the people living in rural areas have access to electricity. 
Generating electricity accounts for 38 percent of the global carbon dioxide emissions, 
thus driving global climate change. It also contributes significantly to local 
and regional pollution.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The report examines the electricity sector restructuring in six countries: 
Argentina, Bulgaria, Ghana, India, Indonesia, and South Africa. In these countries, 
profit alone did not provide enough incentive to reach rural customers and the 
urban poor. The reforms, often targeted at reducing subsidies and increasing tariffs, 
have also triggered social hardships and political opposition. </font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Decisions made now about how these reforms are conducted will shape development 
patterns for decades to come. They need not follow a single prescription," said 
Agus Sari, director of the Indonesian think-tank Pelangi and a contributor to 
the report. "Electricity sector restructuring should support, rather than hinder 
sustainable development throughout the world."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The report cites a World Bank study stating that by 1998, 33 percent of developing 
countries had passed new electricity laws, 29 percent had established an independent 
regulator, and 40 percent had allowed the entry of privately owned power producers.</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The World Bank and other donor agencies could do more to ensure that the 
environmental implications of restructuring are considered, and that domestic 
environmental constituencies have a seat at the table," said Frances Seymour, 
director of WRI’s Institutions and Governance Program and a contributor to the 
report. "Their modest efforts in this direction have been constrained by past 
reputation and a perception that they favor private interests."</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The report finds that electricity reforms were overwhelmingly driven by narrow 
financial considerations. In order to change the current reform process for the 
electricity sector, the authors recommend the following:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Frame reforms to accommodate social and environmental benefits</b>. A narrow 
focus on financial concerns is too restrictive. Donors such as the World Bank 
must allow a nationally-driven vision of reform to emerge.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Structure finance around reform goals, rather than reform goals around 
finance</b>. Reform processes have catered to a need to attract private capital, 
but a broader vision and public support could reduce the risks to investors.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Support reform processes with a system of sound governance</b>. An open, 
transparent process of reform will make for more politically sustainable results. 
</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Build political strategies to support attention to a public benefits agenda</b>. 
Linking the social and the environmental agendas will be a more useful political 
approach to reform.</font></li>
</ul>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Electricity restructuring is an example of how financial globalization has 
fueled development paths based on narrow economic considerations," said Dr. Dubash. 
"The public interest depends on whether policy-makers are sufficiently far-sighted 
to steer globalization toward positive social and environmental outcomes."</font></p>
