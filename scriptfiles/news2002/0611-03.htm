<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - June 11 - Just days before the 30th anniversary of Title IX, the federal 

law that bars sex discrimination in education, an investigation by 

the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) will reveal that female 

athletes are still not getting a fair share of athletic 

scholarships. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a first step in a campaign to remedy these persistent 

inequities, NWLC will send demand letters to colleges and 

universities that have severe scholarship gaps between the number 

of female athletes and the scholarship dollars they receive. NWLC 

will warn each college and university of their possible Title IX 

violation and insist that they cure this unfair and harmful 

practice before additional legal action is taken.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Female athletes on average receive much less in athletic 

scholarships than male athletes. This has a huge impact on the 

lives of young women, and may prevent potential recruits from ever 

getting a higher education. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Title IX requires the percentages of total athletic scholarship 

dollars awarded to male and female athletes to be within one 

percent of their total athletic participation rates. For example, 

if 40 percent of a school's athletes are women, then female 

athletes should get between 39 and 41 percent of the total athletic 

scholarship money awarded by the school. </font></p>
