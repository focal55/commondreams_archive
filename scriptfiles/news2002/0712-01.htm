- July 12 - Judge Emmet Sullivan yesterday issued his written opinion allowing 
the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch to proceed with their suits challenging the 
Bush Administration's attempts to keep Cheney Task Force meetings with energy 
industry executives secret. In the opinion, Judge Sullivan wrote that Vice President 
Cheney and his co-defendants were seeking a ruling from him that &quot;would eviscerate 
the understanding of checks and balances between the three branches of government 
on which our constitutional order depends.&quot;</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Judge chastised the Justice Department 
lawyers for attempting to mislead the court, writing:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;the fact that the government 
has stubbornly refused to acknowledge the existing controlling law in at least 
two cases, does not strike this Court as a coincidence. One or two isolated mis-citations 
or misleading interpretations of precedent are forgivable mistakes of busy counsel, 
but a consistent pattern of misconstruing precedent presents a much more serious 
concern.&quot; (p.64, footnote 14)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May, Vice President Cheney and 
other Administration Officials were rebuffed by Judge Sullivan, who ruled from 
the bench against their motions to dismiss the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch 
lawsuits. The Federal court today issued the Judge's written order and opinion 
setting forth the reasons for his ruling.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club suit asserts that 
by refusing to tell the public about the influence energy industries had in crafting 
national energy policy, the Cheney Task Force violated the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act (FACA). The Sierra Club is asking the court to require Vice President Cheney 
and other defendants to disclose to the American people what went on behind closed 
doors in the creation of the national energy policy. The suit has been consolidated 
with a similar suit filed by Judicial Watch. The Federal District Court ruled 
today against the Administration's motions to dismiss both lawsuits.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Judge's strong words for 
the government clearly show that attempts to hoodwink the American public will 
not be tolerated,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. 
&quot;Americans deserve to know what happened behind those closed doors when the 
energy industry met with Administration officials, and the law requires letting 
the light shine into that darkened room.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club filed this lawsuit 
after the Bush Administration refused to divulge how much influence big energy 
companies like Enron and oil and coal producers had in crafting the nation's energy 
policy, despite numerous requests from Congress and others.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At a time when people are concerned 
about corporate responsibility, and the Administration's ties to business, it's 
vital that Americans know how much influence polluting industry executives had 
over our national energy plan,&quot; continued Pope.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The energy policy that ultimately 
came out of the Administration relies on technologies that will pollute our air 
and water, destroy special places and fail to reduce our dependence on oil and 
coal. At the very least, the American people deserve an explanation of why the 
Administration chose this path rather than safer and cleaner technologies that 
would protect the environment and save consumers money at the same time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge Sullivan's ruling today also 
set forth a schedule for allowing the Sierra Club and Judicial Watch to proceed 
with discovery, the legal process where they will be allowed to review details 
about the participation of energy executives in the activities of the Cheney Energy 
Task Force. The Sierra Club and Judicial Watch are to submit their proposals for 
discovery by Friday, July 19.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sierra Club is asking for a full 
accounting of what happened behind the closed doors of the Cheney Energy Task 
Force, including: who was in the room; what proposals did the energy industry 
executives and lobbyists make; what documents did the energy industry submit; 
and what Task Force documents did they review.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A .pdf file of the ruling is available 
by calling 202-675-6698.</font></p>
