<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - July 4 - For the first 
time since the US began bombing Afghanistan last October, Afghan-American organizations 
have called for a protest against the killing of innocent civilians by the US 
military. Women for Afghan Women and Young Afghan World Alliance join by other 
peace groups will be picketing outside the White House at noon on Friday, July 
5, 2001. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This past Monday, July 1, U.S. air 
attack killed and injured scores of civilians as they were attending a wedding 
celebration. Yesterday a Pentagon official dismissed the importance of keeping 
track of numbers of Afghan casualties. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today in Kabul, 200 protesters about 
half of them women in burqas, blocked midmorning traffic. Compensation was one 
of the demands. &quot;We cannot tolerate more innocent victims in our country 
and American bombardment of civilian targets,&quot; said Theyba one of the protest 
organizers in Afghanistan. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Washington, DC protest organizer, 
Masuda Sultan, Vice President of Women for Afghan Women is a young Afghan-American 
woman who is &quot;angry that civilian casualties continue to happen, even accidentally,&quot; 
at the hands of the US military. She lost 19 extended family members when a farm 
near Kandahar was hit (possibly by the same AC-130 gunships that hit Monday's 
Afghan wedding party) during a US strike last October. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Masuda was initially cautiously supportive 
U.S. intervention but is now disappointed that she has yet to hear an explanation 
or an apology directly from the Pentagon regarding her family's deaths.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier this year Masuda Sultan met 
September 11 victim's families who visited Afghanistan as members of Peaceful 
Tomorrows. Upon their return Masuda joined them to lobby congress to provide compensation 
funds for civilian Afghan victims of US military actions. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US military has been bombing 
Afghanistan since October of last year. Yet there is no official acknowledgment 
that innocent Afghan civilians have been killed or maimed in this &quot;precision 
bombing&quot; campaign. While the number of civilian casualties is unclear, estimates 
range from 1,000 to 4,000 people. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The victims of the 9-11 tragedy have 
rightfully received a tremendous outpouring of compassion from the world community 
and help from the US government and humanitarian agencies to ease their burdens. 
Said Sultan &quot;But what about the innocent victims in Afghanistan who lost 
their lives during the US air strikes?&quot;</font></p>
