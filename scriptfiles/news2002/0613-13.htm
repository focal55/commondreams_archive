- June 13 - Physicians for Social Responsibility deplores the demise today of 
a main cornerstone of international arms control that has brokered security between 
the U.S. and Russia for over thirty years. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The ABM Treaty has been, and continues to be, essential to the prevention 
of nuclear war and the elimination of nuclear weapons in the United States, Russia, 
and around the world,&quot; said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H., executive director 
and CEO of Physicians for Social Responsibility. &quot;The end of this treaty 
marks a historic turning point away from proven arms control regimes that have 
successfully ensured American security for decades towards a future which will 
be destabilizing and vastly less secure.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ABM Treaty expires today, six months after President Bush announced his 
intentions to withdraw from the treaty. Bush's announcement came without Congressional 
approval and several members of the House of Representatives have filed a lawsuit 
to prevent the President from withdrawing from the treaty. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ABM Treaty, which was intended to stop the United States and the Soviet 
Union -- and now Russia -- from deploying national missile defenses, is considered 
an obstacle to the Bush administration's multi-layered missile defense efforts. 
Preliminary construction on a missile defense installation at Fort Greely, in 
Alaska, is set to begin June 14, 2002. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The ultimate irony is that the Bush administration decision to withdraw 
from this treaty is prompted by a dream to pursue a National Missile Defense system 
to make America more secure. Yet development of such a system will only further 
exacerbate the destabilization caused by the end of the ABM Treaty, worsen relations 
with Russia and China, and make America less secure. It is a Catch-22 of the worst 
kind.&quot; </font></p>
