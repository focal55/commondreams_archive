<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  

- May 3 - The Sierra Club today condemned the Bush Administration

for allowing polluting mining companies to dump their waste into America's

rivers and streams. The millions of tons of mining waste that will now be

allowed in America's waterways will bury streams, kill all types of stream

life, and pollute drinking water. The rule announced by the EPA today could

have far-reaching impacts on the safety of rivers, streams and wetlands

across the entire country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's decision is as irresponsible as it gets,&quot; said Carl Pope,

Executive Director of the Sierra Club. &quot;Not only are polluting mining

companies allowed to blow the tops off mountains, but they can then bury

America's rivers and streams with their waste. The Bush Administration is

choosing the mining industry over water for drinking, recreation, and

wildlife.  These streams, and the communities they flow through, will never

recover from the Bush Administration's decision.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Blasting off the tops of mountains to reach coal seams is widespread in

West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia.  In West Virginia alone, this mining

is burying more than 1,000 miles of streams.</font></p>

<p></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

The Bush Administration's rule announced today could legitimize mountaintop

removal and not only further degrade the environment and public health in

mining regions, but also lead to the degradation of rivers, streams and

wetlands across the nation from other sources of pollution like hardrock

mining waste and construction debris.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Courts have ruled in the past that the Army Corps of Engineers cannot issue

permits to authorize mountaintop removal because of the mining waste that

ends up in streams, rivers and wetlands. Since 1977, the Clean Water Act

has prohibited using waste materials as &quot;fill.&quot;  The Administration's new

rule allows industries to fill wetlands, rivers and streams with mining and

other wastes with a permit from the Corps.  Millions of tons of coal waste,

hardrock mining waste and other types of harmful wastes could be dumped

legally into our streams, rivers, lakes and wetlands.</font></p>

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Americans won't be fooled into believing their rivers aren't being

polluted simply by calling it 'fill' instead of 'waste,&quot; continued Pope.

&quot;This is pollution that will have devastating impacts on drinking water and

wildlife across the country.&quot;</font></p>
