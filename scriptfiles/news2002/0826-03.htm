<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 26 - The lead 

headline in this morning's <i>Washington Post</i> is: "Bush Aides Say Iraq War 

Needs No Hill Vote." In contrast, Wayne Morse -- one of only two Senators who 

voted against the Gulf of Tonkin resolution used by the Johnson administration 

to escalate the Vietnam War -- argued that declaring war is the responsibility 

of Congress. Audio of his 1964 statements is available:</font></p>

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Morse:</I> "No war has been declared 

in Southeast Asia and until a war is declared it is my position that it is unconstitutional 

to send American boys to their death in South Vietnam or anywhere else in Southeast 

Asia... I don't know why we think, just because we're mighty, that we have the 

right to try to substitute might for right. And that's the American policy in 

Southeast Asia -- it's just as unsound when we do it as when Russia does it."

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Morse:</I> "Since when do we have 

to back our president -- or should we -- when the president is proposing an unconstitutional 

act?" <i>Audio at: <a href="http://www.radioproject.org/sound/Morse2.mp3" target="_new">

<P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Reporter:</I> "Senator, the Constitution 

gives to the president of the United States the sole responsibility for the conduct 

of foreign policy."<br>

<I>Morse:</I> "Couldn't be more wrong. You couldn't make a more unsound legal 

statement than the one you have just made. This is the promulgation of an old 

fallacy that foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States -- that's 

nonsense -- it belongs to the American people, and the Constitution of our fathers 

has made that very, very clear..."<br>

<I>Reporter:</I> "You know that the American people cannot formulate and execute 

foreign policy."<br>

<I>Morse:</I> "Why do you say that? Why, you're a man of little faith in democracy 

if you make that kind of an -- I have complete faith in the ability of the American 

people to follow the facts if you'll give them. And my charge against my government 

is we're not giving the American people the facts." <i>Audio: <a href="http://www.radioproject.org/sound/Morse3.mp3" target="_new">

Author of <i>Soul of a Citizen: Living With Conviction in a Cynical Time</i> and 

<i>Hope in Hard Times: America's Peace Movement and the Reagan Era</i>, Loeb said 

today: "As during the Vietnam War, we're being asked to accept whatever the president 

does as wise and justified. By ceding our right to have a full national debate 

over whether we should go to war with Iraq, we're setting the stage for similarly 

damaging potential consequences..."</p> </font>

Executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, Solomon recently wrote 

a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article headlined: "Where Is the Voice of Dissent? 

As we weigh an attack on Iraq, we need someone like the Vietnam era's Wayne Morse." 

He said today: "Transfixed with tactical issues, none of the senators on television 

in recent days would dream of acknowledging the present relevance of a statement 

made by Senator [Wayne] Morse a third of a century ago: 'We're going to become 

guilty, in my judgment, of being the greatest threat to the peace of the world. 

It's an ugly reality, and we Americans don't like to face up to it.'"</p> </i></p>
