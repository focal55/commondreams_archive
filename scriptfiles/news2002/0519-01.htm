- May 19 -  Local chapters of East Timor Action Network (ETAN) are celebrating 

hard won freedom of East Timor, the first new nation of the 21st century. 

At midnight on May 20, East Timor's flag will be raised over Dili, East 

Timor's capital, to mark the new nation's independence.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Words can't express our joy at East Timor's independence,&quot; said John M. 

Miller, spokesperson for ETAN. &quot;We are proud and to have supported the East 

Timorese people in their struggle for freedom.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Local ETAN activities are planned in 18 cities in 13 states, including 

Berkeley, CA; Bloomington, IN; Green Bay, WI; Madison, WI; Minneapolis, MN; 

New York City; Philadelphia, PA; Portland, OR; Stony Brook, NY; Tempe, AZ; 

and Washington, DC. A full schedule of events can be found at 

<a href="http://etan.org/news/calendar.htm" target="_new">http://etan.org/news/calendar.htm</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the city councils of Madison, Berkeley and San Francisco will 

consider resolutions congratulating the new nation and its people next week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both houses of the U.S. Congress are also considering resolutions strongly 

supporting the new nation. The resolutions are sponsored by Lincoln Chafee 

(R-RI) and Russell Feingold (D-WI) in the Senate (S.Con.Res 109) and Chris 

Smith (R-NJ), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Patrick Kennedy (D-RI) and Frank Wolf 

(R-VA) in the House of Representatives.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We applaud your achievement, won after great hardship and against 

overwhelming odds. Your victory against occupation by the fourth largest 

country backed by the world's most powerful nation gives hope and 

inspiration to all who work for genuine democracy, human rights and 

self-determination,&quot; ETAN said in an independence day statement to the East 

Timorese people. The network pledged continued support for the new nation. 

The full statement can be found at 

<a href="http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/05congrats.htm" target="_new">http://www.etan.org/news/2002a/05congrats.htm</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In its statement, ETAN dedicated itself to achieving justice for past 

crimes, the return of all refugees currently in Indonesia who wish to do 

so, adequate levels of assistance to the new nation; and continued 

restrictions on U.S. support for the Indonesian military &quot;so that others 

will not experience abuses at the hands of the military from which [East 

Timor is] now free.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ETAN also said it &quot;will continue to seek an accurate accounting of our own 

government's role in supporting Indonesia's invasion and occupation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1975, when Indonesia illegally invaded East Timor 90% of the weapons 

used came from the U.S. One-third of the population  more than 200,000 

people - were killed. In 1999, the East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for 

independence in a UN-organized referendum. The Indonesian military then ransacked the country, agreeing to withdraw after the U.S. cut off all military assistance and other aid.  East Timor's independence follows two and a half years of UN administration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For over a decade, the East Timor Action Network/U.S. (ETAN) has supported 

self-determination and human rights for East Timor. It continues to work in 

support human dignity for the people of East Timor by advocating for 

democracy, sustainable development, social, legal, and economic justice and 

human rights, including women's rights.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Members of ETAN in the U.S. as well as in East Timor are available for interviews. (Call 718-596-7668.)</font></p>
