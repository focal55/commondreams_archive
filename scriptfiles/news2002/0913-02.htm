SYRIA - September 13 - Preparing to depart Damascus on his trip to Baghdad, U.S. 

Rep. Nick Rahall (D-WV) said the U.S. Department of State has approved his travel 

under the National Interest category.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a telephone interview today, Rahall 

said:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I was happy to see the President 

call for support of UN resolutions. The UN cannot become a relic of the past. 

It must be more active, and it must strive harder to help resolve the current 

stalemate between Iraq and the US. But the President, unfortunately, continues 

to ratchet up the war rhetoric.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I think we need to calm down 

this rhetoric, pursue peaceful means. We don't need the rhetoric of the people 

who put words into the president's speech - bellicose rhetoric written by the 

same people who were there twelve years ago during the Gulf War when Bush the 

first was President. I did support Bush the first using force to drive Iraq from 

Kuwait. But this is vastly different today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We may have won the battle 

in the Persian Gulf, but we didn't win the war. We have not won the war against 

the real enemy - Al Qaeda. Bush has built a great coalition to fight our true 

enemy, Al Qaeda, but an attack on Iraq will not help maintain that support. We 

must fight the true terrorists, especially where the evidence is clearly there. 

These partners in our coalition will find themselves in an uneasy position if 

we force them to support military action in Iraq.&quot;</font></p>
