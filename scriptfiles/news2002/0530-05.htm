<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 30 - A letter sent this week by 

U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Ralph F. Boyd, Jr. 

to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy reveals that 

the Justice Department continues to fail in its obligation to 

protect the rights of American voters, said People For the American 

Way Foundation President Ralph G. Neas today. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It was an outrage that thousands of Florida voters were 

prevented from having their votes counted,&quot; said Neas. &quot;And it is 

an outrage for the Justice Department to reinvent history by 

pretending that there were no serious problems in Florida in 

November 2000 except for language assistance issues in three 

counties. What was supposed to be an effort to protect the rights 

of voters has become a political effort to protect the president 

and Florida Governor Jeb Bush from questions about the election 

outcome. Unfortunately, it is part of a pattern by Attorney General 

John Ashcroft to retreat from enforcement of Federal civil rights 

law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas said that Boyd's blanket assertion in the May 28th letter 

that &quot;very few voters&quot; were actually denied the right to vote in 

Florida flies in the face of publicly available information that is 

documented in the voting rights lawsuit filed by a coalition of 

civil rights organizations in January 2001. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas criticized Boyd for making no reference to state election 

officials who oversaw an effort that improperly stripped thousands 

of voters from the voting rolls. It is a matter of public record 

that these state officials hired a company to create lists of 

voters accused of being felons so they could be purged from voter 

rolls. These officials urged the company to use overly broad and 

improper criteria to accomplish this task. Most voters removed from 

the rolls had no recourse on Election Day. The impact of this 

illegal purge fell disproportionately on African-American voters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neas said that Boyd's assertion that the Civil Rights Division &quot;found no credible evidence in our investigations that Floridians 

were intentionally denied their right to vote during the November 

2000 election&quot; lays the groundwork for undermining the Voting 

Rights Act, which is designed to protect against actions that have 

a discriminatory impact on voters, regardless of whether such 

intent can be proven. This is all too consistent with previous 

actions by John Ashcroft's Justice Department to abandon the 

general principle that discrimination -- whether intentional or not 

-- is a violation of federal civil rights law. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Justice Department has failed those whose right to vote was 

denied in 2000,&quot; said Neas. &quot;Now it's up to the courts.&quot; Neas said 

that the voting rights case filed by a broad coalition of civil 

rights organizations in January 2001 was moving forward with a 

trial scheduled in August. </font></p>
