- June 13 - After 23 years of advocacy by women&#8217;s rights organizations and 
just in time for the November elections, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
has scheduled a hearing to discuss the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). &quot;This is a critically 
important vote for women. The Feminist Majority has spent the past five years 
fighting to end the oppression of women in Afghanistan. We must ratify this historic 
treaty so that we don&#8217;t let down the women of the world, especially in places 
like Afghanistan,&quot; said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority. 
&quot;Domestically, this treaty provides a way for every Senator to say no to 
regimes that oppress women.&quot;</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For years, anti-women&#8217;s rights Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC), former chair 
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blocked CEDAW from having its day in 
the US Senate. Today, the committee&#8217;s current chair Sen. Joseph Biden (D-DE), 
working with women&#8217;s groups, is bringing the international treaty before 
the Senate. In recognition of the historic nature of the hearing, Biden will hand 
the gavel over to the committee&#8217;s sole female member, Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-CA) &#8211; who will chair the CEDAW hearing. &quot;I hope that there is neither 
a gender gap nor a party gap in CEDAW,&quot; Smeal said. &quot;But if there is 
a party gap, CEDAW could move the gender gap to the forefront of the Senate elections 
in November.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1979, the United Nations created CEDAW, an international treaty that defines 
discrimination and gives states a plan of action to ensure that the rights of 
women are equal to men. So far, 169 countries &#8211; or two-thirds of the United 
Nations membership &#8211; have ratified CEDAW, pledging to give women equal rights 
in all aspects of their lives including political, health, educational, social 
and legal. The United States is not one of those 169 countries. The United States 
is among the 22 countries that have yet to ratify the treaty - keeping company 
with such notorious women&#8217;s rights abusers as the Taliban&#8217;s Afghanistan, 
Monaco and Sudan. In addition, the United States is the only industrialized nation 
whose government has not ratified this treaty. The ratification of CEDAW could 
represent a long overdue commitment by the United States to protect women from 
discrimination. &quot;If we fail to ratify CEDAW, it would be national disgrace,&quot; 
Smeal said. &quot;The United States loses credibility on women&#8217;s rights 
and human rights worldwide until it ratifies this treaty.&quot;</font></p>
