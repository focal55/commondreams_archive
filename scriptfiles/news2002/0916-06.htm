- September 16 - President Bush today 

addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations, and laid 

out his case for war against Iraq. The President stressed that 

for ten years Saddam Hussein has led Iraq in defying UN Security 

Council resolutions and has tried at every turn to cheat weapons 

inspectors attempting to carry out the Security Council mandate 

to disarm Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War. Physicians for 

Social Responsibility, a leading disarmament group that shares 

a Nobel Prize with the International Physicians for the 

Prevention of Nuclear War, after assessing the President's 

speech, announced it opposes US plans to invade Iraq. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President stated Iraq's possession of Weapons of Mass 

Destruction (WMD) is a serious threat, and the international 

community must act to force him to comply with the UN 

inspections regime. If Saddam Hussein fails to do so, an 

overthrow of the Iraqi regime will follow. The President, in his 

speech, and in a report issued today by the White House offered 

no evidence, however, of new activities by Iraq in the WMD 

field, and no evidence that Iraq poses an immediate threat to 

its neighbors or the United States. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The President has still failed to answer the questions, why 

war? And why now?&quot; said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H., 

Executive Director and CEO of PSR. &quot;We can all agree that Iraq 

must comply with the UN Security Council resolutions calling for 

its disarmament, and that greater efforts are needed to enforce 

these resolutions. But the President seems intent on marching 

blindly off to war, ignoring the concerns in the international 

community, his own party and the country as a whole.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is far from clear that international law permits military 

action without provocation or imminent, immediate threat of 

attack from Iraq. The minimum pre-requisite would be a 

resolution from the United Nations Security Council calling for 

military action. The US Congress should also vote a War Powers 

resolution if our armed forces are to be asked to fight. 

Nevertheless, the mere possession of WMD by a state has never 

been seen as a casus belli. The possession of nuclear weapons by 

the United States, and its refusal to act on its legal 

obligation to disarm under Article VI of the NPT seriously 

undermine the President's case for invasion of Iraq on the 

suspicion of WMD possession. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;If the US wishes to establish a serious international norm 

against the possession of WMD that would be fantastic news,&quot; 

said Martin Butcher, Director of Security Programs for PSR. &quot;In 

that context, the disarmament of Iraq must happen alongside 

serious efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons from the arsenals 

of world's nuclear powers, and with strong enforcement of the 

conventions banning chemical and biological weapons. These are 

policies that, until now, the administration has vehemently 

opposed.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to PSR, US policy toward Iraq has been inconsistent 

and caused much humanitarian suffering. A US attack would only 

add to the existing threats to human health and the environment. 

Most troublesome is the possibility that the United States would 

use nuclear weapons in an attack on Iraqi WMD sites. US 

Counterproliferation policy calls for early use of nuclear 

weapons in any conflict to destroy Chemical and Biological 

Weapons sites, as well as bunkers that may contain such weapons 

or facilities to produce them. This policy aims to preempt the 

use of WMD by another country and is at the core of the Nuclear 

Posture Review. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Bush administration's Nuclear Posture Review sought to 

reshape the nuclear arsenal as a force intended primarily for 

war-fighting,&quot; said Musil. &quot;Now the President is pursuing a 

collision course with Iraq that could put the NPR into practice 

and see nuclear weapons used for the first time since 1945. This 

is unacceptable under any circumstances.&quot; </font></p>
