- September 4 - Despite some advances made by negotiators at the World Summit 

on Sustainable Development (WSSD), which ends today, the World Resources Institute 

(WRI) expressed disappointment in the overall outcomes incorporated in the WSSD 

Plan of Action. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Over-all we must ask, will the poor be better off ten years from now? 

Will our world be safer or more secure from global environmental threats ten years 

from now?&quot; said Jonathan Lash, WRI president. &quot;Unfortunately, there 

are too many gaps and too few teeth in the WSSD Plan of Action.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The WRI delegation was particularly disappointed over the governments&#8217; 

failure to set targets for increases in renewable energy like solar or wind. The 

United States and other oil producing countries have resisted setting targets 

for renewable energy, while European countries and some developing countries like 

Brazil and the Philippines lobbied hard for such targets. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Plan of Action contains language on actions to help solve climate 

change, it is silent on the need for all countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. 

This treaty is needed to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on 

Climate Change which was adopted by the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The 

United States has lobbied hard against it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Energy and climate change are inextricably linked. Energy generated by 

fossil fuels is driving global climate change,&quot; said Jonathan Lash. &quot;We 

have missed an opportunity to increase energy production from non-polluting sources 

like solar, biomass, and wind, and to provide the many companies taking action 

to reduce emissions with a secure framework for their actions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The head of WRI&#8217;s WSSD delegation, Dr. Tony La Vi&ntilde;a, also criticized 

the lack of commitment to provide more financial resources to implement this plan. 

He also criticized the governments&#8217; failure to guide the World Trade Organization 

in implementing the Doha Agreement and to look at globalization from a sustainable 

development perspective.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While expressing disappointment over these issues, WRI welcomed many of the 

targets adopted by the WSSD, especially on water, sanitation, and biodiversity. 

The WSSD Plan of Action calls for halving the number of people without access 

to proper sanitation by 2015; restoring depleted fish stocks by 2015; and significantly 

reducing the extinction rate of the world&#8217;s plants and animals by 2010. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While far from perfect, the WSSD Plan of Action brings us forward in 

some issues,&quot; said Dr. La Vi&ntilde;a. &quot;The problem is that small steps 

are no longer sufficient when the world is faced with enormous environmental and 

development problems.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The WRI delegation also welcomed the WSSD&#8217;s reaffirmation of Principle 

10 and its support for the Partnership for Principle 10 (PP10). This principle 

was first enshrined in the 1992 Earth Summit Declaration and calls for public 

access to information, participation, and justice to ensure environmentally sustainable 

decisions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The WRI delegation stressed that solutions to global environmental problems 

can be more effectively addressed through collaborations like PP10, rather than 

leaving them entirely to governments. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This Summit will be 

remembered not for the treaties, the commitments, or the declarations it produced, 

but for the first stirrings of a new way of governing the global commons -- the 

beginnings of a shift from the stiff formal waltz of traditional diplomacy to 

the jazzier dance of improvisational solution-oriented partnerships that may include 

non-government organizations, willing governments and other stakeholders,&quot; 

said Lash. </font></p>
