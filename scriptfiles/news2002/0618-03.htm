<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 18 - With 
giant replicas of radioactive waste transportation casks as a backdrop, national 
environmental, public interest and consumer groups joined lawmakers and activists 
at a press conference and rally today to urge the Senate to reject the dangerous 
proposal to transport high-level nuclear waste to a dump at Yucca Mountain in 
Nevada. A final vote in the Senate is expected within the next month.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The caravan of six casks converged at the Capitol today after a three-week 
national tour designed to alert citizens who live near the projected nuclear waste 
transportation routes. Each dumbbell-shaped cask is 20 feet long and seven feet 
tall, a life-size replica of the actual casks that would be traveling on the nation's 
highways, railways and waterways for up to 38 years if the Yucca Mountain project 
is approved.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have been overwhelmed by the response of local communities as we've 
driven through town after town in the last few weeks,&quot; said Amy Shollenberger, 
a Vermont activist who drove one of the casks through New England and the Midwest. 
&quot;We&#8217;ve come to Washington to deliver the message that people across 
the country are worried about the prospect of regular shipments of deadly nuclear 
waste through their communities.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The potential dangers of this scheme are enormous, opponents said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Department of Energy&#8217;s Yucca Mountain recommendation fails 
to address transportation concerns,&quot; said Joan Claybrook, Public Citizen 
president. &quot;Shipping tens of thousands of tons of nuclear waste in untested 
casks to a questionable site, as currently proposed, poses risks that cannot be 
justified. An accident, crash or attack involving just one of these shipments 
could be catastrophic.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Accidents involving nuclear waste transport already have occurred. A 1996 analysis 
of Department of Energy accident reports documented 72 &quot;incidents&quot; since 
1949 involving nuclear waste shipments, including four instances of &quot;accidental 
radioactive material contamination beyond the vehicle&quot; and 49 instances in 
which the surface of the container was contaminated. With Yucca Mountain, the 
number of nuclear waste shipments would be vastly increased. Since the beginning 
of the nuclear age, there have been 3,000 shipments of high-level waste; that 
number could be exceeded within the first two years of shipments to Yucca Mountain.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the press conference, activists unveiled a statement endorsed by more than 
200 citizens groups from around the country opposing the Yucca Mountain Project.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are extremely concerned that these mobile Chernobyls &#8211; more 
than 100 thousand shipments of waste &#8211; will move across the United States 
for four decades, past our homes and past our children&#8217;s schools,&quot; 
said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Leaders of national environmental and public interest organizations emphasized 
the dangers of transporting high-level nuclear waste and problems with the Yucca 
Mountain site itself, calling last Friday&#8217;s earthquake in southern Nevada 
&quot;a wake-up call from Mother Nature.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S. Sens. Harry Reid, assistant majority leader from Nevada, and John Ensign 
(R-Nev.) spoke at today&#8217;s event. Other participants included representatives 
of the Alliance for Nuclear Accountability, Clean Water Action, Friends of the 
Earth, League of Women Voters, National Environmental Trust, Nuclear Information 
Resource Service, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, Safe Energy 
Communication Council, Sierra Club, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and Women's 
Action for New Directions.</font></p>
