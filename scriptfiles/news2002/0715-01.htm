- July 15 - In the midst of a global ecological crisis that the Bush Administration's 
own studies have confirmed, the President continues to enact corporate-friendly 
policies and legislation that aggravate the damage, threaten public health, and 
compromise national security, charge Greens.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We Americans place the greatest burden on the
environment, through CO2 emissions and
overconsumption,&quot; said Margaret Lewis, Congressional
candidate in NY State's new 20th Congressional
District. &quot;It takes 12.2 hectares of land to support
each American citizen, while it takes just half a
hectare to support someone in Burundi. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The doubling of human consumption by the developed
world in the last three decades, with a growth rate of
1.5% a year, has contributed to both the decimation of
the earth's resources and systems as well as the
impoverishment of less developed countries and a
growing gap between rich and poor within the US,&quot;
added Lorna Salzman, Green candidate for Congress in
New York's 1st Congressional District and a longtime environmental activist on 
Long Island. &quot;We have total subservience [in Congress and the White House] 
to corporate interests and to unsustainable levels of consumption. Unless we change 
direction drastically within the next decade, the entire fabric of the earth's 
ecosystems -- including fisheries, forests, and freshwater -- will be shredded.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of the Green Party of the United States are
promoting positive US participation in the Earth
Summit, set to take place August 26 to September 4 in Johannesburg, South Africa. 
But Greens despair that the interests of the American people will be betrayed 
by the bullying anti-environmental stance of a delegation sent by the Bush White 
House.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greens cite a litany of destructive Bush policies and
sell-outs to corporate lobbies:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL: On July 9, the Senate voted
60 to 39 to override Nevada's objection to the Yucca
Mountain nuclear waste dump, demonstrating the
influence of the nuclear lobby over both Democrats and Republicans. In the 2000 
election cycle, the nuclear industry gave nearly $14 million to candidates and 
PACs, with more than 2/3 to Republicans.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A truck or train accident or terrorist attack would
endanger thousands or more and cost millions of
dollars to clean up,&quot; noted Iowa Green Party
gubernatorial candidate Jay Robinson. &quot;On July 9,
Democrats once again joined the GOP behind dangerous
and regressive environmental policy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SUPERFUND: The Bush Administration plans to cut
funding for the Superfund cleanup of 33 toxic waste
sites in 18 states. Eric Schaeffer, a top enforcement
official at the EPA, resigned in February, accusing
the administration of undermining the agency's
crackdown on industrial polluters. Congress has
refused to extend taxes on chemical and oil companies
to fund the cleanup. Chemical manufacturers such as
Dow, DuPont, and BASF contributed over $11 million to
political parties in 2000, with over 9 million going
to Republicans. Neighborhoods near the sites face
health risks from air, soil, and groundwater
contamination.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ENERGY PLAN: Over 100 business executives and
lobbyists for oil, gas, and coal industries crafted
the Bush national energy plan promoting use of fossil
fuels and nuclear energy which cause health problems, pollution, and global warming. 
These companies, including Enron, Chevron Texaco, and Shell Oil, and lobbyists 
have made over $29 million in campaign contributions to federal candidates since 
1999, with 75% of that going to Republicans. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;President Bush has made the Oval Office the Oil
Office,&quot; said Dr. Jonathan Farley, congressional
candidate from Tennessee.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CLIMATE CHANGE: In April 2002, Dr. Robert Watson, an
outspoken advocate of change in global energy
policies, was removed from his position as chair of
the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
under pressure from Bush officials acting in response
to a memo from ExxonMobil, a major Republican campaign contributor ($1,702,470 
since 1999). Global warming is expected to cause drought, raise sea levels, cause 
unstable weather conditions, and increase the spread of infectious disease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When we condemn Bush's withdrawal from Kyoto, let's
not forget that Clinton, after signing on, obstructed
enactment of the Kyoto accords,&quot; said Vivian Houghton,
Green candidate for Delaware Attorney General. &quot;The
delegation sent by Clinton, under the influence of the
same fossil fuel industries now dictating Bush policy, accomplished this during 
the Hague conference in November, 2000. Bush's withdrawal from the treaty was 
the next logical step.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CLEAN AIR: In June 2002, EPA chief Christine Todd
Whitman announced repeal of part of the Clean Air Act
by ending New Source Review for power plants, which
requires new plants and older plants which are
upgrading to install new pollution technologies. The
repeal will exacerbate the spread of asthma (already
epidemic among children in cities), cancer, and
cardiovascular disease. During the 2000 campaign,
electricity, nuclear, mining and petroleum industries
gave over $65 million in political contributions, with
almost 50 million to Republicans.</font></p>
