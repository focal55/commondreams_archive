<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SANTA CRUZ, CA - September 

11 - In an historic act of civil disobedience, members of the Santa Cruz City 

Council have invited the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM), raided 

last week by the Drug Enforcement Administration, to distribute medical marijuana 

to patients in the City Hall courtyard on Sept. 17. During the action, scheduled 

for 3:00 p.m. PDT, members of the council will stand with WAMM members in an act 

of solidarity. This dramatic event, which WAMM lawyer Ben Rice calls &quot;our 

Boston Tea Party,&quot; comes in the midst of a national wave of outrage at the 

DEA's latest raids, including new calls for Congressional action.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> WAMM, a cooperative run 

by and for patients (most with terminal diagnoses), worked closely with local 

authorities, strictly followed California law and local guidelines, and never 

sold marijuana to anyone. Nevertheless, armed DEA agents swooped down on the co-op 

Sept. 5, pointed automatic weapons at paralyzed patients, tore up WAMM's garden, 

and carted off operators Valerie and Mike Corral in handcuffs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The raid -- the latest 

in a series of DEA raids targeting small- scale medical marijuana operations run 

by seriously ill people -- has triggered shock and anger nationwide. U.S. Rep. 

Sam Farr (D-CA), in whose district WAMM is located, called the DEA's action &quot;truly 

outrageous.&quot; Syndicated columnist Clarence Page denounced the raid in a Sept. 

8 Chicago Tribune column that was quickly seconded by editorials in the Seattle 

Times, San Jose Mercury News, and even the conservative Orange County Register.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Register's Sept. 9 

editorial noted that WAMM &quot;was probably the `cleanest' of all operations 

in California&quot; and called the raid &quot;an unwarranted and extreme operation 

against sick people. ... Such cruel raids suggest that a law that can be used 

to terrorize sick people is in need of reconsideration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The raid has energized 

efforts to change the law. In addition to Santa Cruz's unprecedented act of civil 

disobedience, U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) has committed to introducing an 

amendment to the Justice Department's appropriations bill barring the DEA from 

raiding medical marijuana dispensaries operating in accord with state and local 

law. Rep. Farr and House Democratic Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) have already indicated 

their support. Separately, U.S. Reps. William Lacy Clay (D-MO) and Mike Honda 

(D-CA) have newly signed on as cosponsors of H.R. 2592, the States' Rights to 

Medical Marijuana Act, another proposal to end the DEA's attacks on medical marijuana. 

Protests planned for September 22 and 23 in Sacramento, California, and Washington, 

D.C., are expected to draw hundreds of medical marijuana patients and their supporters.</font></p>

<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The DEA has gone 

too far with these cruel and utterly pointless actions,&quot; said Robert Kampia, 

executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project. &quot;The 

courage of the Santa Cruz City Council and the growing anger in Congress are signs 

of a genuine grassroots rebellion all across this country that will put an end 

to these attacks on the sick and vulnerable.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The Marijuana Policy Project 

works to minimize the harm associated with marijuana -- both the consumption of 

marijuana and the laws that are intended to prohibit such use. In association 

with Students for Sensible Drug Policy, MPP will hold its first national conference 

on November 8-10 in Anaheim, California. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org" target="_new">http://www.mpp.org</a>
