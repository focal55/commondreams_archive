YORK - June 13 - President Bush&#8217;s unilateral designation of Abdullah al-Mujahir 
as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; creates a dangerous loophole that threatens 
basic criminal justice guarantees, Human Rights Watch said today.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The president is claiming unfettered power to circumvent the justice 
system and its safeguards of basic rights,&#8221; said Kenneth Roth, Executive 
Director of Human Rights Watch. &#8220;There should be a strong presumption that 
anyone arrested in the United States, far from any battlefield, be granted the 
full legal protections of the criminal justice system&#8212;including the right 
to counsel and not to be held without charges. Simply accusing someone of working 
with al-Qaeda does not justify throwing him into a navy brig.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to U.S. officials, al-Mujahir, originally named Jose Padilla, had 
met with senior al-Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan to plan attacks in 
the United States, including the detonation of a radioactive &#8220;dirty bomb.&#8221; 
Al-Mujahir was detained in Chicago on May 8, and then held in New York as a &#8220;material 
witness.&#8221; This week he was sent to a military base in South Carolina where 
the U.S. government is holding him as an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; without 
charges or access to an attorney.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch noted the contrast between the government&#8217;s decision 
to treat al-Mujahir as an enemy combatant and its decision to prosecute the alleged 
September 11 &#8220;twentieth hijacker,&#8221; Zacarias Moussaoui, on criminal 
charges in a federal district court. Both men allegedly came to the United States 
to carry out acts of violence at the direction of Afghanistan-based al-Qaeda operatives. 
&#8220;The U.S. government apparently wants to be able to question al-Mujahir 
while holding him incommunicado,&#8221; said Roth. &#8220;But the government&#8217;s 
legitimate desire to obtain information about terrorist threats does not entitle 
the president to assume unlimited powers to place in military custody anyone he 
identifies as a terrorist.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Human Rights Watch questions the government&#8217;s contention that international 
humanitarian law &#8211; or the laws of war &#8211; permits the president to unilaterally 
designate al-Mujahir an &#8220;enemy combatant&#8221; who may be held by the military 
without charges or access to an attorney. International humanitarian law applies 
to the international armed conflict in Afghanistan, but it does not apply to any 
and all members of al-Qaeda regardless of their individual involvement with that 
conflict. To maintain its designation of al-Mujahir as an enemy combatant, the 
U.S. government would need to demonstrate to a civilian court a clear nexus between 
his activities and the armed conflict with the United States in Afghanistan. If 
a court determines he is an enemy combatant, then he may be detained without charges 
for the duration of active hostilities, but not indefinitely.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If suspects are apprehended outside areas of armed conflict and have no direct 
connection to the conflict, international humanitarian law is inapplicable. Instead, 
the protections of international human rights law apply. In the case of a U.S. 
citizen detained in the United States, the protections of U.S. constitutional 
law apply as well. These protections include the rights to be formally charged 
and permitted access to counsel.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;To permit a government that is at war in one part of the world to place 
people in military custody without charges elsewhere in the world without demonstrating 
participation in the armed conflict would create a gaping and dangerous loophole 
to basic human rights guarantees,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;Being an accused terrorist 
is not synonymous with being an enemy combatant. Otherwise, the president could 
detain and hold anyone without charges simply by labeling him a member of al-Qaeda.&#8221;</font></p>
