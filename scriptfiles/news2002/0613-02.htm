- June 13 - Americans won't breathe any easier due to an announcement today by 
the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration is expected to announce its plan 
to weaken the clean air protection known as New Source Review. This announcement 
would cripple the Clean Air Act by creating new loopholes that allow factories, 
including power plants and oil refineries, to spew more asthma-causing pollution 
from their smokestacks.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;These polluters have had decades to clean up their act, but they've just 
dragged their feet. Now the President is trying to give polluters permission to 
ignore modern technology and keep fouling our air,&quot; said Carl Pope, executive 
director of the Sierra Club. &quot;Local communities want nearby power plants 
to clean up their acts, but the Bush Administration is turning its backs on communities 
breathing dirty air.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Bush Administration's announcement will weaken &quot;New Source Review,&quot; 
an important Clean Air Act program that requires antiquated power plants and factories 
to install modern pollution-control equipment when they expand. Today's announcement 
creates loopholes, so that some old facilities will be able to increase pollution 
without installing modern pollution fighting technology.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In some places, air pollution is already so bad that kids can't play 
outside during hot summer days without getting sick. But instead of helping kids 
breathe easy, President Bush is letting polluters off the hook,&quot; continued 
Pope. &quot;This announcements puts the interests of big energy companies ahead 
of public health and the environment. Americans want tough enforcement of our 
environmental laws, but the Bush Administration is letting polluters get away 
red-handed.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New Source Review has been instrumental in regulating refineries and power 
plants, which pump millions of tons of pollution into communities. Power plants 
built between 1940 and 1970 emit four to ten times more pollution than modern 
plants. One example is coal-fired power plants that emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury. These pollutants have been found after repeated 
exposure to cause as much damage to human lungs as smoking a pack of cigarettes 
a day. High smog levels in the eastern United States cause 159,000 trips to the 
emergency room, 53,000 hospital admissions, and six million asthma attacks each 
summer.</font></p>
