Ritter, who was a chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq, is the author of <i>Endgame: 

Solving the Iraqi Problem Once and For All</i>. He said this afternoon: "Sen. 

Joe Biden is running a sham hearing. It is clear that Biden and most of the Congressional 

leadership have pre-ordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein 

from power regardless of the facts, and are using these hearings to provide political 

cover for a massive military attack on Iraq. These hearings have nothing to do 

with an objective search for the truth, but rather seek to line up like-minded 

witnesses who will buttress this pre-determined result.... This isn't American 

democracy in action, it's the failure of American democracy. Before we go to war 

with Iraq, we must be able to determine that Iraq poses a threat to the national 

security of the United States. Such a determination must be backed up with substantive 

fact. I believe that Iraq does not pose a threat to the U.S. worthy of war. This 

conclusion is shared by many senior military officers. According to President 

Bush and his advisers, Iraq is known to possess weapons of mass destruction and 

is actively seeking to reconstitute the weapons production capabilities. I bear 

personal witness, through seven years as a chief weapons inspector in Iraq for 

the UN, to both the scope of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and the 

effectiveness of the UN weapons inspectors in ultimately eliminating them. While 

we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the disposition 

of Iraq's proscribed weaponry, we did ascertain a 90-95 percent level of verified 

disarmament. These are the sort of facts that must be included in any hearing 

that seeks to determine the threat posed by Iraq today. It is clear that Sen. 

Biden and his colleagues have no interest in such facts."</p> </font>

As a former UN Assistant Secretary General, Von Sponeck headed the UN "oil-for-food" 

program until he resigned two years ago in protest over the continued sanctions 

on Iraq. He was in Iraq two weeks ago, visited sites purported to be weapons sites 

and found them to be "defunct and destroyed." He said this afternoon: "Evidence 

of al-Qaida/lraq collaboration does not exist.... Six years of revisions to sanctions 

policy on Baghdad have repeatedly promised 'mitigation' of civilian suffering. 

Yet, in 1999, UNICEF confirmed an estimated 5,000 excess child deaths every month 

above the 1989 pre-sanctions rate. Four months ago, UNICEF reported that more 

than 22 per cent of the country's young children remain chronically malnourished. 

Credible opposition groups outside Iraq have called for delinking economic and 

military sanctions. At the March Arab summit in Beirut, all 22 Arab governments 

(including Kuwait) called for the same. If the economic embargo on Iraq is not 

in their interest, then in whose interest is it?"</p></p> </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p align="center">###</p>
