- July 24 - </font> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The House 

of Representatives today voted to pass legislation to ban so-called "partial-birth 

abortion" (H.R. 4965). "We are extremely disappointed that House legislators motivated 

by election year politics voted to pass a deceptive, intentionally vague and unconstitutional 

bill that would jeopardize the lives and health of American women and their families," 

said Vicki Saporta, President and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Supreme Court ruled in June 2000 in Stenberg v. Carhart that

a Nebraska ban on so-called "partial-birth abortion" was

unconstitutional for two reasons: it lacked the necessary exception

for preserving the health of a woman and the definition of the

targeted procedure was so vague as to possibly proscribe other

abortion procedures, thus placing an "undue burden" on a woman's

right to seek an abortion. "H.R. 4965 is even more deceptive than

past attempts to enact restrictive abortion bans because the

authors claim the bill is constitutional even though it clearly

ignores the Supreme Court's ruling. The bill still does not contain

an exception to protect women's health and contains an

intentionally vague definition that would apply to more than one

abortion procedure," Saporta stated.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not only would this unconstitutional legislation jeopardize the

lives and health of women, it would also criminalize doctors for

providing women with appropriate health care. "This legislation

improperly interferes with the doctor-patient relationship and

subjects medical professionals and their patients to dangerous

political game-playing," said Saporta. "Health care providers

should not have to choose between exercising their best medical

judgment for individual patients on a case-by-case basis and going

to jail."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The legislators who voted for H.R. 4965 have shirked their

responsibility and ignored Supreme Court precedent in favor of

playing election year politics with the lives and health of women

and their families," stated Saporta. "NAF would like to extend our

thanks to those legislators who saw through this election year

maneuver and voted against this deceptive, dangerous and blatantly

unconstitutional legislation."
