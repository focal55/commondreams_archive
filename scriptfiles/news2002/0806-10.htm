ANGELES - August 6 - GLAAD DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS JOHN SONEGO -- &quot;When 

John Rocker is quoted as telling a group of gay and transgender people, 'I hope 

you die of AIDS, I hope you cease to exist,' his message and his intent are clear: 

he's targeting gay people with vicious messages of hate and bigotry.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This isn't an isolated 

incident; it's simply the latest of Rocker's homophobic remarks. And Rangers General 

Manager John Hart's claim that Rocker 'acted appropriately' would be laughable 

if it didn't indicate that anti-gay abuse is still acceptable in major league 

baseball. The Texas Rangers and Major League officials have an obligation to hold 

their players, managers and teams accountable for actions like these that disgrace 

the profession.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The day after the 

incident, the Associated Press reported Rocker had released a 'written apology' 

for his actions. The AP should take a second look at what Rocker wrote; it's nothing 

of the sort. It's an attempt to deflect responsibility by blaming the people he 

attacked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Today's Reuters story 

led with Rocker's claims he was provoked into his homophobic epithets, despite 

witness reports to the contrary. People shouldn't be misled by these reports. 

Sports media, including the Associated Press and Reuters, should investigate the 

circumstances thoroughly and report accurately on the nature and context of Rocker's 

epithets, and not simply serve as agreeable conduits for his and his manager's 

feeble excuses for unconscionable behavior.&quot;</font></p>
