- July 27 - This travesty of a vote will be remembered as the Midsummer Night&#8217;s 

Massacre, where growing popular concern about corporate-led globalization was 

shot down in favor of a backwards policy combining corporate managed trade and 

global deregulation of basic consumer, environmental and other public interest 

standards.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the past decade, public opposition to NAFTA-style trade deals has grown 

so strong that now the only way to move this policy is to ram through at 3:00 

a.m. in the dark of night 304 pages of legislation combining five different trade 

bills which was unavailable for public or congressional review until hours before 

the vote.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This Fast Track bill is supposed to set the next five years of U.S. trade and 

globalization policy. If U.S. negotiators follow the outrageous agenda in this 

bill, including a 31-nation NAFTA expansion and global deregulation of food safety, 

accounting, energy and other standards, the resulting agreements would be dead 

on arrival in Congress and in the court of public opinion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A tidal wave of hypocrisy ripped through Washington&#8217;s wee hours. It has 

been a tawdry spectacle to watch the GOP House leadership and President Bush ramming 

through a &quot;trade&quot; bill which has as its main agenda promoting massive 

global corporate deregulation just hours after crowing about passage of new regulations 

aimed at the corporate crime wave caused by the very sort of deregulation this 

bill promotes globally.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trade package included authorization to negotiate a 31-nation Free Trade 

Area of the Americas NAFTA expansion, new limits on enforcement of labor or environmental 

standards in trade agreements, a modest Trade Adjustment Assistance program, and 

an expansion to more nations of the investor-to-state lawsuits of the North American 

Free Trade Agreement, which allows foreign corporations to challenge domestic 

regulatory standards before trade tribunals if they limit future expected profits.</font></p>
