for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) today said that 

justice has at last been served by the guilty verdict in the 1963 

Birmingham church bombing that killed four young girls. A jury 

convicted former Ku Klux Klansman Bobby Frank Cherry of 

first-degree murder. He faces an automatic sentence of life in 

prison. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kweisi Mfume, NAACP president and CEO, said: &quot;Although it has 

taken almost 40-years, justice was finally served in what many 

consider one of the most heinous crimes during the '60 civil rights 

era. All Americans of good will are glad to be able to close this 

final chapter of one of our nation's greatest tragedies. Our 

thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of the 

innocent young girls 11-year-old Denise McNair and 14-year-olds 

Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley. Their 

strength and courage throughout this arduous, painstaking road to 

justice have been inspiring.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A jury of nine whites and three blacks deliberated less than a 

day before returning the verdict against Cherry after a weeklong 

trial. The 71-year-old Cherry is the last suspect to be tried in 

the Sunday, September 15, 1963 dynamite blast at the Sixteenth 

Street Baptist Church. Two other ex-Klansmen were convicted and a 

fourth died without being charged in the deadliest single attack of 

the civil rights movement. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the urging of black ministers, federal authorities reopened 

the case in 1995 that resulted in one conviction in 2001. It had 

closed the case in 1968 without any charges. A state investigation, 

reopened in the 1970s, drew a conviction. </font></p>

Colored People (NAACP) is the nation's oldest and largest civil
