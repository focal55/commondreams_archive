- May 1 - A 15-year-old 

boy who stood up to the local school board in his rural Missouri 

town and a Miami grandmother who overcame religious and community 

backlash to support her gay son, are among this year's Colin 

Higgins Courage Award winners. The awards are given each year to 

honor everyday heroes who demonstrate courage in the face of 

discrimination, intolerance and bigotry based on sexual 

orientation. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We may be tempted to believe that just because 'Will &amp; Grace' 

is a hit TV show and Rosie O'Donnell comes out of the closet, 

equality and acceptance for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 

people is a fait accompli,&quot; said Charles Fernandez, spokesperson 

for the Colin Higgins Foundation and a program officer of the Tides 

Foundation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The experiences of the 2002 Courage Award winners prove that 

there are still blood and tears in the trenches where ordinary 

individuals battle bigotry in their daily lives,&quot; Fernandez said. 

&quot;But most importantly, these heroes teach us that personal bravery 

shines a light on the struggle for LGBT rights, and that each of 

these lights is an important victory.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The winners of the third annual Colin Higgins Courage Awards 

are: </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- D. Patrick Bynum - at the age of 12, this 15-year-old from 

Ozark, Mo., went twice before his local school board to ask for 

protection from beatings and harassment by his classmates. When the 

school board failed to act, he bravely took his battle to the next 

level by filing a complaint with the Department of Education's 

Office for Civil Rights. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Eva Leivas-Andino - the mother of four children, including a 

gay son, and grandmother of two, Eva overcame her own fears and 

prejudices and those of her religious and ethnic community in Miami 

to become a full-time advocate of LBGT youth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Vanessa Duran - As a 17-year-old queer 

African-American-Latina activist, Vannessa has lived a lifetime of 

being labeled and attacked for who she is. But this El Cerrito, 

Calif., youth has transformed her experience into art and activism, 

using film, video and photography as lenses through which to 

explore racism and homophobia. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">-- Calvin Warren - taught by his church that his sexual 

orientation made him the &quot;antithesis of black manhood,&quot; 21-year-old 

Calvin endured threats and regular harassment in his hometown of 

Newburgh, N.Y. to become an outspoken and dedicated gay rights 

activist who will graduate this May from Cornell University. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Colin Higgins Courage Awards recognizes ordinary but 

remarkable individuals who have endured overwhelming hostility and 

hate, yet have handled themselves with the utmost grace as they 

educate and enlighten others about the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 

transgender experience. Each winner receives $10,000 as part of the 

prize. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Colin Higgins, acclaimed screenwriter, director and producer of 

films such as Harold and Maude and Nine to Five, established The 

Colin Higgins Foundation in 1986. In addition to the Courage 

Awards, the Foundation also funds film scholarships and has 

supported over 390 LGBTQQ organizations, ranging from the Gay, 

Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) to gay, lesbian, 

bisexual and transgender outreach and AIDS prevention programs in 

such locations as Fayetteville, AK and Biloxi, MS. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Colin Higgins Foundation is administered by the Tides 

Foundation, a larger parent foundation which partners with donors 

to increase and organize resources for progressive social change. 

In the past decade, the Tides Foundation has awarded more than $100 

million in grants to community-based organizations and progressive 

nonprofits. </font></p>
