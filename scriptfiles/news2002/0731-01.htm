- July 31 - On August 1, two years after Philadelphia's breach of civil rights 

during the Republican National Convention (RNC) protests, the city continues to 

maliciously prosecute those that chose to speak out about societal and political 

problems like excessive incarceration and a &quot;justice&quot; system disproportionately 

affecting people of color and the poor. Additionally, the city has used civil 

suits filed against it to offensively employ tactics of harassment and privacy 

invasion. This is accomplished in large part by an insurance policy given to the 

city by RNC ad-hoc host committee Philadelphia 2000, covering them for violence 

and misconduct.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Timoney-3 case is a 

clear example of the city's zeal to over-prosecute Despite over 95% of the hundreds 

of cases stemming from the RNC protests having been thrown out of court, the city 

of Philadelphia is vigorously prosecuting some of the last and most significant 

cases. One of the more high profile cases involves then-Police Commissioner John 

Timoney accusing three young men of violent behavior. Although many of their charges, 

including felonies, were thrown out in 2001, the Philadelphia District Attorney 

(DA) recently won an appeal that reinstated them. The three defendants are due 

to go to trial on October 9, 2002 in Common Pleas Court. One of the defendants, 

Camilo Viveiros, is a low-income housing activist working mainly with elderly 

and disabled tenants (further info below). &quot;The money that has been spent 

prosecuting frivolous cases including my own,&quot; says Viveiros, &quot;is money 

being taken from worthy and much-needed community based programs in Philadelphia.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">City takes advantage of 

insurance policy covering it for host of civil rights violations The Philadelphia 

Daily News (PDN) reported on Feb. 15, 2001 that Philadelphia 2000-headed by David 

L. Cohen-purchased an insurance policy for the city in order to protect them from 

various civil rights violations. According to FEC filings, the insurance policy 

was purchased for $777,411 and was funded in part from a donation by Philadelphia 

Newspapers, Inc. (owners of the Inquirer and the Daily News) to Philadelphia 2000 

for over $200,000. The umbrella policy purchased from American International Group 

(AIG) covers an undisclosed amount of legal fees currently being used by the city 

in its defense of civil suits. Estimates on fees billed to date are well over 

$2 million. A policy rider purchased from Lexington Insurance of Boston, MA has 

liability limits of $3 million covering the city for such things as assault and 

battery, false arrest, wrongful detention, and malicious prosecution (for policy 

text see below). &quot;Knowing that they were not liable, the police and city 

of Philadelphia conspired to suspend the rights of thousands of people during 

a national political campaign,&quot; claims Danielle Redden of R2K Legal.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">City's law firm racks up 

millions in legal fees while harassing activists and organizations across the 

country One of Philadelphia's most prestigious law firms, Hangley, Aronchick, 

Segal &amp; Pudlin, is defending the city against civil suits for rights violations. 

Due to the firm's financial and human resources, they have been able to go on 

the offense despite their defensive position. Subpoenas and depositions used include 

demands to turnover computer hard drives, e-mail correspondence as well as membership 

lists of political organizations. People were questioned about prominent anarchist 

activists with no connection to the RNC protests. In an especially unusual move, 

the city's lawyers deposed legal council for the plaintiffs on the grounds that 

they co-conspired with their clients to disrupt the RNC. Organizations subpoenaed 

include the Ruckus Society; Women's International League for Peace and Freedom 

(WILPF); Kensington Welfare Rights Union; American Friends Services Committee 

(Quakers); and R2K Legal.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Possible puppet warehouse 

civil suit settlement The puppet warehouse civil suit is one of various suits 

brought against the city in the aftermath of the RNC protests. Of the over seventy 

people arrested in the preemptive warehouse raid, all had their charges dismissed. 

Filed on August 1, 2001, the suit involves twenty-four plaintiffs and makes claims 

of wrongful arrest, lack of due process and other rights violations. PDN reported 

on July 5, 2002 that, &quot;the city is secretly trying to settle federal civil-rights 

lawsuits.&quot; According to court records uncovered by PDN, $72,000 is due to 

be awarded to two local organizations after deducting legal fees. Also reported 

by PDN is a &quot;strict confidentiality agreement&quot; to keep details of any 

settlement secret. &quot;Despite settlement information recently being made public,&quot; 

says Kris Hermes of R2K Legal, &quot;the city's desire for secrecy is yet another 

attempt to control the will of activists and shield any criticism of wrongdoing.&quot;</font></p>
