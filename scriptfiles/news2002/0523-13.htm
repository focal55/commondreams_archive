<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - The first hearing in the Sierra Club's lawsuit against the

Cheney Energy Task Force will be held tomorrow, Thursday, May 23 at 10:00

AM before Judge Emmet Sullivan in Federal District Court.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club argues that by refusing to tell the public what kind of

influence energy industries had over America's national energy policy, the

Cheney task force violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).   The

Sierra Club is asking the court to require Vice President Cheney and other

defendants to disclose to the American people what went on behind closed

doors in the creation of the national energy policy. The suit has been

consolidated with a similar suit filed by Judicial Watch. Tomorrow the

court will consider the U.S. government's motions to dismiss both lawsuits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When the Bush Administration wrote its energy policy, big oil and energy

companies were given the red-carpet treatment, but the public was shut out

of the process,&quot; said Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club.&quot;Americans deserve to know what happened behind those closed doors, and the

law requires it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club filed this lawsuit after the Bush Administration refused to

divulge how much influence big energy companies like Enron and oil and coal

producers had in writing the nation's energy policy, despite numerous

requests from Congress and others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's extremely unfortunate that it takes a lawsuit to learn how much

influence polluting companies had over a policy affecting all Americans and

generations to come.  If the Administration had conducted their meetings in

the light of day, we wouldn't need this lawsuit,&quot; continued Pope.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The energy policy that ultimately came out the Administration relies on

technologies that will pollute our air and water, destroy special places

and fail to reduce our dependence on oil and coal. At the very least, the

American people deserve an explanation of why the Administration chose this

path rather than safer and cleaner technologies that would protect the

environment and save consumers money at the same time.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sierra Club is asking for a full accounting of what happened behind

closed doors of the Cheney Energy Task Force, including:  who was in the

room; what proposals did the energy industry executives and lobbyists make;

what documents did the energy industry submit; and what Task Force

documents did they review.</font></p>
