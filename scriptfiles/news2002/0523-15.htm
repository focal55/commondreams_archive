<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - Friday's nuclear arms 

reductions treaty signing with Russia will allegedly reduce the 

number of nuclear weapons from approximately 7,000 weapon apiece to 

between 1,700-2,200 apiece. President Bush has hailed this treaty 

as &quot;liquidat(ing) the legacy of the Cold War.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Instead of liquidating the nuclear legacy President Bush is, at 

best, only rearranging it,&quot; said Kevin Martin, executive director 

of Peace Action. &quot;His treaty doesn't require any weapons to be 

destroyed, merely set aside in storage where they will be 

vulnerable to theft or rogue use. Past performance and the Bush 

administration's penchant for unilateralism indicates that the 

majority of the weapons eliminations promised under the treaty will 

never come to pass.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because there is no timeline or enforcement protocol for weapons 

elimination, each country can take up to ten years and do little or 

no actual weapons elimination. The treaty also allows for either 

country to withdraw from the treaty-for any reason, including 

non-compliance-on three months notice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The most direct route to a nuclear weapon would be to buy or 

steal one. Putting Russian nuclear weapons in storage instead of 

destroying them will make that poorly guarded arsenal even more 

attractive to terrorists and rogue nations,&quot; continued Martin. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This agreement is further flawed for the obvious opportunities 

that it misses. It does not take the remaining weapons off 

hair-trigger alert-the most obvious way to thwart an accidental 

launch. It also fails to deal with the thousands of smaller, 

tactical weapons that are particularly vulnerable to theft. 

Finally, there will remain a massive overkill capacity in the form 

of up to 2,200 strategic nuclear weapons on each side-dangerously 

in excess of what could be construed as needed for deterrence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Far from ending the threat of nuclear war, President Bush is 

giving that threat new life. The recently leaked Nuclear Posture 

Review (NPR) pointed toward a more useable nuclear force. The 

Senate is currently debating the Administration's request for $15.5 

million to research 'robust nuclear earth penetrators' -- new 

nuclear weapons the administration would potentially use in hopes 

of destroying hardened and deeply buried targets. By developing 

such a weapon, the administration puts the U.S. on the path to 

restarting nuclear testing-ending the moratorium put in place by 

the President's own father. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;How is developing new nuclear weapons liquidating the legacy of 

the Cold War?&quot; asked Martin. &quot;Even at the height of the Cold War, 

the nuclear arsenal was meant to be used only as a deterrent, not 

as a usable weapon. The only way to 'liquidate the legacy of the 

Cold War'-and to address the number one threat to U.S. and world 

security, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction-is for 

the U.S. to get serious about eliminating the scourge of nuclear 

weapons from the face of the Earth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;If the intent of this treaty is to contain the nuclear threat, 

it will be about as useful as a sieve is for containing water,&quot; 

concluded Martin. </font></p>
