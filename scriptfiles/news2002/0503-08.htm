- May 3 - Earthjustice praised

today's federal court decision upholding a key Environmental

Protection Agency regulation requiring cleanup of air pollution

from diesel trucks. The ruling of the US Court of Appeals for the

District of Columbia Circuit rejected challenges from both engine

manufacturers and the petroleum industry. The result is that

Americans will breathe dramatically reduced levels of deadly diesel

pollution.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Diesel trucks and buses have been among the dirtiest pollution

sources for years, causing thousands of premature deaths, and many

more cases of serious illness, every year," said Howard Fox of

Earthjustice, which intervened in the lawsuit on behalf of public

health and environmental groups. "For too long, these big diesel

polluters have been getting a free ride by not having to meet the

same emissions standards as cars. This rule changes that, placing

autos and diesel trucks and buses on a level playing field."

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA in January 2001 issued the regulation that requires

pollution from new heavy-duty trucks and buses to be reduced

dramatically. Responsible for large numbers of deaths,

hospitalizations, and missed workdays each year, particle

pollution, known as soot, is to be reduced by 90 percent under the

rule. Nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of ozone,

known as smog, that causes asthma attacks, respiratory pain, and

reduced lung function, must be cut by 95 percent under the rule. To

make these reductions possible, the rule also mandates a 97 percent

cut in diesel fuel sulfur. The reduction of sulfur is crucial

because sulfur in diesel fuel damages emission control equipment.

The phase-in of the fuel requirement is scheduled to begin in 2006

and the emission requirements are to start in 2007.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EPA estimates that annually the rule will prevent 8,300

premature deaths, more than 9,500 hospitalizations, 5,500 cases of

chronic bronchitis, 17,600 cases of acute bronchitis in children,

and more than 1.5 million lost workdays. The rule also will prevent

cancers from diesel exhaust, which EPA has found to be a likely

carcinogen in humans.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rule was the result of a year-and-a-half of review and five

hearings around the country and is supported by a broad spectrum of

environmental and public health organizations, state officials, and

even industry groups.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The court's ruling was issued in National Petrochemical &amp;

Refiners Association v. USEPA, D.C. Cir. 01-1052. Full text of the

decision is available at
