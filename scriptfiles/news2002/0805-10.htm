- August 5 - The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty Monday called 

on Texas Gov. Rick Perry to acknowledge the role that race and geography play 

in the application of the death penalty, particularly as it relates to juvenile 

offenders, and to stay the scheduled executions of T.J. Jones and Toronto Patterson.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since executions resumed 

in the United States in the 1970s, 19 juvenile offenders have been put to death. 

The past four such executions have each taken place in Texas and each has involved 

an African American inmate. If the scheduled Aug. 8 execution of Jones and the 

scheduled Aug. 28 execution of Patterson are allowed to proceed, it will mean 

that the last six juvenile offender executions in the United States all will have 

taken place in Texas and all will have involved African American inmates.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Texas has accounted 

for 11 of the 19 juvenile offender executions in the United States during the 

past two decades,&#8221; said NCADP Executive Director Steven W. Hawkins. &#8220;Seven 

of the eleven juvenile offenders executed in Texas have been African American 

or Latino. The death penalty in the United States disproportionately affects people 

of color and this is even more true when it comes to juvenile offenders.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hawkins noted that of the 81 juvenile offenders on death row in the United 

States, 52, or almost two thirds, are people of color. Of the 81 inmates, just 

over half &#8211; 42 &#8211; are from Texas or Alabama.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The past four juvenile offenders executed in Texas were Napolean Beazley, executed 

May 28; Gerald Mitchell, executed Oct. 22, 2001; Gary Graham, executed June 22, 

2000; and Glen McGinnis, executed Jan. 25, 2000.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hawkins added that Texas is speeding up its pace of executing juvenile offenders 

even as the international community shuns the practice. Only three countries &#8211; 

the United States, Iran and the Democratic Republic of Congo &#8211; currently 

execute juvenile offenders. Just last week, Pakistan announced it is sparing the 

lives of 72 juvenile offenders while in the Philippines, the Supreme Court ordered 

the removal of a dozen juvenile offenders from death row, ruling that their execution 

would violate the law.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Such executions not only violate international norms, they also offend 

human decency,&#8221; Hawkins said. &#8220;The mind of a juvenile offender is 

by definition less developed than the mind of an adult. Juvenile minds do not 

handle social pressure, instinctual urges and other stresses the way that adult 

minds do. Juvenile offenders therefore cannot be held to the same degree of culpability 

as adults, just as mentally retarded people cannot be held to the same degree 

of culpability. We now ban the execution of mentally retarded offenders. There 

can be little justification for applying a different standard when it comes to 

juveniles.&#8221;</font></p>
