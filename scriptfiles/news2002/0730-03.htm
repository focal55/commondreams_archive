- July 30 - The focus of Senate Republican leaders and President Bush on rising 

medical malpractice insurance premiums is misguided because insurance premiums 

for homeowners, car and health insurance have also increased at about the same 

rate, according to a Public Citizen state-by-state study released today.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The study contends that doctors are victims of insurance companies that made 

bad investment and pricing decisions &#8212; rather than lawyers representing 

victims of medical malpractice. The study analyzes insurance rates in 21 states, 

showing that rate hikes are common in many types of insurance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public Citizen released the study and several fact sheets, and sent a letter 

to members of the U.S. Senate urging them to oppose an amendment offered by U.S. 

Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that would strip medical malpractice victims of their 

state-based rights to seek full compensation for deaths and injuries caused by 

malpractice. The amendment would not only insulate doctors from full accountability, 

it would also protect HMOs, hospitals, nursing homes and even drug and medical 

device companies for deaths and injuries caused by malpractice and defective products.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the wake of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and other corporate scandals, it 

is outrageous that Congress is debating legislation that would reduce corporate 

accountability to the tens of thousands of people who are killed and injured by 

medical malpractice every year,&quot; said Joan Claybrook, president of Public 

Citizen. &quot;It would be a terrible injustice to blame the 80,000 Americans 

who die each year from medical negligence &#8212; and the many thousands more 

who are injured &#8212; for industry practices.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Blaming rising malpractice premiums on a litigation &#8216;crisis&#8217; 

is a smokescreen by the insurance industry to cover for the industry's investment 

losses and price gouging,&quot; said Frank Clemente, director of Public Citizen's 

Congress Watch. &quot;Nothing is happening with medical malpractice premiums that 

isn&#8217;t happening in other insurance arenas.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The states included in the study are Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, 

Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, 

New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington, 

West Virginia and Wisconsin.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The research shows that medical malpractice insurance premiums for the riskiest 

specialties increased 10 percent from 2000 to 2001. Auto insurance premiums increased 

8.4 percent, homeowners insurance premiums increased 8 percent and health insurance 

premiums increased 11 percent in that year.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Further, the number of claims per 100 doctors has remained surprisingly constant 

over the years. And the average medical malpractice payment for all claims closed 

was virtually flat from 1991 ($29,093) to 1996 ($29,504).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Limiting patients&#8217; rights to sue would not reduce health care costs,&quot; 

Clemente said. &quot;The attempt to cut victims&#8217; rights is yet another way 

the administration and Republicans in Congress are trying to help out their big 

business friends.&quot;</font></p>
