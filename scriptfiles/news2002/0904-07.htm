- September 4 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and No to Discrimination/Save 

DADE, today warned all voters opposed to discrimination not to become complacent 

following the release of yesterday's Miami Herald poll predicting the likely failure 

of Question 14 on the Sept. 10 ballot. This referendum would repeal Miami-Dade 

County's ordinance prohibiting discrimination against gay, lesbian and bisexual 

people. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While we are pleased by the implications of today's poll, experience 

has shown us that such numbers can be volatile and ultimately unreliable, especially 

on an emotionally charged issue that hinges on personal biases that can emerge 

in the privacy of the voting booth,&quot; said Lorri L. Jean, Executive Director 

of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example, Colorado's Amendment 2, in 1992, and Maine's Proposition 6, in 

2000, both passed and pre-empted or rolled back equal protections for gay and 

lesbian people despite polls that had strongly indicated that they would fail. 

&quot;We're so committed to winning the battle against bigotry that earlier this 

year we announced plans to donate $50,000 to Save DADE, the local group leading 

the fight to preserve equal rights and to recruit 80 volunteers from around the 

country to identify and mobilize more than 20,000 voters who oppose discrimination 

against gay, lesbian and bisexual people in Miami-Dade. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But frankly, we're so concerned about the lies and distortions of the 

religious fanatics behind Question 14 that earlier this week we increased our 

funding to nearly $100,000,&quot; Jean added. That's among the largest donations 

ever by a GLBT organization to fight an anti-gay ballot measure.&quot; The Task 

Force's grassroots effort has now deployed more than 100 volunteers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the Herald reported in a front-page story yesterday, Question 14 was certified 

for next Tuesday's ballot despite reservations voiced by the county's elections 

chief, a civil suit alleging widespread fraud and an ongoing criminal inquiry 

by special prosecutors that recently resulted in the arrest of the head of the 

Miami Christian Coalition, among others. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heddy Pe&ntilde;a, chairperson of No to Discrimination/SAVE Dade, added, &quot;We're 

pleased that the Task Force understands the only poll that counts is the poll 

taken the day of the vote. They've experienced coming to help communities during 

the final weeks of a campaign only to discover that they were ill-prepared to 

mobilize election day support. They have been working with us for over a year 

to make sure we didn't make that same mistake.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has worked to eliminate prejudice, 

violence and injustice against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people at 

the local, state and national level since its inception in 1973. As part of a 

broader social justice movement for freedom, justice and equality, NGLTF is creating 

a world that respects and celebrates the diversity of human expression and identity 

where all people may fully participate in society. </i></font></p>
