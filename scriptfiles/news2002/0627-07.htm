- June 27 - U.S. PIRG applauds Senator Jeffords and Senator Lieberman for their 
leadership in advancing the Clean Power Act. We urge the full Senate to take up 
this critical bill as expeditiously as possible. Each year that the Congress fails 
to take action to clean up power plant pollution means another year of smog and 
soot, acid rain, mercury poisoning and global warming that we cannot afford.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The significance of this vote cannot 
be overstated. Today the Administration's approach to power plant pollution - 
burying our heads in the sand regarding global warming -- was rejected. A majority 
of EPW Senators insisted that carbon dioxide must be addressed as part of any 
comprehensive power plant clean-up measure. We hope that at this juncture, the 
Administration will abandon its obstinate refusal to engage in a discussion on 
the details of a policy that includes mandatory carbon dioxide emission reductions 
for the power sector.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is worth restating the reasons 
that this legislation is so critical:<br>
* More than 18,000 premature deaths caused by fine particle soot emitted by power 
plants would be prevented each year;<br>
* Hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks triggered by smog-forming power plant 
emissions would be prevented each year;<br>
* Forests and lakes from Maine to Georgia would be able to recover from the impacts 
of acid rain;<br>
* Contamination of fish throughout the nation with the dangerous neurotoxin mercury 
would be dramatically reduced;<br>
* The largest source of global warming pollution in the nation would begin to 
chart a course toward the emission reductions necessary to prevent devastating 
climate changes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today marks an important milestone 
in a battle for public health, the environment, and the future of our planet. 
Now it is time to begin the work to take the next step in the full Senate.</font></p>
