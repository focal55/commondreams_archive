- May 21 - As many as 1,000 domestic and global anti-poverty activists will join forces on May 21st at 4:30 p.m. for a major rally outside the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, to be held at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce near Lafayette Park (16th and H Street, NW), to expose the links between poverty in the United States and abroad.  At 6:00 p.m., they will race to the headquarters of the World Bank/IMF (Murrow Park, 18th and H Streets, NW).</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;1K Race to the Bottom&quot; will pit fat cats against right-wing ideologues in a large-scale street theater demonstration to see who can be the quickest to reach their destination, the headquarters of the World Bank/IMF.  The Race will feature, among other props, larger-than-life puppets of President Bush, a giant silver spoon, and colorful hurdles and hoops that poor people are forced to jump through to get access to basic services at home and abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Activists will highlight the parallels between structural adjustment policies promoted by members of the World Economic Forum and the erosion of the safety net in the United States since Congress passed welfare reform in 1996.  Today, there are more than 31 million people living in poverty in the United States and billions more worldwide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;When Congress ended 'welfare as we know it', they really eliminated the safety net as we know it,&quot; said Deepak Bhargava, Director of the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support.  &quot;This is not unlike what is happening to millions of families around the world who cannot afford basic services like health care and education because of policies devised by institutions like the World Economic Forum.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event takes place one week after the House voted on changes to the 1996 welfare reform law, which has resulted in thousands of families being kicked off the rolls due to punitive time limits and sanctions.  The House bill imposes extreme new work requirements that will force states to place recipients in massive unpaid workfare programs.  Among the proposals being debated in the Senate are provisions that would lift thousands of low-income families out of poverty by providing access to training, education and work supports that will help them get and keep good jobs.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Structural adjustment policies, promoted by organizations like the WEF, require countries receiving international aid to privatize basic social services like education and health care, making them out of reach for most families, many of whom make as little as $1 a day.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The WEF is essentially a multimillion dollar cocktail party in which the financiers and racketeers of corporate globalization brainstorm and informally plan the imposition of 'free market' imperatives upon the rest of the globe.  On the domestic side, the dismantling of welfare is part of their program because it puts more money in their multi-billion dollar pockets,&quot; said Mark Rickling, an organizer with the Mobilization for Global Justice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The event is co-sponsored by the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, who convened a rally of more than 2,000 low-income activists in Washington, D.C. in March.  The Mobilization for Global Justice sponsors protests and educational events that have drawn as many as 30,000 concerned citizens to Washington, DC.</font></p>
