- September 16 - The nonprofit Clean Air Trust today named the National Association 

of Manufacturers the Clean Air "villain of the month" for September 2002. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The manufacturing lobby earned this dubious distinction by

"forming the lobbying equivalent of a flying wedge to help the Bush

Administration jam through a plan to weaken the Clean Air Act,"

explained Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Trust.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The manufacturers seek to knock aside any effort to stop the

Bush plan," said O'Donnell. "This crackback-blocking effort

confirms our worst suspicions - that the Bush plan really would be

a dirty-air touchdown for the big polluters."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to announce

changes that would weaken a key enforcement tool in the law called

"new source review," which requires old smokestack industries to

update their pollution controls if they undergo a major change that

would boost pollution. The EPA plan, developed with the support

of the manufacturing lobby, would permit many more industrial

plants to increase pollution without any controls. (The Clinton

Administration examined a more modest "reform" plan, but the

manufacturing lobby sacked it for being too environmentally

friendly. Former EPA Administrator Carol Browner recently told a

Senate committee that, by contrast, the Bush plan would be a

significant environmental rollback.)

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite requests by three separate Senate committees, EPA has

refused to produce any analysis of the impact of these changes on

air quality. (And no wonder: as one well-informed EPA official

told us confidentially last week, "It's pretty hard to defend what

we are doing.")

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EPA's stonewalling approach has prompted United States Senators,

led by Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.), to explore possible use of the

federal budget process to block EPA from weakening the law.

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enter the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), which

formed the flying wedge to knock aside any Senate attempt to tackle

the EPA plan. Last week, NAM put out a frantic alert: "ACTION

NEEDED: A Senate vote could occur this month! Please urge your

senators to oppose all efforts to block or delay EPA's NSR reforms.

In addition, please inform your senator of the reasons why NSR

reform is needed for business certainty, energy security and

environmental quality. Please call or e-mail your Senator to urge

them to vote against any appropriations rider that attempts to

delay this process."

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NAM also distributed astro-turf letters to be sent from

companies to Senate offices, as well as misleading "talking

points." (Samples of misleading rhetoric: NAM alleges falsely that

current rules block "environmentally beneficial projects." It also

implies that state lawmakers support their position. In fact,

state lawmakers have made it clear they oppose weakening changes

that could lead to increased pollution or a reduction in state

authorities -- two elements of the NAM-backed Bush plan.)

</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the dirty-air lobby and EPA political appointees jointly march towards the 

goal line, defenders of the Clean Air Act need to remember -- this issue IS about 

defending the integrity of the Clean Air Act from this sooty offensive.</font>
