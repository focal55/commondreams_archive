<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 25 - News 
Advisory: </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Wednesday, June 26, Common 
Cause President Scott Harshbarger will hold a press conference in front of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) marking SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt's first 
year in office. Harshbarger will call on the SEC Chairman to recuse himself from 
enforcement actions against his former clients for the remainder of his time in 
office. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Chairman Pitt is highly 
qualified, but his meetings with a former law client and executives of companies 
being investigated by his agency show he still has an uphill battle in ensuring 
average investors that he now works for the American people. That is why we have 
called on him to take this extraordinary step. In addition, his inappropriate 
meetings point to a need for greater disclosure of contacts between the SEC and 
publicly traded corporations. The FCC requires any individuals or groups with 
certain business before its agency to file a report and a summary of what was 
discussed within 24 hours of its occurrence -- the SEC should do the same," Harshbarger 
said. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common Cause is releasing 
a letter to Pitt calling for him to recuse himself from any votes on matters that 
directly affect his former clients for the five-year duration of his term; disclose 
a list of SEC matters on which Pitt has refrained from voting; and release a list 
of all the individuals and groups with whom he has met since taking office on 
August 2. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Common Cause has also written 
Sens. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Phil Gramm (R-Texas) of the Senate Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs Committee to ask that they act swiftly to convene confirmation 
hearings to fill the vacancies on the commission. </font>
