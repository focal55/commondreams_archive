&nbsp;- July 19 - The Green Party of the United States kicked off its 2002 Midterm 
Convention in Philadelphia with the seating of five new states in the party's 
Coordinating Committee and a dramatic challenge from Green candidates against 
the erosion of U.S. democracy by corporate control of the Democratic and Republican 
Parties.</b> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have 78 delegates 
from 39 states, including 6 states that were approved this morning,&quot; said 
Jo Chamberlain, a California Green and member of the party's national steering 
committee. &quot;That includes the District of Columbia, which is seeking statehood.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The five new states are 
North Carolina, Washington, Alaska, Vermont, and Nebraska. The party's Lavender 
Green Caucus, representing gay, lesbian, bi, and transgender Greens, was also 
seated on Thursday morning.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is not a show 
convention, like the national conventions of the Republican and Democratic Parties 
every four years,&quot; said Michael Morrill, Green candidate for governor of 
Pennsylvania. &quot;Every word, every moment of the major party conventions is 
scripted. The Green Party is here in Philadelphia to debate openly and freely, 
and to organize ourselves as a national political force. We in Pennsylvania welcome 
the Green Party to the cradle of American liberty.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We have 155 elected 
officials now, double the number from two years ago,&quot; added Chamberlain. 
&quot;And we have triple the number of candidates over two years ago.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a press conference Thursday 
morning, Green candidates and activists spoke of measures necessary to retrieve 
democracy from what Texan Green David Cobb called &quot;hijacking&quot; by powerful 
corporate interests.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The first thing I'd 
do, if elected, is seize the assets of Enron and bring Ken Lay and his cohorts 
before a grand jury,&quot; said Cobb, the Green candidate for Attorney General 
of Texas. &quot;I'd begin an immediate investigation of Dick Cheney and Halliburton.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Elizabeth Shanklin, candidate 
for Congress in New York's 17th Congressional District, spoke of the need to restore 
the social safety net, especially for women, children, and other vulnerable Americans, 
after years of assault from both Democrats and Republicans. &quot;Corporations, 
seeking quick profits, have betrayed the future. The Green Party is the party 
of the future.&quot;</font></p>
</font>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We need clean money 
for campaigns, voluntary funding as practiced in Maine, Arizona, Vermont, and 
Massachusetts,&quot; said Ted Glick, New Jersey candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
&quot;This would allow candidates to run effective campaigns without corporate 
money.... Corporate boards must include democratically elected representatives 
of their workforces, as well as consumer representatives. And we must repeal the 
Taft-Hartley Act, which limits the right of workers to organize.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glick noted that, after 
voting to limit debate on legislation against corporate abuses last week, 16 Democratic 
senators flew on corporate jets to Nantucket, Mass. for a weekend retreat with 
250 major corporate campaign donors. The flights were donated by BellSouth Corp., 
Eli Lilly and Co., FedEx and AFLAC. Among the Democratic senators were Majority 
Leader Thomas Daschle (S.D.), Joseph R. Biden Jr. (Del.), Hillary Rodham Clinton 
(N.Y.), Edward M. Kennedy (Mass.), John F. Kerry (Mass.), Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) 
and Jon S. Corzine (N.J.).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Under corporate globalization, 
passed by the two parties, corporations have been moving down to Mexico to escape 
environmental and labor protections,&quot; said George Martin, co-chair of the 
Green Party of Wisconsin. &quot;In my lifetime, we've gone back and forth between 
Democrat and Republican, but nothing really gets better. We've suffered globalization, 
lack of national health care, privatization schemes....&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin McKeown discussed 
the recent passage of a living wage law ($10.50 an hour, with medical benefits) 
under Green leadership in Santa Monica, Calif., where he serves as Mayor Pro Tem 
and is up for re-election in November. &quot;The minimum wage is no longer a floor, 
but a sub-basement. Working people deserve a real living wage, and the Green Party 
will help them get it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The convention will continue 
through Sunday; the next press conference takes place Friday at 11 A.M., at which 
Green gubernatorial candidates will be introduced.</font></p>
