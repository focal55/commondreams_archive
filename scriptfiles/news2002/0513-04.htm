- May 13 - Greenpeace announced today the launch of the U.S. component of an international campaign against oil giant ExxonMobil for its efforts to undermine progress on global warming. The environmental group kicked off the campaign with a new report, Denial and Deception: A Chronicle of ExxonMobil's Corruption of the Debate on Global Warming, detailing the company's history of deliberate efforts to hijack the global warming debate through the use of front groups, flawed science and large political contributions. ExxonMobil, the world's largest energy company, has spent millions of dollars to prevent any concerted government action to fight global warming. Specifically, it has worked aggressively to prevent U.S. acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ExxonMobil's stance on global warming can be summed up in three words: deny, deceive and delay,&quot; said Kert Davies, Greenpeace climate campaign coordinator. &quot;Its propaganda machine has been hard at work for more than a decade spewing out junk science, fabricating doubts, and buying support of politicians from the local level all the way to the White House.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group made up of thousands of the world's leading scientists and scientific bodies, has found that global warming is man-made, it will have severe environmental and health impacts if left unchecked, and it is getting worse. Over the next century, a warming of just a few degrees will lead to sea level rise, chaotic weather patterns, agricultural loss and the spread of diseases in North America.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By rejecting the Kyoto Protocol a year ago and proffering an alternative plan on global warming that echoes the views of ExxonMobil, the White House is recycling a version of the failed voluntary plan offered by the first President Bush more than a decade ago. The Greenpeace report details the close connections between President Bush and ExxonMobil that date back to the President's days in Texas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ExxonMobil's finger prints are all over the Bush Administration's stance on global warming,&quot; noted Davies. &quot;Bush global warming policy smells a lot like ExxonMobil.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Greenpeace activists around the world will engage in a week of protests against ExxonMobil from May 13 through May 18.</font></p>
