YORK - July 3 - The DC Campaign for Treatment -- a District-based organization 
formed for the purpose of promoting treatment and other alternatives to help drug 
offenders -- will turn in nearly 40,000 signatures on Monday, July 8 in support 
of Measure 62, the &quot;Treatment Instead of Jail for Certain Non-Violent Drug 
Offenders Initiative of 2002.&quot; The Measure is expected to appear on DC's 
November ballot. If passed, this initiative would allow substance abuse treatment 
rather than incarceration for eligible non-violent, first or second time offenders 
charged with simple possession or use of certain drugs in DC. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This initiative is going to help District residents struggling with addiction 
get the treatment that they need,&quot; said Bill McColl, President of the DC 
Campaign for Treatment and Director of National Affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance. 
&quot;It will keep residents here in the District with their families where they 
belong. Similar initiatives have increased treatment in California and Arizona 
and it will work in the District too.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Campaign has collected more than double the amount of signatures needed 
to qualify the initiative, demonstrating a willingness of DC voters to look for 
alternatives to incarcerating people in need of drug treatment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Signatures are being gathered for similar &quot;treatment instead of jail&quot; 
initiatives in Michigan and Ohio for the November ballot, while another has been 
approved in Florida for 2004. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DC's Measure 62 is modeled after California's Proposition 36 (2000) and Arizona's 
Proposition 200 (1996). California's Legislative Analyst's Office estimated prior 
to passage that Proposition 36 would divert over 36,000 non-violent drug offenders 
to treatment annually, saving California taxpayers approximately $1.5 billion 
over the next five years, and preventing the need for a new prison scheduled for 
construction. In just one year since the passage of Prop. 36, California has increased 
the number of licensed and certified substance abuse slots by 68%. Similarly, 
Proposition 200 in Arizona has diverted 2,600 drug offenders into treatment and 
saved Arizona taxpayers $2.56 million during its first year of implementation 
and over $6 million in prison costs within its second year, according to a study 
by the Arizona Supreme Court. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It just makes sense to treat drug addiction as the health issue that 
it is, instead of wasting millions of taxpayer dollars trying to incarcerate our 
way out of our drug problems,&quot; said Katharine Huffman, Director of State-Based 
Projects at the Drug Policy Alliance.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Measure 62 is being sponsored by the DC Campaign for Treatment -- a collaborative 
effort of the Drug Policy Alliance, the nation's leading organization promoting 
sensible alternatives to the war on drugs, and Campaign for New Drug Policies, 
a national organization aimed to reform drug laws and policies. </font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Drug Policy Alliance is the nation's leading organization working to end 
the war on drugs and promote new drug policies based on common sense, science, 
public health and human rights. The Alliance, headquartered in New York City, 
has offices in Sacramento, Oakland, San Francisco, Washington, DC and Santa Fe, 
New Mexico. </i> </font></p>
