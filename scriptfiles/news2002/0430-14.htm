- April 30 - At a time when the

public is increasingly suspicious of the White House's handling of

environmental policy, the Heritage Forests Campaign is launching a

new TV ad and website --<a href="http://www.allears.org" target="_new"> http://www.allears.org

</a>-- that call on the

Bush administration to keep its promises on national forest

protection.

<p>"The Bush administration has turned a deaf ear to the

overwhelming public support for environmental issues like national

forest protection," said Jane Danowitz, director of the Heritage

Forests Campaign. "The White House could pay a political price if

it continues to listen to big corporations and not the American

public."

<p>The TV ad, entitled "All Ears," criticizes the Bush

administration for failing to uphold the Roadless Area Conservation

Rule, an historic measure to protect 58.5 million acres of pristine

national forest land. The ad calls on the White House to listen to

the overwhelming public support for the roadless rule and cites the

1.6 million comments submitted by Americans favoring national

forest protection. Viewers are also encouraged to visit a new

website --<a href="http://www.allears.org" target="_new"> http://www.allears.org

</a>-- to learn more about the Bush

administration's mishandling of the national forest issue.

Similarly, the Heritage Forests Campaign is running ads in key

locations along the DC Metro and on The Hotline.

<p>www.allears.org provides documentation of promises made by

Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman and Attorney General John

Ashcroft to uphold and defend the roadless rule and cites specific

examples of the Bush administration's failure to keep those

promises. The site also documents the close industry ties to key

officials in the Bush administration and the strong public support

for national forest protection.

<p>The TV ad and website come on the heels of a CNN/Time poll that

shows growing public support for strengthening environmental laws.

According to the poll, only 36 percent of Americans trust President

Bush to protect the environment. As the Congressional campaign

season begins to heat up, the poll also shows the environment to be

one of the top four political issues.

<p>The TV ad hits the airwaves in Washington, D.C. on Thursday,

just one day after Agriculture Secretary Veneman is expected to

make her first appearance before the House Resources Committee.

She is expected to face tough questions about her handling of

national forest policy.
