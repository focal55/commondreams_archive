- June 6 - At a spirited protest in front of an ExxonMobil station on Capital Hill today, U.S.  PIRG called on the oil giant to stay out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and drop its opposition to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.  Dozens of activists from U.S. PIRG, Greenpeace, and the Alaska Wilderness League converged at the ExxonMobil gas station at 2nd St. and Massachusetts Ave. NE at one of more than 15 actions held around the country by the state PIRGs.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It's time for ExxonMobil, the company responsible for the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history -the wreck of the Exxon Valdez - to finally start behaving like a responsible corporate citizen,&quot; said Neal Kemkar of U.S. PIRG. &quot;Today we join activists around the country in calling on ExxonMobil to respect the Arctic and respect the planet.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the second time in the last month, PIRG's pro-environment activists were met by a crowd of pro-ExxonMobil, pro-global warming, and pro-drilling protesters and employees of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). The same crowd greeted activists at the ExxonMobil annual meeting in Dallas on May 29, 2002.  According to the ExxonMobil web site, CEI received $280,000 from the company last year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The good news is that ExxonMobil has begun to take our campaign seriously,&quot; said Athan Manuel, director of PIRG's Arctic Wilderness Campaign.  &quot;The bad news is, that rather than respond to the public outcry to protect the planet they are trying to drown it out.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Exxon Valdez oil spill, and Exxon's handling of the clean up, has become the poster child for corporate irresponsibility. In 1989, more than 11 million gallons of crude oil spewed into Prince William Sound, Alaska, one of the most bountiful marine ecosystems in the world.  According to U.S. PIRG, thirteen years later, oil from the Valdez can still be found in Prudhoe Bay, and ExxonMobil is still behaving badly.  U.S. PIRG pointed out<br>

that:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* The company supports opening up America's Arctic, the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for oil and gas drilling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">* Contrary to overwhelming scientific evidence - and in contrast to their colleagues in the oil industry - the company refuses to acknowledge the reality and consequences of global warming.  Not only do they mislead their shareholders and the public on the issue, ExxonMobil funds questionable researchers and think-tanks in an effort to justify their claim that we do not know whether global warming is happening.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the protest U.S. PIRG also released a new report entitled &quot;Denial and<br>

Deception: A Chronicle of ExxonMobil's Corruption of the Debate on Global Warming&quot;, detailing the company's efforts to hijack the global warming debate through the use of front groups, flawed science and large political contributions.  The report, written by Greenpeace, points out that ExxonMobil has spent millions of dollars to prevent any concerted government action to fight global warming and has worked aggressively to prevent U.S. acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;ExxonMobil's stance on global warming can be summed up in three words: deny, deceive and delay,&quot; said Kemkar. &quot;Its propaganda machine has been hard at work for more than a decade spewing out junk science, fabricating doubts, and influencing elected officials from the local level all the way to the Bush Administration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last month the PIRGs, Greenpeace, Amnesty International and other citizens groups launched the Stop ExxonMobil Alliance. The Alliance has a set of five demands for ExxonMobil, including that they stop drilling and pipeline construction in pristine frontier lands and waters, such as the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, and support the Kyoto Protocol. For more on the Alliance campaign visit www.stopexxonmobil.org.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the last four years, the state PIRGs have conducted a corporate campaign targeting the four oil companies - ExxonMobil, BP, ChevronTexaco, and Phillips Petroleum - that want to drill for oil and gas in the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.  The campaign has filed shareholder resolutions, generated thousands of letters and e-mails to the four companies, and sponsored gas station protests across the country.  For more on the PIRG Arctic Wilderness campaign visit www.savethearctic.com.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge is one of America's last unspoiled places. It remains untouched by roads, development or trails. The coastal plain's 1.5 million acres are the biological heart of the Refuge, and support large populations of caribou, musk oxen, bears, wolves, and migratory birds. It is also the only area along Alaska's entire north slope not open for oil and gas drilling.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;American consumers - indeed, consumers and governments around the world - support our demands,&quot; concluded Kemkar. &quot;Preserving a unique and fragile ecosystem like the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge and reducing emissions that cause global warming would dramatically enhance ExxonMobil's image with the American public.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>PIRGs are non-partisan, non-profit public interest advocacy organizations that are active across the country.</i></font></p>
