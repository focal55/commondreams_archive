- July 23 - A new report from two of the nation's leading environmental groups 

warns of serious threats to people and wildlife stemming from a 2001 Supreme Court 

decision narrowing the scope of federal environmental protection for the nation's 

wetlands. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and the Natural Resources Defense 

Council (NRDC) say the ruling invites the destruction of millions of acres of 

so-called isolated wetlands, eliminating their important role in providing flood 

control, natural water purification and essential wildlife habitat.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report, &quot;Wetlands at Risk: Imperiled Treasures,&quot; details the 

vital role played by isolated wetlands across all regions of the country, highlighting 

the important functions at risk. The report also calls for federal legislation 

that would clarify Congress' view that the protection of isolated wetlands is 

critical to water quality, public safety, wildlife and other public interests, 

including hunting and fishing and that the Clean Water Act protects isolated wetlands 

and other waters. The clarification is essential because tens of thousands acres 

of wetlands of all types continue to be lost each year in spite of Clean Water 

Act protections.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;America can't afford to squander all the benefits these wetlands provide,&quot; 

said Julie Sibbing NWF's wetlands legislative representative. &quot;The court 

may have opened the door to misguided wetlands destruction, but Congress can shut 

it again.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isolated wetlands get their designation from their lack of a direct surface 

connection to other water bodies, though they are critically necessary to the 

healthy functioning of the overall ecosystem. Because isolated wetlands are often 

small or exist only for a short period each year, their importance is often not 

appreciated by policymakers and the public. The lack of awareness of their environmental 

importance makes isolated wetlands especially vulnerable to development.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress included protections for wetlands in the 1972 Clean Water Act. However, 

in January 2001 a divided Supreme Court held that a federal agency had exceeded 

its regulatory authority under the law when it tried to block construction of 

a landfill site that would destroy some 17 acres of seasonal ponds that provide 

habitat for hundreds of migratory birds. (Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook 

County (SWANCC) v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) The court held that habitat protection 

for the birds was not enough to warrant government jurisdiction over the ponds 

and raised the question whether the Clean Water Act protects &quot;non-navigable, 

isolated, intrastate&quot; waters.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The court's ruling has created confusion by leaving open to interpretation 

the question of which wetlands are in fact &quot;isolated.&quot; Some have read 

the decision to mean that isolated wetlands -- possibly comprising as much as 

30 percent of America's wetlands -- are, in fact, excluded from protection under 

the Clean Water Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has the primary 

responsibility for protecting the nation's waters. In the absence of clear guidance 

from EPA interpreting this ruling, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers district offices 

across the country are taking widely varying approaches to jurisdictional questions, 

in some instances declining to protect waters that are still covered by the Clean 

Water Act. In addition to supporting new legislation, NWF and NRDC are urging 

the Bush administration to act quickly and definitively to ensure that federal 

agencies fully understand the limits of the court's ruling and their inherent 

responsibility to safeguard the nation's water resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Supreme Court's ruling makes the future uncertain for millions of 

acres of wetlands, but the Bush administration can clear up the confusion,&quot; 

said Daniel Rosenberg, and attorney with NRDC's Clean Water Project. &quot;It 

all depends on how the administration views wetlands, either as natural treasures 

worthy of protection or as places best suited for landfills, strip malls, parking 

lots, and subdivisions.&quot;</font></p>
