- May 10 - American Family Voices 

(AFV) today recognized the one-year anniversary of Congress' 

request and the Bush Administration's denial of access to White 

House Energy Task Force records. Congressional investigators are 

seeking answers to whether the White House allowed industry to 

shape energy policy and whether steps could have been taken to 

prevent the collapse of Enron. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 10, 2001, the Comptroller General ordered Vice President 

Cheney to provide the General Accounting Office (GAO) with &quot;full 

and complete access&quot; to records of meetings between the Bush 

administration and private-sector members of its Energy Task 

Force. Following the collapse of Enron, the White House opted to 

protect their corporate supporters by hiding behind legal-procedure 

and only releasing selective documents. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The American people and those hurt by Enron's collapse are 

looking for answers, and the only response from the White House is 

selective disclosure and more lawsuits,&quot; said Mike Lux, president 

of American Family Voices. &quot;The Vice President is clearly 

attempting to bury his relationship with Enron and big business in 

legal procedure.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GAO cites a number of federal laws which specify that 

federal energy policy should be developed in a manner that takes 

into account a broad and diverse spectrum of publicly-solicited 

views. To date, the White House has provided only a select few 

edited documents to Congress, adding to speculation that they 

allowed corporate interests to shape energy policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Only after they believed it to be politically advantageous and 

legally required, did the White House feel the need to provide just 

enough information about the energy task force meetings to the 

court system to deflect the concerns of a handful of environmental 

lobbies, Lux added. &quot;Their selective disclosure flies in the face 

of the thousands of Americans adversely affected following the 

collapse of Enron. Vice President Cheney must come clean on what 

he is trying to hide.&quot; </font></p>
