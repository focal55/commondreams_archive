<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- April 25 - 

 &quot;The Senate Energy Bill would have been forward-thinking 

legislation when Grover Cleveland was President, &quot; said Friends of 

the Earth President Brent Blackwelder. &quot;America has the brainpower 

and know-how to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, but we lack 

the leadership to fight the wealthy corporate polluters that steer 

our nation's energy policy.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, the Senate will miss an historic opportunity to 

fundamentally change our nation's energy needs. We applaud our 

Senate champions-Senators Daschle, Kerry and Lieberman-for 

protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Unfortunately, 

omission of Arctic drilling fails to make this good legislation. 

While the bill once promised to help move our energy economy into 

the 21st Century, it now reaffirms our dependency on the dirty 

energy technologies of the past. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Senate will enter a conference committee with the House of 

Representatives hoping to improve the bill. While our hopes are 

high, we must face the facts: conferencing a bad Senate bill with 

a House bill that's even worse will produce an energy plan that is 

bad for the environment, taxpayers and consumers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both House and Senate energy bills fail the American public by 

offering no vision or hope for a clean energy future. The House 

bill exacerbates the past century's pollution pattern of extreme 

preference for oil, coal, and nuclear energy. The bill provides 

nearly $40 billion in taxpayer handouts to polluters allows 

drilling in the Arctic and fails to improve our automobiles' fuel 

economy. The Senate bill once contained promising requirements for 

renewable energy and fuel economy. Senators eviscerated these 

provisions, at the same time adding dangerous new subsidies for the 

nuclear industry. The bill is now the lesser of two evils. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notwithstanding a few heroic voices in the House and Senate, 

clean energy does not stand a chance in this Congress. We are 

capable of running more and more of our economy with fuel cells, 

solar and wind power, and with energy-efficient buildings, motors, 

and appliances. America has the technology and knowledge to reduce 

our reliance on fossil fuels, but institutionally, we lack the 

leadership to fight the multi-billion-dollar oil and auto companies 

that defend the status quo. </font></p>
