Executive director of Africa Action, Booker said today: &quot;African 

governments are being held liable for the cost of failed and often 

grandiose development projects pushed by creditors. Now Africa's people are 

expected to repay huge debts that were largely incurred before their time 

and that did not benefit them. For example, South Africa's white minority 

regime accumulated more than $18 billion in foreign debt in the 15 years 

before apartheid fell. South Africa's neighbors incurred more than $26 

billion in debt during this same period, much of it a result of Pretoria's 

regional war. Today, victims of apartheid are forced to pay the costs of 

their own previous repression. Interest payments on these kinds of loans 

are still sucking resources out of Africa, even though the principal on the 

debt has already been repaid.... The U.S., since it is the dominant 

shareholder in the IMF and World Bank, has the power to change this.... 

Among industrialized countries, the U.S. continues to rank lowest with 0.1 

percent of its GNP in official development assistance, far below the UN 

target of 0.7 percent.&quot;<br>

Administrator for the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa, Mvinjelwa 

said today: &quot;Because the government is spending so much on debt, it says it 

has little for AIDS treatment, milk, healthcare.&quot;<br>

Fletcher, the president of TransAfrica Forum, said today: &quot;The term 

'structural adjustment' is used by the IMF and the World Bank to describe 

an approach to the reorganization of a country's economy in order for it to 

access assistance from international financial institutions. 'Structural 

adjustment' is akin to dealing with a loan shark. Underdeveloped and often 

formerly colonized countries in the global South often go to the 

international financial institutions seeking assistance. They are informed 

that in return for receiving assistance they surrender their sovereignty. 

Rather than an economy based on the needs of the people of that country, 

the economy is reorganized to serve and service the needs of the 

international financial institutions and multinational corporations.&quot;<br>

National coordinator of Jubilee USA, Clarke said today: &quot;Many of the most 

impoverished nations of the world have paid their original debt time and 

again, but because of ever-accumulating interest and the impact of the 

conditions attached to the loans, the countries are never able to overcome 

their debt burdens. A recent report from the World Bank and IMF ... shows 

that only five countries have completed the program since it began in 1996. 

The other 21 countries that have entered HIPC are racing to complete 

endless and harmful conditions set by the World Bank and IMF. To get debt 

relief, countries are required to take out a new loan with the IMF.... Any 

program that requires countries to take out new loans to qualify for debt 

relief is just scandalous.&quot; Vanderslice is outreach coordinator for the group.
