<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON 
- July 17 - Over 200 immigrant students and their supporters from across the country 
convened in Washington, D.C. today to urge their legislators to support higher 
education and legalization for immigrant students. Legislation pending in both 
the House of Representatives and the Senate would provide access to permanent 
residency for some students currently without immigration status allowing them 
to continue their education.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed legislation 
&#8211; the Student Adjustment Act (H.R. 1918), in the House of Representatives, 
and the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors, S. 1291) 
in the Senate &#8211; is a significant development that has received bi-partisan 
support and widespread encouragement from immigrant families, educators, and their 
communities. The proposals reinforce our country&#8217;s commitment to education 
and pledge to support immigrant student achieve their dreams.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Immigrant students made 
their message clear to legislators: their immigration status should not be an 
obstacle to pursue their dreams, including higher education. Most were brought 
here as children and have always called the U.S. their home. They are successful 
students who have graduated or will graduate from U.S. high schools. Now they 
are being denied access to higher education. As a result, their lives are filled 
with uncertainty and their future is put at risk as long as they are not allowed 
to regularize their immigration status.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DREAM and Student Adjustment 
Acts</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under current law, most 
children are dependent on their parents for their immigration status and have 
no means of obtaining legal status even though they may have lived in the U.S. 
for many years. Additionally, federal law discourages states from providing in-state 
tuition or higher education assistance to these children. As a result, most of 
these students would be effectively prohibited from attending college because 
they cannot afford out-of-state tuition and do not qualify for federal or state 
financial aid or student loans. The pending legislation would create positive 
changes allowing immigrant students to continue their education.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the House of Representative, 
the Student Adjustment Act (H.R. 1918) was introduced last year by Representative 
Chris Cannon (R-UT) and co-sponsored by representatives Howard Berman (D-CA) and 
Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA). In the Senate the Development, Relief, and Education 
for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act (S. 1291), sponsored by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) 
and Richard Durbin (D-IL) would, like H.R. 1918, eliminate the federal provision 
that discourages states from providing in-state tuition, and provide an opportunity 
for immigrant students to obtain legal status. Sponsors of both bills spoke at 
the Immigrant Students Day press conference on Capitol Hill in support of the 
legislation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National Network for 
Immigrant and Refugee Rights joined with other national organizations, including 
the National Immigration Law Center, National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American Friends Service 
Committee, and others to organize today&#8217;s activities in Washington.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Catherine Tactaquin of the National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights 
explained, &#8220;This legislation would give students the green light to further 
their education and realize their dreams to help their communities.&#8221; Ang&eacute;lica 
Salas from the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles affirmed, 
&#8220;These are great kids and we here in this country can&#8217;t afford to 
prevent these young people from realizing their dreams.&#8221;</font>
