- July 1 - The non-profit Clean Air 
Trust had the following reaction to today's media stunt by EPA 
Administrator Christine Todd Whitman: </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Ten months ago, EPA's professional staff concluded that 
`business as usual' - enforcement of the Clean Air Act - would mean 
less pollution throughout the nation, including the Southeast, than 
would replacing the law with an Enron-style emission-trading 
scheme,&quot; noted Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air 
Trust. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Now, Whitman is trying to argue the opposite. In what can only 
be assumed as an effort appease financial contributors from the 
coal and electric power industries, EPA has, in effect, cooked the 
books to make the Bush Administration's plan seem more favorable. 
Perhaps EPA has hired some of those Arthur Andersen accountants to 
help cook the books,&quot; said O'Donnell. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He noted that the Bush Administration wants to weaken and even 
eliminate new source review. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This is the core EPA rule that protects national parks such as 
the Great Smoky Mountains National Park,&quot; where Whitman appeared 
today, said O'Donnell. &quot;Astonishingly, EPA wants to gut this clean 
air program, which helps protect visibility and prevent significant 
air quality degradation in the parks.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Whitman recently admitted that she hadn't read a federal report 
- posted on EPA's web site and written by agencies, including EPA 
- that pointed out human activities are causing global warming,&quot; 
O'Donnell said. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Perhaps the Clean Air Act and its core rules are something else Whitman 
hasn't read,&quot; said O'Donnell. </font></p>
