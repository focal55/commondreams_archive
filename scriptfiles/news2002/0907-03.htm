FRANCISCO - September 7 - The second trial of 50 of the &quot;Cairo 52&quot; men 

continued in Cairo today. The 50 defendants include both those who were acquitted 

as well as those who were convicted in an earlier trial that ended November 14, 

2001.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At today's hearing, Judge Hassan Al-Sayef took steps favorable to the defense. 

The Judge issued a summons to the police who were responsible for the Queen Boat 

arrests; at the next hearing, these police officers may be submitted to cross-examination 

for the first time. Judge Al-Sayef also approved a motion requesting daily records 

of 3 downtown police stations for the 5 days preceding the raid of the Queen Boat 

in the night of May 10/11, 2001. Defense attorneys have argued that proper arrest 

procedures had not been not followed, that the arrests had been made at random, 

and that charges had been fabricated by ambitious vice squad officers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The hearing today was encouraging,&quot; stated Scott Long, Program Director 

of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC). &quot;At 

the same time, we are receiving new reports of internet entrapment and continuous 

arrests of suspected homosexuals in Egypt. We will remain vigilant until all 50 

men are declared innocent, and the harassment stops.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The defendants were first 

arrested on or around the night of May 10/11, 2001. That night, police raided 

the Queen Boat discotheque in Cairo, believed to be a gay men's gathering place; 

other police pickups followed in the next days. The 52 were tortured in detention, 

and jailed continuously until their trial. (For more information on procedural 

irregularities and abuses surrounding the trial, see IGLHRC's Fact Sheet, &quot;Egyptian 

Justice on Trial: The Case of the Cairo 52,&quot; at <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/world/africa/Egypt2001Oct.html" target="_new">http://www.iglhrc.org/world/africa/Egypt2001Oct.html</a>.)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 52 pleaded innocent. The verdicts were handed down on November 14, 2001, 

at a hearing attended by a representative of IGLHRC, among others. Twenty-one 

defendants were convicted of the &quot;habitual practice of debauchery&quot; under 

Article 9(c) of Law 10/1961 (on the Combat of Prostitution). One defendant was 

convicted of &quot;contempt for religion&quot; under Article 98f of the Penal 

Code. Another defendant, accused of being the &quot;ringleader,&quot; was convicted 

of both charges and received the heaviest sentence, five years of hard labor. 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late May, the State Security Office for the Ratification of Verdicts--an 

arm of the Egyptian presidency which is the only possible review for decisions 

of Emergency State Security Courts--cancelled the court decisions in the 50 cases 

involving the &quot;habitual practice of debauchery.&quot; The grounds were that 

this crime did not merit trial before the repressive special courts. The convictions 

of the two defendants for &quot;contempt of religion&quot; were upheld. All but 

those two now face a second trial.</font></p>
