GEORGIA - August 9 - Thirty-five U.S. activists return today from a ten-day human 

rights delegation to Colombia. They will engage in a nonviolent direct action 

at the School of the Americas (renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security 

Cooperation) in Ft. Benning, Georgia on Sunday morning, at 11AM. The group shares 

concerns over current US policy towards Colombia, including a military aid package 

of historic proportions, a highly controversial program of aerial fumigation of 

coca, and the human rights implications of training Colombian soldiers abroad 

and at the SOA/WHISC.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The current program of massive military aid to this war-torn country 

is like pouring gasoline on a fire,&#8221; said Carol Richardson, one of the delegates.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOA Watch and Witness for Peace sponsored the delegation. These groups hold 

that U.S. military aid exacerbates violence in Colombia. Human Rights Watch and 

the US State Department have documented links between the Colombian military and 

illegal paramilitary forces responsible for 70% of Colombia&#8217;s civilian killings. 

Since the US began sending aircraft and on-the-ground training to Colombia in 

2000, politically motivated killings have risen from 14 to 20 per day, and the 

number of kidnappings and disappearances has doubled. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Colombia has sent 10,000 soldiers to the SOA/WHISC. The SOA/WHISC is a combat 

training school for Latin American soldiers. Its graduates are consistently involved 

in human rights atrocities. In 1996 the Pentagon was forced to release training 

manuals used at the school that advocated the use of torture, extortion and execution. 

In December 2000 Congress authorized the WHISC to replace the SOA. The renaming 

of the school was widely viewed as an attempt to diffuse public criticism and 

to disassociate the school from its reputation. SOA Watch maintains that the underlying 

purpose of the school, to control the economic and political systems of Latin 

America by training and influencing Latin American militaries, remains the same.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Colombia has sent more soldiers to this school than any other country, 

and it has the worst human rights record to date in the Western Hemisphere,&#8221; 

said Carrie Eikler, one of the delegates.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SOA Watch works to stand in solidarity with people of Latin America, to change 

oppressive US foreign policy, and to close the SOA/WHISC.
