- July 22 - On July 23, 2002, the Senate Judiciary Committee will consider the 

nomination of Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The National 

Abortion Federation opposes the nomination of Priscilla Owen because of her troubling 

record of judicial activism and demonstrated bias against reproductive rights. 

</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NAF has reviewed Owen's record in parental notification cases which have come 

before her as a Texas Supreme Court Justice. Owen's record displays a consistent 

bias against young women seeking abortions. In all five parental notification 

cases where there has been a written opinion (and in eleven out of twelve total 

parental notification decisions), Owen has regularly voted to deny young women 

access to abortion. In so doing, she has disregarded her proper role as an impartial 

judge in furtherance of her personal ideology. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In these cases, Owen has attempted to impose unconstitutional religious requirements 

on minors, and has trivialized such serious factors as abuse, parental disownment, 

and medical risks. Owen has explicitly refused to abide by the rule of law in 

regard to the parental notification statute's judicial bypass provision, which 

she dismisses as something which the legislature &quot;surely&quot; could not 

have intended. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This blatant lack of judicial restraint has been so extreme as to warrant condemnation 

from other conservative judges. Even White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, has 

chastised Owen for her &quot;unconscionable judicial activism.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The National Abortion Federation believes Priscilla Owen lacks the appropriate 

and necessary judicial restraint and impartiality required for a federal appellate 

judge. NAF urges the Senate Judiciary committee to reject the nomination of Priscilla 

Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. </font></p>
