<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - June 26 - The 
Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reported last month (5/31/02) that at the behest of 
a Likud party minister, the Israel Broadcasting Authority has banned its editorial 
departments from using the terms &quot;settlers&quot; or &quot;settlements&quot; 
on radio and TV. According to Ha'aretz, &quot;it is not clear if the editors will 
obey the order,&quot; which was seen as an attempt by the new IBA director to 
curry favor with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. What does seem clear is that settlements-- 
housing built on land illegally seized by Israel after the 1967 war-- are such 
a contentious issue within Israel that the Israeli government would like to stop 
reporters from even saying the word.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nonetheless, the opinion pages of 
an Israeli paper like Ha'aretz often show a franker debate over Israel's aggressive 
settlement policy than one can generally find in mainstream U.S. media. Direct 
government interference doesn't seem to have been necessary to convince some major 
U.S. news outlets to avoid honest investigation of settlements, and sometimes 
even to avoid the word itself.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;neighborhood&quot; of Gilo</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This may be partly due to campaigns 
by pressure groups within the U.S. Take the case of Gilo, an Israeli settlement 
that some pro-settler groups have used as a focal point for their campaigns to 
eliminate the term &quot;settlements&quot; in favor of &quot;neighborhoods.&quot; 
In September 2001, CNN changed its policy on how to characterize Gilo: &quot;We 
refer to Gilo as 'a Jewish neighborhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem, built on 
land occupied by Israel in 1967.' We don't refer to it as a settlement,&quot; 
said the order from CNN headquarters. CNN denies that its decision was a concession 
to outside pressure, but according to veteran Middle East reporter Robert Fisk 
(London Independent, 9/3/01), sources within the network said that the switch 
followed &quot;months of internal debate in CNN, which has been constantly criticized 
by CNN Watch, honestreporting.com and other pro-Israeli pressure groups.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CNN is far from the only outlet that 
has trouble identifying Gilo. Media critic Ali Abunimah pointed out in a June 
20 letter to NPR that the network's coverage of the recent suicide bombings which 
killed 26 Israelis incorrectly asserted that the attacks took place in &quot;Jerusalem.&quot; 
In fact, they occurred in the settlements of Gilo and French Hill, both of which 
are outside of Jerusalem's traditional city limits, on land illegally annexed 
by Israel. Abunimah explained that &quot;while absolutely nothing can justify 
such attacks... geographical accuracy in reporting remains supremely important,&quot; 
especially given the emotional intensity of the subject.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A close reading of some of the New 
York Times' recent coverage of settlements illustrates the politics that may be 
at work in such cases. In a May 29 article about Palestinian attacks on Israelis, 
Times correspondent John Kifner reported the Israeli army's efforts to erect fortified 
barriers between Bethlehem and Gilo, which Kifner described as &quot;a nearby 
East Jerusalem neighborhood, where a sprawling Jewish area has been built on land 
seized after the war of 1967.&quot; The sentence would have been a lot easier 
to parse if Kifner had called Gilo what it is: an Israeli settlement.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Kifner indicated, Gilo is built 
on land seized by Israel after the 1967 war. What the Times left unsaid, however, 
is that this seizure is illegal under international law. Gilo, like other Israeli 
settlements on &quot;seized&quot; land, was built in violation of U.N. Security 
Council Resolution 446, which states that Israeli settlements built on land occupied 
since 1967 &quot;have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to 
achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.&quot; Resolution 446 also calls 
on Israel to observe the Fourth Geneva Convention, which states that an occupying 
power &quot;shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population 
into the territory it occupies.&quot; Since 446 was passed in 1979, the U.N. has 
issued other resolutions &quot;deploring&quot; Israel's failure to comply with 
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, Gilo's status as an illegal 
settlement does not justify the Palestinian killings of civilians there, but it 
is central to understanding why Gilo is such a hot spot. For news outlets to report 
on Gilo simply as a Jerusalem neighborhood under attack, without explaining its 
legal status, is a gross distortion-- especially since the Israeli/Palestinian 
conflict, which has claimed so many thousands of lives, is at bottom about who 
should control the land. Settlements have been a central point of contention throughout.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the Israeli human rights 
group B'Tselem, the settler population in the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) 
increased almost 100 percent between 1993 and 2000, and there are now 380,000 
Israelis living in West Bank settlements (including East Jerusalem). In a May 
13 report, &quot;Land Grab,&quot; B'Tselem argues that this illegal growth is 
a result of Israel's policy of de facto annexing Palestinian land through a variety 
of mechanisms, including economic incentives for settlers so large that in the 
year 2000, &quot;settlement regional councils received grants averaging 165 percent 
more than their counterparts in Israel.&quot; B'Tselem found that while &quot;the 
built-up areas of the settlements&quot; constitute only 1.7 percent of the West 
Bank, the settlements' broad municipal boundaries and their regional councils 
mean that in fact, settlements control a full 41.9 percent of West Bank land.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Struggles and shrieks </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The New York Times certainly isn't 
the only or worst offender in terms of inaccurate coverage of settlements, but 
some of its recent articles are instructive in how poor attention to detail on 
settlements can muddy the waters in an outlet's coverage of the Israeli/Palestinian 
conflict as a whole. Kifner's May 30 Times article about 6 Israeli civilians killed 
by Palestinians does consistently use the term &quot;settlement&quot; where appropriate. 
But the article's lead seems crafted to give the impression that the legality 
of settlements is simply a matter of perpective. Kifner described one of the people 
killed as &quot;a 17-year-old yeshiva student in what he believed to be the land 
of Israel who was killed by a Palestinian gunman who believed the land was his.&quot; 
The question of legality is not clarified elsewhere. The sympathy shown throughout 
the article for the Israeli victims and their loved ones is perfectly appropriate. 
What's less appropriate, however, is Kifner's failure to contextualize the complicated 
and deadly issue of settlements in a framework of international law.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kifner repeated this &quot;he says, 
she says&quot; approach in a June 4 article. He described the construction of 
an Israeli multi-million dollar luxury development on Palestinian land as something 
that would be &quot;a neighborhood to Jews, a settlement to Arabs.&quot; Explaining 
the enormous growth in the settler population since the 1993 Oslo accords, Kifner 
noted that settlements have &quot;generated Palestinian anger and frustration.&quot; 
Again, this gives the impression that there's no arbiter in the controversy, only 
the emotional claims of competing ethnic groups.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sources cited in the Times article 
give additional insight into how U.S. cultural affinities may be influencing the 
slant of American reporting on settlements. Canvassing local perspectives on the 
luxury development, Kifner spoke with both Jews and Palestinians. Or rather, he 
spoke with those that he shared a language with.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jerusalem's mayor is quoted explaining 
that the new construction is a sign of the positive influence of &quot;diligent 
private entrepreneurs that know how to make economic considerations,&quot; and 
one of the developers &quot;proudly&quot; extolled the amenities of the &quot;neighborhood&quot; 
being built. In a striking contrast, the Arabs quoted by Kifner are presented 
as simply shrieking garbled objections-- because they didn't speak English:</font></p>
<p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Arabs down the slope were 
less sanguine. In a grocery store, the anger was palpable. 'This land, my father, 
my cousin,' said the owner, Mohammed Abedat, struggling in limited English. 'Turkey 
here, Britannia here, Israel no.'</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;An old woman, dressed in a 
traditional embroidered garment, shrieked at a passing bulldozer.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It seems that in the Israeli/Palestinian 
conflict, a lot can get lost in translation.</font></p>
