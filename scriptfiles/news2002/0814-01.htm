- August 14 - Members of the Green Party of the United States have expressed concern 

that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) has targeted activists from around the world 

who are working for peace in Israel and the Palestinian territories, as well as 

Palestinian and Israeli peace activists.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Clearly, nonviolent protest and our solidarity is the only way that the 

occupation will end,&quot; said Justine McCabe, co-chair of the Connecticut Greens 

and member of the Green Party's International Committee. McCabe has assisted Palestinian 

and international relief workers in Bethlehem and Ramalah. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sadly, the IDF's violent response today to these courageous internationals 

is what peacefully resisting Palestinians have known on a steady basis for over 

35 years,&quot; McCabe added. &quot;Although they endure the same wretched conditions 

as Palestinians while in the Occupied Territories, many of the internationals 

can go home, back to safety to shore up for the next round. Palestinians living 

under occupation have no safe place. They risk their lives every day just to remain 

in their homes, on their own land.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to eyewitness reports on August 7, Israeli police and soldiers used 

percussion grenades, tear gas, and helicopters to quash a nonviolent demonstration 

at the Huwara checkpoint near Nablus by Palestinian, American, French, and Irish 

members of the International Solidarity Movement, including New York members of 

Jews Against the Occupation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McCabe noted that &quot;this isn't the first time the IDF has used U.S. guns 

to fire on U.S. citizens.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Greens have criticized the bipartisan support of the U.S. Congress and the 

White House for Israel's continued illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, 

which has led to the escalating slaughter of innocent people on both sides, invasion 

and assassination, and the bulldozing of Palestinian homes to make way for Israeli 

settlements.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The media show us pictures and footage of the terrible, self-defeating 

murder of innocent Israelis by Palestinian suicide bombers,&quot; said Holly Hart, 

Green candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Iowa and member of People for Justice 

in Palestine. &quot;But few Americans are aware of the heroic efforts by many 

Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict through nonviolent negotiation 

and resistance to Israel's sustained onslaught.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Columnist Robert Novak, writing in TownHall.com on June 17, revealed Prime 

Minister Ariel Sharon's candid comments about his government's goals in a closed-door 

meeting with U.S. Senators during Sharon's visit in June: &quot;Sharon pointed 

to no Israeli-Palestinian deal for at least 10 years&quot; and &quot;committ[ed] 

himself to a hundred-year war against Arabs.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sharon startled the Senators by calling for increased immigration to Israel 

and reminding them that &quot;the ancient boundaries of the 'Land of Israel' [Judaea 

and Samaria, including the West Bank] are guaranteed to the Jewish people by Holy 

Scripture.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The only way we'll see Israel reverse its illegal treatment of Palestinians 

and withdraw from the occupied territories is through massive pressure from the 

U.S., including a threat to end aid to Israel,&quot; said Charles Pillsbury, Green 

candidate for Connecticut's 3rd Congressional District. &quot;Unfortunately, there 

is nearly unqualified bipartisan support for the Sharon agenda, except for a very 

few courageous Congressmembers such as Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D.-Ga.), who has 

been targeted for defeat in her bid for reelection this year for her views. Sharon 

is not only supported by Jewish pro-Israel lobbies but by even more powerful conservative 

pro-Israel Christian fundamentalists -- the very people who are dictating Bush 

policy.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Green Party of the United States has joined human rights groups, the European 

Federation of Green Parties, the Palestinian Authority, the U.N. Commission on 

Human Rights, and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in repeated calls for an international 

protection force for all civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. </font></p>
