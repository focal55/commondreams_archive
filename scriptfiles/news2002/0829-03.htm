<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - August 29 - 

Smog monitors in 42 states and the District of Columbia recorded more than 4,600 

instances during which Americans were exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution 

in 2001, with Houston and San Bernardino residents hardest hit, according to the 

Danger In The Air study released today by U.S. PIRG. Moreover, partial 2002 data 

shows that the number of exceedances will triple or even quadruple in some states 

compared to 2001. The report comes as the White House reviews final regulations 

making it easier for major smog sources like power plants and refineries to avoid 

pollution clean-up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Millions of Americans 

have felt the impacts of 2002's brutal smog season,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Staff 

Attorney Rebecca Stanfield, co-author of the report. &quot;If they're breathing 

the same air we are, the Bush administration should scrap its proposal to let 

polluters off the hook,&quot; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ground-level ozone or &quot;smog&quot; 

is a dangerous respiratory irritant that affects the health of millions of Americans 

each year. Mountains of research have established a link between smog levels and 

asthma attacks numbering in the millions each year. Recent studies have even linked 

smog with mortality from strokes and with the onset of asthma in children and 

adults. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Danger In The Air contains 

data from a network of more than a thousand ozone monitors across the nation. 

Among the reports findings are:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the 2001 ozone season, 

the national health standard for ozone of .08 parts per million averaged over 

an 8-hour period was exceeded on no fewer than 4,634 occasions at monitors in 

42 states and the District of Columbia. </font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The old, less-protective 

1-hour ozone standard of .12 parts per million was exceeded on at least 533 occasions 

in 31 states and the District of Columbia.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2001 saw roughly 10.3% 

more exceedances of the health standard nationwide than 2000.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">California, Pennsylvania 

and Texas were the smoggiest states based on the number of exceedances of the 

health standard. Behind these states were Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, 

Wisconsin, Michigan and Virginia.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The states with the highest 

number of &quot;smog days&quot;-days during which at least one exceedance of the 

8-hour standard was recorded-included California, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 

Ohio, North Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, Massachusetts and Connecticut.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People in San Bernardino 

County, CA and Harris County, TX were exposed to the highest concentrations of 

smog in the nation.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regionally, the New England, 

Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states had significantly more smog in 2001 than in 

2000, while the Southeast and Western states had less smog in 2001 than in 2000.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to summarizing 

data from 2001, U.S. PIRG analyzed preliminary 2002 ozone data from 20 states 

and the District of Columbia and found that:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even with the smog season 

still in full swing, the number of ozone exceedances recorded in these 20 states 

combined is more than double the number in those states for all of 2000 and 60% 

more than recorded in these states in all of 2001.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of August 11, the state 

of Indiana had already experienced 432 ozone exceedances, more than quadruple 

the number recorded in either 2000 or 2001.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of August 13, the state 

of North Carolina had already recorded 544 8-hour ozone exceedances, compared 

to 182 throughout the entire 2001 ozone season. </font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of August 11, the state 

of Illinois had already experienced 175 ozone exceedances, again more than quadruple 

the number recorded in either 2000 or 2001.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As of August 27, the state 

of South Carolina had already experienced 174 exceedances; triple the number from 

all of 2001.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other states that have 

already seen more ozone exceedances in 2002 than in the entire ozone seasons of 

2000 and 2001 include: Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, 

Delaware, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Virginia, West Virginia, Iowa and 

Vermont.</font></li>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While there are many 

factors contributing to ups and downs of smog levels, the one factor we can control 

is the amount of smog-forming pollution we put into the air,&quot; said Stanfield. 

&quot;We may have to live with the heat and the geography we're given, but Americans 

don't have to live with this smog crisis. We have pollution control technologies 

that can cut emissions to a tiny fraction of current levels if the political will 

is there to enforce the law,&quot; she continued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report suggests five 

policy solutions to begin to solve the smog problem, including:</font></p>

<ul>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aggressive enforcement 

the New Source Review program of the Clean Air Act by both states and the U.S. 

EPA.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Timely designations of 

areas that are out of attainment with the national health standard for ozone by 

U.S. EPA.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adoption of a comprehensive 

new program to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide 

and mercury from power plants, such as the one proposed by the authors of the 

Clean Power Act, passed this summer by the Senate Environment and Public Works 

Committee.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adoption of federal emission 

standards for non-road diesel engines used in construction and farm equipment, 

as well as new standards for the diesel fuel that is used in these engines.</font></li>

<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adopt mandates and incentive 

programs to stimulate the market for advanced technology vehicles such as electric, 

fuel cell and hybrid cars.</font></li>

</ul>
