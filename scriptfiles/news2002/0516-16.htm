- May 16 - The following is a 

statement of NARAL President Kate Michelman on Planned Parenthood 

of the Columbia/Willamette v. American Coalition of Life Activists 

(ACLA): </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;NARAL applauds today's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of 

Appeals recognizing that the Nuremberg Files website and the two &quot;WANTED&quot; posters targeting specific doctors constitute true 

threats. This ruling sends a clear message to those who use 

threats and violence against physicians who perform abortions that 

such behavior is illegal, and deplorable. It is a victory for 

physicians around the country and for a woman's right to choose.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As the Court held: 'There is substantial evidence that these 

posters were prepared and disseminated to intimidate physicians 

from providing reproductive health services. Thus, ACLA was 

appropriately found liable for a true threat to intimidate under 

FACE' (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act).&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Anti-choice extremists must take responsibility for the 

damaging effect of their harsh rhetoric. When physicians who 

provide abortions are referred to as &quot;evil&quot;, &quot;murderers&quot;, and &quot;butchers&quot;, a culture of intolerance and hatred is sure to follow. 

These threats of violence are very real. Indeed, Drs. Britton, 

Gunn, and Slepian were all targeted prior to being murdered by 

anti-choice extremists.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Today's decision demonstrates in stark terms the importance of 

the Schumer/Hatch Amendment to the pending bankruptcy bill. Six of 

the Nuremberg files defendants, hours before their asset 

depositions, filed for bankruptcy as part of a litigation strategy 

designed to avoid paying their fines.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Health care professionals who risk their lives everyday to 

ensure women's access to complete reproductive health care deserve 

the right to live and work without the threat of violence.&quot; </font></p>

<p></p>
