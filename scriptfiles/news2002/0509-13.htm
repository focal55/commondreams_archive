<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - May 9 -  A growing number of large companies are electing to &quot;reincorporate&quot; from the U.S. to Bermuda in order to reduce their overall tax liability. Today, investors are gathering to oppose Stanley Works' reincorporation to Bermuda.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

A reincorporation to Bermuda can be accomplished by a paper transaction involving little more than setting up a mail drop there and paying nominal fees. Some companies don't bother to even open an office in their 'new' home.</font>

</p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe this trend represents a significant threat to shareholders and the pension funds of working people. These reincorporations can diminish shareholders' rights, and set in motion a 'race to the bottom' that generally lowers the standards of corporate accountability. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nabors Industries is another company attempting to reincorporate. On June 3rd, Nabors Industries is seeking shareholder approval to reincorporate in Bermuda. The principle reason Nabors gives for reincorporating is lower tax bills, although Nabors does not quantify the savings. A coalition of institutional investors-the Amalgamated Bank, the AFL-CIO, the Central Laborers' Pension Fund and the Laborers' International Union of North America-are opposing the move, based on concerns about its adverse impact on shareholder rights and doubts over the economic benefits of the reincorporation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress and regulators are taking a hard look at such reincorporations, and may take action to eliminate any theoretical tax advantage. According to a recent New York Times article, proposed legislation has gained so much momentum that something may be enacted this year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the benefits of such a reincorporation are uncertain, the adverse impact on shareholder rights is not. Procedural impediments as well as the substantive differences in Bermuda law would make it more difficult to hold Nabors, its officers and directors legally accountable in the event of wrongdoing. If Nabors reincorporates to Bermuda, it could be significantly more time consuming and expensive to hold Nabors or its officers and directors accountable in U.S. courts. Moreover, Bermuda law limits the ability of shareholders to pursue derivative claims against officers and directors for breach of their fiduciary duty to the company. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light of highly-publicized recent events at other publicly traded companies, worker pension funds have become more sensitive to issues of corporate accountability. We want to be sure we are able to seek appropriate legal remedies on behalf of our worker beneficiaries in the event of any corporate wrongdoing-and reincorporating to Bermuda would limit our ability to do so.</font></p>
