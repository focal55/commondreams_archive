- July 25 - Progressive Majority, a growing network dedicated to electing progressive 

candidates at the federal and state levels, today announced the launch of a new 

campaign -- "Drugs Not Dog Food." The campaign is designed to promote comprehensive 

prescription drug coverage by bluntly and clearly demonstrating how high the stakes 

are for our nation's seniors. A petition at <a href="http://www.DrugsNotDogFood.com" target="_new">www.DrugsNotDogFood.com</a> 

offers citizens the chance to send a message for President Bush. To graphically 

make the point about the stark choices many people must make to meet the ever-rising 

cost of prescription drugs, Progressive Majority will send one dog biscuit to 

the President for each signature gathered. 

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Every day, senior citizens are forced to go to extreme lengths to pay for 

life-saving medicine," said Gloria Totten, executive director of Progressive Majority. 

"Many forgo basic necessities to cover the rising costs of medication. And yet, 

the President and the Republicans in Congress refuse to enact the necessary reform 

to end this national tragedy." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Send a Message (and a Dog Biscuit) to the President </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The heart of the new effort is an online petition at <a href="http://www.DrugsNotDogFood.com" target="_new">http://www.DrugsNotDogFood.com</a>, 

enabling supporters to send a message to President Bush urging him to support 

reasonable, decent coverage for prescription medicine. Progressive Majority intends 

to compile the signatures and send them to President Bush -- along with the dog 

biscuits. The site also offers information on the issue, including case studies 

from actual seniors. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Some might find this shocking, but it's nowhere near as offensive as what 

senior citizens are forced to endure on a daily basis," said Totten. "Splitting 

doses, making choices between medicine and food, or simply going without medication 

altogether -- and enduring the harmful consequences. We need to tell the President 

to stop playing politics, and we need to work to elect progressive candidates 

this fall who will stand up for the needs of senior citizens." </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>About Progressive Majority <br>

For too long, progressives have either been silent -- or needlessly defensive 

-- in important debates over what matters. That era is over. There's a new network 

of people who know that progressive values and practical politics are a winning 

hand. Welcome to Progressive Majority. We are building a growing network of new 

leaders and regular folks who share progressive values -- and who will work together 

to elect progressive champions. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.ProgressiveMajority.org" target="_new">http://www.ProgressiveMajority.org</a>.
