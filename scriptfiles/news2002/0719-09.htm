FRANCISCO - July 19 - Monday July 22, Governor Davis will sign into law the first 

bill in U.S. history to regulate global warming pollution from cars and light-duty 

trucks, ending a contentious two-year campaign. Assembly Bill 1493 puts California 

at the forefront in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of global 

warming.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The Governor&#8217;s willingness to take up arms in the global warming 

battle truly distinguishes him from other leaders,&#8221; said Dr. Long. &#8220;By 

signing this bill, Governor Davis demonstrates the kind of vision, courage, and 

leadership that Californians have come to expect from our elected officials,&#8221; 

said Russell Long, Executive Director of Bluewater Network, the organization responsible 

for drafting the bill in January 2001.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;California can, and will force the automakers to do what they should 

have done years ago, and give us cleaner cars.&#8221; Long concluded, &#8220;Time 

after time, our state has proven that protecting the environment is consistent 

with protecting our economy -- this reasonable bill adds to that legacy. By refusing 

to protect our nation from global warming, Mr. Bush has thrown down the gauntlet 

to the States. California is up to the challenge.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assembly Bill 1493 is the successor to AB 1058, the global warming bill championed 

by Assembly Member Fran Pavley for the past two years. The new legislation includes 

language addressing public fears stirred up by an auto industry campaign, including 

explicit prohibition of new taxes, speed limit reductions, or mandatory reductions 

in vehicle weights. In addition, AB 1493 calls for an immediate policy hearing 

on the greenhouse gas emissions standard, once it is set by the California Air 

Resources Board.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just like AB 1058, AB 1493 instructs the California Air Resources Board to 

develop the maximum technologically feasible, cost-effective reductions of greenhouse 

gases by January 2005. Auto manufacturers will be given maximum flexibility to 

decide how to achieve these standards, and consumers&#8217; pocketbooks will be 

protected by a requirement that the regulation be economical to the owners and 

operators of passenger vehicles. Additionally, AB 1493 will provide consumers 

with more vehicle choices and help reduce dependence on Mid-East oil.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although AB 1493 is a state bill, the regulations are ultimately expected to 

extend beyond California&#8217;s borders. Automakers may offer cleaner vehicles 

in other states, since the California vehicle market is so large that it may not 

make sense to create special California models. And other states may follow suit 

with their own legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </font></p>
