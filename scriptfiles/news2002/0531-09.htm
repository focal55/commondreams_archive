- May 31 - Leaders of the Digital Empowerment Campaign responded today to recent comments from Michael Gallagher, deputy director of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, calling the digital divide a &quot;serious issue,&quot; and saying that the Administration is focused on providing &quot;digital opportunities.&quot;

</font>

<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Mr. Gallagher's comments,&quot; said Wade Henderson, Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the nation's oldest and largest civil and human rights coalition, &quot;are a step in the right direction for federal technology policy and we welcome them.&quot;  The Leadership Conference is one of over 110 public interest organizations seeking to preserve and strengthen the federal government's leadership in expanding opportunities in the Digital Age.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But more is needed, said Henderson:  &quot;We believe fervently that the Administration needs to back-up these comments with strong action to protect two critical but endangered digital divide programs - the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) and the Community Technology Centers Program (CTC).  TOP and CTC create opportunities for low-income urban and rural residents by helping them gain access to technology and the Internet.  Both programs are slated for elimination in the Administration's FY03 budget. We call on Mr. Gallagher and others in the federal government to push to restore funding for the TOP and CTC programs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Others in the campaign coalition agreed:  &quot;The TOP program has been instrumental in overcoming economic, geographic and technological obstacles so that Native Americans can participate in distance learning, engage in e-commerce, and gain employment skills,&quot; said Jacqueline Johnson, Executive Director of the National Congress of American Indians.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an example, she cited a three-year TOP grant that enabled the Southwest Navajo Nation in Arizona to construct a satellite network linking 110 chapters across 25,000 square miles of the sprawling Navajo nation.  &quot;With high levels of poverty and low penetration rates for cable television, cellular telephone and regular phone service,&quot; Ms. Johnson concluded, &quot;this network has become the only link to the outside world for many residents of this reservation.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Henderson also cited the critical need for supporting community technology centers, stating: &quot;Community technology centers in our cities have proven to be extraordinarily valuable in developing technology skills in young and old alike.&quot;  He continued:  &quot;It has been thrilling for me to watch how seed money from the CTC program helped establish the Baltimore Urban League's Community Technology Project, where adults attend free classes on the basics of using technology applications and children participate in robotics or multimedia camps.  The federal investment in community technology centers is too important to be diluted or eliminated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citing the importance of technology skills to this information age economy, Angela Glover Blackwell, President of PolicyLink, said,  &quot;The rapid development and expanding uses of technology combined with the huge number of Americans lacking access, threatens U.S. economic competitiveness.  To effectively compete, everyone's skills are needed. The digital divide is a national concern deserving national attention and public policies aimed at closing the gap.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Digital Empowerment Campaign includes over 110 civil rights, public interest, education, health, religious, labor, women's, community development, and technology organizations.  The Campaign was launched on May 15, 2002, on the steps of the U.S Capitol.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of the launch, a letter signed by representatives of Campaign organizations as well as representatives of public interest media and high-tech organizations that urged continued support for the Community Technology Centers (CTC) program and the Technology Opportunity Program

(TOP) was sent to Congress. </font></p>
