- April 24 - 

On Monday evening, the U.S. government succeeded in ousting Jose Bustani, the director-general of the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In today's <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, a French ambassador says that a

potential "chain reaction risks leading to the destruction of the

multilateral system." The following analysts are available for interviews:

In a column published by the British <i>Guardian</i> newspaper on April 16, Monbiot wrote:

"On Sunday, the U.S. government will launch an international coup ... to

unseat the man in charge of ridding the world of chemical weapons."

Monbiot, author of <i>Captive State</i> and visiting professor of politics at

the University of Keele in England, said today: "Two weeks ago, the U.S.

Ambassador to the UN in Vienna failed, for the first time, to attend a meeting

of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.... A week ago, the <i>Washington Post</i>

revealed that the Pentagon had told the CIA to investigate Hans Blix, the chief

UN weapons inspector, in the hope of undermining his credibility. When the CIA

failed to discover any evidence of wrongdoing, the deputy defense secretary is

reported to have 'hit the ceiling'.... On Monday, the U.S. government forced

the departure of Jose Bustani, director-general of the Organization for the

Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.... These recent attempts to undermine

international treaties are being pursued with an eye to the impending war with

Iraq.... The U.S. justification for war is that Saddam Hussein may possess

weapons of mass destruction. So the two foremost obstacles to war were Blix and

Bustani, who have proposed nonviolent methods of getting rid of these

weapons.... The ousting of Bustani was done in an illegal manner -- there is no

provision for removing the head of such an agency in midterm."

Author of <i>UN for Beginners</i>, Williams said today: "The administration accused Bustani of 'ongoing financial mismanagement, demoralization of the Technical Secretariat

staff, and ill-considered initiatives.' The main accuser is John Bolton,

Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. Bolton

used to be the in-house UN-basher for the right-wing Heritage Foundation....

Ironically for someone who spent years saying that the U.S. should get out of

the United Nations, Bolton was recently revealed as taking money from Taiwan to

advise them on how to get into the organization.... Bustani's biggest 'crime'

was trying to persuade Iraq to sign the [chemical arms] convention, which could

mean that OPCW inspectors would inspect Iraqi facilities."

Principal editor of the recent report "Rule of Power or Rule of Law? An Assessment of U.S.

Policies and Actions Regarding Security-Related Treaties," Deller said

today: "The U.S. has undermined the chemical weapons treaty by passing

legislation that conflicts with the terms of the inspection provisions of the

treaty.... This is part of a pattern, as our report found that the U.S. has

violated, compromised, or acted to undermine in some crucial way every treaty

that we have studied in detail."
