- July 31 - &quot;Women across the country are grateful to the 35 senators who 

bucked the White House's pressure campaign and chose ethics over politics,&quot; 

said National Organization for Women (NOW) President Kim Gandy. Judge D. Brooks 

Smith was confirmed by the Senate 64-35 today. &quot;Judge Smith is unfit to serve 

on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, despite the outrageous statements of his 

chief defender, Sen. Orrin Hatch, who defamed Smith's detractors instead of dealing 

with the real issues.&quot; </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Code of Judicial Ethics exists for a reason, and a judge like Smith 

who won't abide by those rules has no place on any bench, let alone on the U.S. 

Court of Appeal.&quot; NOW has strongly opposed the nomination of D. Brooks Smith 

for a lifetime seat as an appellate judge. Among other problems, Judge Smith violated 

the judicial conduct rules by remaining a member of the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun 

Club, which discriminates against women. In 1988, when he was being considered 

for the lifetime District Court judgeship he now holds, he acknowledged that keeping 

his membership would violate judicial ethics, and he promised the committee that 

he would resign if the club didn't change its rules. It didn't and he didn't, 

until this seat came open on the Third Circuit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In Tuesday night's Senate hearing, right-wing senators like Orrin Hatch 

(R-UT) and Rick Santorum (R-PA) twisted the facts about Judge Smith and painted 

a false picture of the advocates who oppose his nomination,&quot; Gandy said. 

&quot;With their insulting comparisons to women's fly-fishing clubs, Senators 

Hatch and Santorum dismissed the experiences of business and professional women 

across this country who have been excluded from the business connections that 

come with membership in clubs like Spruce Creek.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smith even acknowledged that his Senate sponsor for the judgeship he now holds, 

the late Sen. John Heinz, was a member of that club. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet Sen. Hatch, taking a page from the &quot;best defense is a good offense&quot; 

book, tried to distract attention from the Judge's membership in a discriminatory 

club (which even Smith acknowledged was a violation of judicial ethics) by arguing 

that such limitations infringe on Smith's freedom of association guaranteed under 

the First Amendment. To the contrary, federal judges have a responsibility to 

decide many sensitive questions, discrimination among them, and victims of discrimination 

who appear in their courts deserve to face judges who are intolerant of discrimination 

in all its forms. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Senate had an opportunity, with this vote, to say that ethics matter, 

and that discrimination against women is not trivial,&quot; concluded Gandy. </font></p>
