- August 5 - In a closely watched case with national significance, a Florida court 

ruled today that voucher aid to religious schools violates the Florida state constitution.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Circuit Judge P. Kevin Davey of Tallahassee ruled that the constitution is 

&quot;clear and unambiguous&quot; in preventing tax support for sectarian institutions, 

including religious schools. A state program that pays for tuition for some students 

at religious schools violates that mandate, Davey ruled in Holmes v. Bush.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans United for Separation of Church and State and allied organizations 

brought the challenge to the Florida program, which was initiated by Gov. Jeb 

Bush. Bush and his brother, President George W. Bush, are strong advocates of 

voucher schemes that benefit private education.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In June, the U.S. Supreme Court held that voucher programs that aid religious 

schools do not violate the church-state provisions of the U.S. Constitution. However, 

over two thirds of the states have state constitutions that are more explicit 

in their prohibition of tax support for religion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Article 1, Section 3 of Florida's state constitution, for example, says, &quot;No 

revenue of the state or any political subdivision or agency thereof shall ever 

be taken from the public treasury directly or indirectly in aid of any church, 

sect, or religious denomination or in aid of any sectarian institution.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation 

of Church and State, said the decision will have national implications.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Florida court's decision shows that the battle over vouchers is far 

from over,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;I expect to see similar decisions against vouchers 

in state courts around the country.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Bush brothers' plan to funnel funds to religious schools just ran 

into a major roadblock,&quot; Lynn added.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lynn noted that voucher programs are unpopular with most Americans. In ballot 

referenda in 2000 voters from every racial, religious, socio-economic and political 

group voted against giving tax aid to religious schools.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, 

D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization educates Americans about the importance 

of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom.</i></font></p>
