Professor of physics at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, Pakistan, Hoodbhoy said today:

"Nuclear affairs are now being guided by wishful, delusional thinking. The

most frightening delusion is India's trivialization of Pakistan's nuclear

capability.... Lacking any desire for political settlement ... <i>jihadists</i>

in Kashmir [are attempting to] provoke full-scale war between India and

Pakistan, destabilize Musharraf, and settle scores with the U.S.... Many

observers have noted that attacks on Indian civilians coincided with the visits

of high officials from Western countries. Could the upcoming visits by Richard

Armitage and Rumsfeld provide a trigger for the next atrocity and a nuclear

war?"

Rao, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, has just returned from India. He said today: "In both India and Pakistan much of the rhetoric is

aimed at a domestic audience. It's a race to the bottom. In Pakistan there's

been a series of dictatorships while in India there's been more of a tradition

of democracy, but there's been a growth of extremist ideology in both. In

India, the BJP Hindu fundamentalist party has used fascist ideology and

violence to mask narrow economic agendas. It has used the Kashmir question to

galvanize the population. Now, the BJP is benefitting from the silent majority

seeing a benefit from cooperating with the U.S. and the anti-Islamic rubric of

the 'war on terrorism.' The U.S. is asserting its power overtly with money and

covertly with intelligence...."

Author of <i>The New Crusade: America's War Against Terrorism</i>, Mahajan said today: "The

'you're with us or you're with the terrorists,' 'axis of evil,' 'ready for

preemptive action' rhetoric, combined with bellicose U.S. actions, not just in

Afghanistan, but also towards Iraq -- less directly towards Venezuela, Cuba,

Somalia, potentially others -- has naturally created a climate in which

non-superpower states argue that they can take similar license as the U.S.

already has -- Sharon in Israel, Vajpayee in India.... The governments of India

and Pakistan do have an interest in a limited war -- a border skirmish with

hundreds or thousands of deaths -- to help stabilize both governments

domestically. They have no interest in all-out war of a conventional kind, let

alone nuclear."

Research staffer at the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University, Ramana is coauthor of a recent <i>Scientific American</i> article, "India, Pakistan

and the Bomb." He said today: "From what we know, India and Pakistan

have not yet deployed their nuclear weapons.... Even under these circumstances,

if India launched attacks across the line of control in Kashmir, it could

result in a full-scale war, possibly leading to nuclear war.... The new U.S.

nuclear posture review calls for expanding the role of nuclear weapons. That

could act as a model for India and Pakistan in terms of thinking about using

nuclear weapons on the battlefield. Despite the rhetoric around the recent accord

between Bush and Putin, the U.S. and Russia still have thousands of nuclear

weapons deployed, many on hair-trigger alert. As part of its efforts at

defusing the India-Pakistan crisis and urging India and Pakistan to not deploy

their nuclear weapons, the U.S. should follow what it preaches by de-alerting

its missiles."
