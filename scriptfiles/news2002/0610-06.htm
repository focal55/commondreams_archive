- June 10 - In response to warnings 

that school bus pollution could be harming America's children, 

Congress may soon help school districts replace their oldest, 

dirtiest school buses with clean fuel models, saving localities at 

least $85,000 per bus. Unfortunately, less than one percent of 

children that ride in school buses will benefit from these cleaner 

school buses, while millions of children will continue to ride 

high-polluting models. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;More than 20 million children ride in diesel school buses, 

which belch toxic soot from tailpipes,&quot; said Patricia Monahan, 

senior analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists. &quot;While the 

legislation will replace about 2,000 polluting buses, over 400,000 

dirty buses will remain on the road. Congress is poised to take an 

important first step in reducing school bus pollution, but we have 

a long way to go to solve this problem.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tight budgets force school districts to choose between books and 

buses. The national legislation relieves this financial burden by 

providing funds for districts to replace older, high-polluting 

buses with clean-burning buses powered by natural gas, other 

alternative fuels, or cleaner diesel. These cleaner buses can 

reduce the amount of toxic soot emitted from diesel school bus 

tailpipes by over 98 percent. School districts only contribute 

$15,000 to the cost of a bus that normally would come with a price 

tag between $100,000 and $140,000. Unfortunately, the program is 

tucked in controversial energy legislation that deepens our 

nation's oil dependence. Under the leadership of Reps. Boehlert 

(R-N.Y.) and Udall (D-Colo.), the U.S. House of Representatives 

included $300 million for cleaner school buses in a bill they 

passed last summer. Senator Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) championed similar 

legislation which passed the Senate in April. A final decision on 

the energy package will be decided later this year. It is crucial 

that as Congress finalizes the federal budget, it fully fund the 

program at the $300 million level. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UCS recently conducted the first pollution analysis of school 

buses across the country to determine where children are being 

harmed the most. More than 20 states flunked or nearly flunked the 

report card. California and Washington ranked worst, while only six 

states and the District of Columbia ranked &quot;ahead of the curve.&quot; 

A study from Yale University found that children riding school 

buses breathe five to 15 times more particulate soot than children 

playing outside. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Parents in all states should work with their local leaders to 

ensure that they receive a fair share of the new school bus 

funding,&quot; said Monahan, author of the UCS school bus report. </font></p>
