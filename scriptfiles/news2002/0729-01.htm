<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">KABUL, AFGHANISTAN - July 

29 - As Afghanistan&#8217;s first international conference on antipersonnel landmines 

gets underway today, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) and the 

Afghan Campaign to Ban Landmines (ACBL) will call on President Hamid Karzai and 

his Government to join the battle against antipersonnel landmines by acceding 

to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which prohibits all use, production, stockpiling 

and trade of these weapons. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;For many, 'Afghanistan' 

is almost synonymous with 'landmines.' And 'landmine' is synonymous with the devastation 

of war,&quot; said the ICBL's Ambassador Jody Williams, co-recipient with the 

ICBL of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize and special guest at the conference. &quot;But 

Afghanistan is now moving beyond war and a mine-free future for the people of 

the country is now conceivable&quot;, said Williams. &quot;To achieve this, the 

government, including local commanders, must commit to never again use antipersonnel 

mines and to destroy their stockpiles. Sustained donor support is also needed 

for the country's ongoing mine action work and victim assistance and rehabilitation 

activities,&quot; she added.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Government of Afghanistan is hosting the conference, &quot;Building a Peaceful 

Future for Afghanistan: A Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines&quot;, in Kabul from 

28 to 31 July, which has been organised in co-operation with the ACBL, ICBL and 

the United Nations' Mine Action Centre for Afghanistan (MACA).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The event promises to highlight the mine problem in this, the world's most 

mine-affected country. All but two of Afghanistan's provinces are contaminated 

with antipersonnel mines following more than two decades of war. For years, millions 

of mines have hindered development and relief efforts, posing a threat to civilians, 

aid workers, peacekeepers and military personnel alike. Some 150 to 300 people 

are killed or injured by landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) each month, 

according to MACA.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These deaths and casualties rose sharply as civilians fled into unfamiliar 

and often mined areas during the recent conflict. Now mines threaten the lives 

and limbs of refugees and displaced people returning in their large numbers to 

Afghanistan from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mine action activities were severely affected by the recent conflict: work 

came to a halt after September 11 and clearance and survey equipment and facilities 

were damaged and lost as a result of air strikes and looting. Today the country's 

long established mine clearance, survey and mine risk education programmes are 

operating at full capacity once more and many having expanded their work into 

previously inaccessible areas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With sustained donor support, the country's 360 square kilometres of high priority 

mined areas could be cleared within ten years, and possibly sooner. When this 

important farming and residential land, is cleaned up, along with roads and irrigation 

canals, Afghans will be able get back to a normal life.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Antipersonnel mines are the main obstacle to our country's peace and 

development and this conference will help to galvanise national and international 

support to end this scourge&quot;, said Fazel Karim Fazel, who heads the ACBL. 

&quot;With so many people returning home to rebuild their lives, it is clear that 

we need to re-double our efforts to rid Afghanistan of these weapons of destruction&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Afghanistan's neighbours also have mine problems, most significantly India 

and Pakistan which started using mines again along their shared border in December 

last year. If Afghanistan commits to join the Treaty and eradicate landmines, 

it could stand alongside Cambodia and Kosovo as an example of how the mine problem 

can be reversed. It would also send a strong message to neighbouring countries 

and others that are amongst the 50 countries outside the Treaty, including China, 

Russia and the United States.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background about the treaty</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty is the international agreement that comprehensively 

bans antipersonnel landmines. Sometimes referred to as the Ottawa convention, 

it is officially titled: the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, 

Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the 143 states that have joined the treaty, a total of 125 have ratified 

or acceded, most recently Angola. Another 18 are signatories but have not yet 

taken the step of ratification which is required to make the Treaty legally binding 

at a national level. A great deal of headway has been made since the treaty came 

into force in March 1999: production of antipersonnel mines has dropped considerably 

and trade has almost come to a halt; vast tracts of land have been cleared and 

put back into productive use; there has been widespread and extensive destruction 

of stockpiled mines; and most importantly, there are now fewer mine victims.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new international norm, which prohibits mine use by anyone, is gathering 

strength. More and more states are joining the treaty and working hard to implement 

it fully. An increasing number of non-signatory states are responding to international 

pressure and abiding by the spirit of the agreement. However, not all the news 

is encouraging. Continued mine use by states and non-state actors in several conflicts 

is of grave concern and ongoing mine production in about a dozen countries remains 

a problem.</font></p>
