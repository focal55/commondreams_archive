- July 23 - A coalition of environmental groups began running ads this week in 

a number of Washington DC Metro stations this weekend urging citizens to take 

action to &quot;Stop the Bush Administration's Attack on Clean Air.&quot;</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Metro ads, sponsored by the Save Our Environment coalition of national 

environmental groups, feature a young girl using an asthma inhaler, with the legend: 

&quot;She'll have to use this more often&#8230; because the Bush Administration 

is weakening the Clean Air Act.&quot; The ads are currently scheduled to be in 

Metro stations including Capitol South, Farragut North, Farragut West and Federal 

Triangle until August 31.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Bush Administration, backed by the coal, electric and oil industries, 

has proposed the most devastating attack on the Clean Air Act in its 30-year history,&quot; 

said U.S. PIRG Clean Air Advocate Becky Stanfield. &quot;Washington area residents 

who enjoyed only one &quot;good&quot; air quality day in June can ill afford changes 

that will increase pollution and delay cleanup of power plants and refineries,&quot; 

she continued.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Administration announced in June that it would finalize regulatory changes 

to the &quot;New Source Review&quot; program that would allow older power plants, 

refineries, chemical facilities and other industries to modify their operations 

in ways that will increase pollution levels without installing modern pollution 

controls, as required by today's law. This move could result in pollution increases 

at more than 17,000 facilities, and has the potential to increase emissions by 

hundreds of thousands of tons per year across the nation. Pollution from old, 

coal-burning power plants across the nation trigger an estimated 30,000 premature 

deaths and hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks annually. Dirty power plants 

within fifty miles of Washington DC cause an estimated 260 premature deaths and 

thousands of asthma attacks each year.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Electric utilities pushed for weakening the NSR rules during the 2000 Presidential 

campaign and in the early months of the Bush Administration. Documents have emerged 

showing that the Cheney Energy Task Force met and exchanged memos with Southern 

Company executives on the issue. The Bush energy plan issued last spring included 

a mandate to review the regulations as well as dozens of ongoing enforcement actions. 

A subsequent comment period drew comments from 130,000 concerned citizens opposing 

any move to weaken clean air rules.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ads were designed by Jennifer Burton of Penczer Burton Media. The ads direct 

readers to <a href="http://www.saveourenvironment.org" target="_new">www.saveourenvironment.org</a> 

for more information, reports, fact sheets, and to take action on the issue.</font></p>
