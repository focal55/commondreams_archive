- July 24 - &quot;U.S. PIRG cannot believe that the conferees have chosen to make 

deals behind closed doors. The only deal you should cut is to pass a strong bill 

that's a good deal for consumers and investors. The final bill should prevent 

cheating, punish criminals and protect small investors.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a minimum, the final package should be the Senate-passed Sarbanes-Leahy 

bill. We can give the conference a passing grade if it rejects all the Oxley-Gramm/accounting 

industry weakening amendments. The Senate bill includes critical provisions that 

cannot be deleted or gutted. We should lengthen the statute of limitations to 

protect victims. We should protect corporate whistleblowers. We should make corporate 

boards and CEOs accountable.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ideally, the conferees will strengthen the Senate-passed bill. That would be 

the best deal for consumers and small investors. We doubt they can do so behind 

closed doors, but here's what they should do:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* First, strengthen the 

auditor independence requirements and toughen the oversight board.<br>

* Second, add two amendments that weren't even considered on the Senate floor.<br>

* (1) Add the Levin-McCain amendment to require proper expensing of stock options.<br>

* (2) Add the Shelby-LaFalce amendment to restore aiding and abetting liability 

to lawyers, accountants and investment bankers and others who act as accomplices 

to corporate crooks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are pleased to join Reps. 

Gephardt and LaFalce today. We especially want to commend Mr. LaFalce for his 

longtime leadership on behalf of consumers. Thank you for the opportunity to be 

here today.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consumer and Investor Report 

Card for Grading the Accounting and Corporate Reform Bill Conference Committee 

Report</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two-part test of a final 

Accounting and Corporate Reform Bill is simple: First, is it strong enough to 

deter accounting fraud and corporate misconduct to guarantee that the markets 

pick winners, not cheaters? Second, when that system of safeguards fails, will 

the new law help preserve evidence, punish criminals and protect victims?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. PASS/FAIL (Minimum Standard 

To Pass): Did the conference adopt and pass the Senate-passed Sarbanes-Leahy bill 

with no weakening amendments? Did the conference reject the Oxley-Gramm/accountant-proposed 

package to:<br>

&middot; Eviscerate reforms that would make audits more accurate and independent;<br>

&middot; Gut the standard-setting and enforcement powers of the new auditor oversight 

board;<br>

&middot; Shield dishonest auditors from accountability to their victims, by, among 

other things, eliminating the lengthened statute of limitations for securities 

fraud; and<br>

&middot; Eliminate the strong whistleblower and anti-shredding protections in 

the<br>

Senate bill?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">QUESTION A: Worth 60 Points, 

Anything Less is a Failing Grade. (See consumer/public interest group letter of 

22 July 2002 for detailed analysis of the gutting amendment package).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B. Additional Questions 

(4 X 10 Points Each): Did the conference improve the Senate bill to restore provisions 

deleted in committee or add provisions not considered on the floor?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) Improve Auditor Independence 

by strengthening the ban on non-audit services and requiring periodic rotation 

of audit firms, thus minimizing their financial incentives to turn a blind eye 

to accounting irregularities.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) Strengthen the Oversight 

Board by requiring a super-majority of public members subject to meaningful independence 

requirements, thus helping protect it from capture by the industry, and by improving 

the transparency of disciplinary proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) Restore Aiding And Abetting 

Liability (Shelby/LaFalce). Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen, and its lawyers, 

Vinson &amp; Elkins, are arguing to courts that they cannot be sued in shareholder 

lawsuits since they only &quot;aided and abetted&quot; Enron's fraud and are not 

primary perpetrators. To ensure victims of fraud can recover their losses, the 

law must overturn the Supreme Court's 1994 Central Bank decision.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4) Require the Expensing 

of Stock Options (Levin-McCain). Congress should eliminate the perverse incentives 

our accounting rules provide to offer incentive compensation in the form of stock 

options rather than grants of company shares, which would more closely align executives' 

interests with those of average shareholders.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EXTRA CREDIT: Add Baker 

Provision To Return Investor Funds. Use funds from fines and disgorgement of ill-gotten 

gains to provide restitution to investors who have lost money in the markets as 

a result of corporate malfeasance.</font></p>
