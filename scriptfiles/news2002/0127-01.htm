- January 27 - Sept. 11 victim's families returning

from a 9-day visit to Afghanistan will hold a press

conference on Monday, January 28 at 10 a.m. at 777

United Nations Plaza, 12th Floor (corner of 1st and

44th, entrance on 44th). </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They will speak about their cathartic meetings with

Afghans who lost family members in the recent U.S.

bombing campaign and their visits with hospital

workers, relief agency officials, and internally

displaced refugees. They will also call for the

establishment of a compensation fund for Afghan

victims of the U.S .bombing campaign, similar to the

fund that was set up for Americans whose family

members were killed in the attacks of Sept. 11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We&#146;ve met with people who have lost loved ones to the

U.S. bombing  We have looked at pictures of their

families, they have looked at pictures of ours, we

have talked with them, we feel the same grief,&quot; said

Kelly 

Campbell, whose brother-in-law Craig Amundson was

killed in the Pentagon attack, in an interview from

Afghanistan with Agence France Presse. &quot;The United

States government needs to take responsibility

for the direct effect on these people's lives,&quot; she

added. &quot;We owe it to them to do what we can to help

them rebuild their homes and give their children

health care and an education so they can get on with

their 

lives.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Monetary compensation can never erase the sorrow of

loss. But establishing a compensation fund would

represent a significant step toward building the bonds

of friendship that are the true foundations of peace,&quot;

said Medea Benjamin, founding director of Global

Exchange, the group that organized the trip. &quot;Whether

one supported the bombing or not, shouldn&#146;t our hearts </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and helping hands go out to those people who were

every bit as innocent as the victims of the September

11 attack?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The delegation to Afghanistan included four Americans

whose family members were victims of the Sept. 11

attacks:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rita Lasar is a 70-year-old retired small

businesswoman from New York City. Rita lost her

brother, Abe Zelmanowitz, at the World Trade Center.

Abe was on the 27th floor of 1 World Trade Center when

the first plane 

hit. Although he could have gotten out of the

building, he chose instead to stay with his friend, a quadriplegic who could not get out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kelly Campbell is a 29-year-old environmental campaign coordinator in Oakland California. Her brother-in-law, 28 year-old Craig Amundson, was killed in the Pentagon attack, leaving behind a young wife and two small children. Kelly is traveling on behalf of Craig&#146;s widow, Amber Amundson, who has been an outspoken voice for reconciliation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eva Rupp is a 28-year-old woman who works in

Washington, DC at the Department of Commerces National

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Eva is the

step-sister of Deora Bodley, and the two of them were

close from the time Deora was five.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Derrill Bodley is a 56-year-old professor of music at Sacramento City College and the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. Derrill lost his daughter, Deora, on United Airlines Flight 93, which 

crashed in Pennsylvania.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before he left for Afghanistan, Derrill Bodley said:

&quot;For me, this trip is about respect and love for all

human beings by all human beings, regardless of where

they come from. I&#146;m going on this journey to show my 

concern for those innocent Afghans who have died or

are suffering now. By embracing our common humanity

and sharing our sorrow perhaps we will be able to

avoid other loss in the future.&quot; While in Afghanistan,

Bodley met and cried with a man who had also lost his 

daughter in the aftermath of Sept. 11a man whose

5-year-old daughter was killed by a U.S. bomb.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also participating in the press conference will be

Masuda Sultan, a young Afghan-American woman who lost

19 members of her extended family when the US bombed 

their farm outside Kandahar just over a month ago.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although a full accounting of civilians killed during

the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan has not yet occurred,

two studies of civilian casualties put the number at

between 1,000 and 4,000 people. The studies were 

conducted by the Center for Defense Alternatives

(<a href="http://www.comw.org/pda/" target="_new">http://www.comw.org/pda/</a>) and by a University of New

Hampshire Economics Professor (<a href="http://pubpages.unh.edu/%7Emwherold" target="_new">http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold</a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The victims-to-victims delegation was organized by

Global Exchange, an international human rights

organization whose motto is &quot;building people-to-people

ties.&quot; Global Exchange say the journey had a profound

impact in both countries by showing that individual

Afghans and Americans suffer alike. Afghans saw that

U.S. citizens do care about their well being. The U.S.

visitors gained a deeper understanding of Afghans as

real people. And people around the world who learned

of the exchange through the extensive press coverage

it 

received witnessed the common humanity of all persons.

The press conference of the delegation participants is co-sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Visuals: Footage from the trip to Afghanistan will be

screened at the conference.
