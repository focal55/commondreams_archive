Author of &quot;The Terrorism Trap&quot; and &quot;Democracy For the Few,&quot; 
Parenti said today: &quot;July 4th celebrates that moment in history, over 225 
years ago, when American colonials launched a revolutionary fight for independence 
from the British empire. In their campaign they were assisted by people from various 
countries. Today all over the world peoples are struggling for independence from 
the power of global corporatism. Let's celebrate this July 4 with an expression 
of support and solidarity for people who want to use their land, labor, natural 
resources, and markets for self-development and popular well-being rather than 
for the enrichment of the powerful few.&quot;</font> </p>

Author of the article &quot;I Pledge Allegiance&quot; and the book &quot;To Die 
For: The Paradox of American Patriotism,&quot; O'Leary is associate professor 
of history at California State University at Monterey Bay. &quot;The recent Pledge 
of Allegiance decision is important because it begins a debate: should we have 
children reciting a loyalty oath every morning, instilling values through rote 
memorization? Of course, there's nothing sacrosanct about the words 'under God,' 
they were not in the original, but were added during the Cold War to show that 
we are a God-fearing country. In fact, the original was written by a Christian 
socialist, Francis Bellamy.&quot;</font></p>

Coauthor of the recent article &quot;Patriotism's Secret History&quot; and professor 
of politics at Occidental College, Dreier said today: &quot;Bellamy's view that 
unbridled capitalism, materialism and individualism betrayed America's promise 
was shared by many American radicals and progressive reformers who proudly asserted 
their patriotism. To them, America stood for basic democratic values -- economic 
and social equality, mass participation in politics, free speech and civil liberties, 
elimination of the second-class citizenship of women and racial minorities, a 
welcome mat for the world's oppressed people. Much of our patriotic culture was 
created by artists and writers of decidedly left-wing and even socialist sympathies, 
including 'America the Beautiful,' 'This Land Is Your Land,' 'Ballad for Americans' 
and the words on the Statue of Liberty.&quot;</font></p>

Author of the book &quot;Writing Dissent&quot; and the article &quot;Saying Goodbye 
to Patriotism,&quot; Jensen is associate professor at the University of Texas 
at Austin. He said today: &quot;Most people on the Fourth of July ask questions 
about how to express their patriotism. A better question is, Should people be 
patriotic? What does it mean to claim loyalty to a nation-state? These are not 
abstract, academic questions. Given that the United States has at its disposal 
the most destructive military capacity in human history and leaders willing to 
use it to advance the interests of power over people, we might ask: Can a moral 
person be patriotic? That question should dominate discussion on the Fourth of 
July.&quot;</font></p>
