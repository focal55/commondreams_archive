- July 25 - &quot;Today the Sierra Club applauds Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) 

and John Warner (R-VA) for introducing a new bipartisan bill to protect some of 

America's last wild forests. The Roadless Area Conservation Act would protect 

58.5 million acres of our National Forests' last pristine wild areas.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Americans deserve this strong bill to protect forests from the Tongass 

in Alaska to Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. These increasingly scarce unspoiled 

places are crucial for providing quality hunting and fishing, for protecting watersheds 

that supply clean drinking water, for offering magnificent scenery and providing 

backcountry recreation, for our families, for our future.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Since taking office, the Bush administration has whittled away at the 

core of wild forest protections, ignoring overwhelming public support. Today's 

introduction of the Roadless Area Conservation Act in the Senate, together with 

the companion bill in the House, will help ensure that the millions of Americans 

who support protecting our forests will be heard. The administration has voiced 

support for forest protection while consistently working to undermine it, planning 

to move forward with dozens of timber sales and other destructive projects in 

wild roadless forests. The Roadless Area Conservation Act turns forest protection 

rhetoric into reality.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Roadless Area Conservation Act also makes economic sense. Already 

more than half of our National Forests have been logged and scarred by 440,000 

miles of roads. With an $8.4 billion maintenance backlog on the current road system, 

it makes no sense for the Forest Service to waste taxpayer funds building new 

logging roads.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Last year Americans celebrated when the most extensive public comment 

process in history culminated in protections for the last wild areas in our National 

Forests. Today we applaud the many Senators and forest advocates around the country 

who have maintained steadfast support to bring protection to these special places.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Without the protections offered by the Roadless Area Conservation Act, 

our last wild forests are at risk of being devastated by logging and other damaging 

activities. Right now many destructive logging and oil and gas drilling projects 

are threatening wild forests in Alaska's Tongass Rainforest and the lower 48. 

These projects destroy wildlife habitat, imperil plant and animal species, and 

jeopardize the ability of our children and grandchildren to enjoy these wild places 

as we do.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Sierra Club urges all Senators to support the Roadless Area Conservation 

Act and work to pass this important legislation.&quot;</font></p>
