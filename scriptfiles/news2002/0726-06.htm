YORK - July 26 - The NGO Coalition for the International Criminal Court (ICC) 

condemed this week's passage of the anti-ICC American Servicemembers' Protection 

Act (ASPA) by the United States House and Senate on Wednesday, July 24th, as part 

of a broader supplemental appropriations defense bill for use in the &quot;war 

on terror.&quot; It is expected that the bill, which authorizes the military invasion 

of ICC headquarters in the Netherlands, will be signed by President Bush before 

the August recess.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This Congressional 

action is part of a multi-pronged effort of the US government to undermine international 

justice, international law and international peacekeeping,&quot; stated William 

R. Pace, Convenor of the global Coalition for the International Criminal Court. 

Pace added, &quot;As an American, I am ashamed of the lies and hypocrisy of the 

US government towards the ICC, and the disastrous reversal of US leadership on 

international law and justice during the new Bush Administration.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This March, officials in 

the Bush Administration began an offensive against the international justice system 

by attacking the UN tribunals prosecuting war crimes committed in Yugoslavia and 

Rwanda, urging that their mandate be shifted to a condensed time frame. On May 

6th, 2002, the Bush Administration announced in a policy address and letter to 

UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that it did not consider itself bound by the United 

States' signature of the Court's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, which occurred 

during the Clinton presidency. Simultaneously, the Bush administration began an 

anti-ICC campaign in the United Nations Security Council and in capitols around 

the world, where it continues to seek bilateral non-cooperation agreements exempting 

its citizens from the possibility of ICC prosecution.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the UN Security Council, 

the US government threatened to shut down UN peacekeeping operations worldwide 

unless all those involved in UN operations were provided with immunity from prosecution 

by the Court. On June 30th, the US vetoed the renewal of the UN peacekeeping mission 

in Bosnia-Herzegovina, heightening the sense of urgency around its demands. UN 

Secretary-General Kofi Annan responded by sending a letter to US Secretary of 

State Colin Powell, characterizing the US proposal as an irresponsible threat 

to peacekeeping and the legitimacy of the Security Council that &quot;fl(ew) in 

the face of international treaty law.&quot; On July 12th, after two weeks of contentious 

negotiations, the Security Council succumbed to US pressure and unanimously approved 

a weakened version of the proposal, granting nationals of non-State parties exemption, 

from the jurisdiction of the Court for one year when engaged in UN authorized 

or sanctioned operations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The passage of ASPA entrenches 

the US offensive at the national level through aggressive anti-ICC provisions, 

including the use of military force to free US nationals and citizens of allied 

countries detained by the Court, and the withdrawal of military assistance from 

some non-NATO States Parties to the Rome Statute. The legislation furthermore 

maintains that peacekeeping operations must exempt U.S. Armed Forces from criminal 

prosecution by the ICC and prohibits U.S. Armed Forces from engaging in peacekeeping 

missions unless there is a presidential waiver. According to William Pace, this 

legislation, &quot;like the Security Council resolution proposed by the US, includes 

language, such as authorization of an invasion of the Netherlands, that is illegal 

in terms of international law, US Atlantic Alliance and NATO treaties.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The severity and questionable 

constitutionality of earlier ASPA drafts submitted by Senator Helms and Congressman 

DeLay were modified in part through the incorporation of broad presidential waivers 

that, if used, could render the legislation null and void. Unlike earlier versions 

of ASPA, the adopted legislation also permits the US government to cooperate with 

international efforts to bring to justice war criminals, citing by name Saddam 

Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic and Osama bin Laden. Senator Dodd, who submitted this 

provision, stated that the law gives the President, &quot;the discretion to cooperate 

with any and all international efforts to bring such criminals to justice, including 

to the ICC.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ICC, the jurisdiction 

of which was established by the July 1st entry into force of the Rome Statute, 

will be the first permanent, independent judicial body capable of trying individuals 

accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Court, which 

is being set up and paid for by the nations that ratify the Rome Statute -- 76 

to date -- nand which already has an advance team operating in The Hague, is expected 

to begin hearing cases by mid-2003. </font>
