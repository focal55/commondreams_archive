- May 8 - Members of Congress today 

announced a proposal to overturn the Bush administration's recent 

assault on laws that protect the nation's waters -- specifically, 

the adoption last Friday by EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 

of a new rule to allow the Corps to permit wastes to fill and 

destroy streams, rivers, wetlands and other waterways. 

Reps. Chris Shays (R-Conn.), Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.), 

and a bipartisan group of House members announced at a Capitol Hill 

press conference that they will introduce legislation to counteract 

this destructive rule change. Earthjustice supports the 

legislation and expressed its appreciation for the Representatives' 

efforts to protect water quality. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nothing is more inconsistent with the Clean Water Act than 

allowing the nation's waterways to be filled and destroyed by 

industrial wastes -- yet that is precisely what the Bush 

administration's new regulation is intended to permit,&quot; said Joan 

Mulhern, senior legislative counsel for Earthjustice. &quot;While we 

believe the Clean Water Act and its regulations already prohibit 

the obliteration of the country's precious water resources in the 

manner promoted by the Bush administration, this legislation will 

overturn the new rule and make it even clearer that dumping coal 

mining waste and other masses of waste into waters violates the 

law.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We greatly appreciate the efforts of all of the Representatives 

who are supporting this legislation for their leadership in 

protecting our nation's waters from attempts by the coal industry 

and the Bush administration to undermine our environmental laws,&quot; 

said Mulhern. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legislation announced today would amend the Clean Water Act 

to enact into law the key portion of a regulation, first adopted in 

1977, that prohibits the Corps from permitting industries -- 

including coal mining companies -- from filling waters with waste 

material. It is this 'waste exclusion' that the EPA and Corps 

removed from long-standing clean water regulations with the new 

rule they adopted last Friday. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Earthjustice, the Bush administration rushed 

through the regulatory process late last week to finalize this rule 

change in an attempt to minimize Congressional and public scrutiny. 

&quot;The Office of Management and Budget, which supposedly gives close 

scrutiny to new regulations, officially received and then signed 

off on this major Clean Water Act rule in about 36 hours. 

Ordinarily, that is a process that takes at least a month, often 

much longer,&quot; said Mulhern. &quot;That says something about the 

administration's urge to finalize this rule.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The bipartisan opposition to this waste dumping rule is 

significant and has been growing as Representatives and Senators 

have learned about the threat it poses to waters in their 

districts,&quot; added Mulhern. &quot;I think that worried the 

administration.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;While this rule change was motivated by the administration's 

desire to legalize the illegal waste dumping practices of the coal 

companies that engage in mountaintop removal mining, its effects 

will be nationwide,&quot; Mulhern said. &quot;All streams, wetlands, rivers, 

and lakes in the country will be placed at risk of becoming a 

dumping ground for coal and hardrock mining wastes, construction 

debris, plastic refuse, and other wastes. Every member of Congress 

and every member of the public concerned about clean water should 

take a stand against this destructive change in water protection 

rules.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In March, a dozen senior House Republicans, led by Shays, wrote 

to President Bush, urging him to reconsider &quot;this ill-advised and dangerous 

rulemaking&quot; to allow waste disposal in waters. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They were joined on April 30 by fifty-seven Members of the House 

of Representatives, led by Pallone, who sent a letter to EPA Administrator 

Whitman conveying their &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the proposed rule. 

&quot;This rule change is a clear attempt to legalize the destructive practice of 

mountaintop removal coal mining, where coal companies literally blow the 

tops off of mountains and dump the waste into nearby valleys and streams,&quot; 

stated the letter. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 1, Sens. James Jeffords (I-Vt.) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) 

sent a letter to President Bush asking him to stop 

immediately his administration's efforts to overturn this important 

Clean Water Act rule. The letter from the Environment and Public 

Works Committee Chair and the Wetlands Subcommittee Chair, 

respectively, stated, &quot;the proposed rule would jeopardize the 

health of the nation's streams, wetlands, lakes, rivers and other 

waters.&quot; </font></p>
