- January 4 - &#148;Democracy Now!, the

award-winning national radio show that was banned in 

August from the progressive Pacifica Radio Network

returns to the Pacifica airwaves on Monday, bringing 

to the general public the voices of some of the harshest 

critics of the &quot;war on terrorism.&quot;  </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On Monday, Goodman will be reunited on -air with former 

co-host Juan Gonzalez for the first time in a year, when 

Gonzalez resigned to found a national grassroots campaign 

to reclaim the Pacifica stations. Guests will include filmmaker 

Michael Moore.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Democracy Now! was banished from Pacifica as part of

the Pacifica Radio crisis, which many community radio

activists say was an attempted corporate takeover of

the only progressive radio network in the United

States. The crisis moved toward resolution last

month when three lawsuits against the Pacifica board of directors were settled, and the board of directors was reconstituted. The new board majority is determined to return the 50+ year old listener-sponsored network to its peace and social justice mission. One of the first moves of the new board was to vote at their first board meeting, a conference call on December 29, 

2001, to bring back Democracy Now!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Democracy Now! is the flagship national program of

the Pacifica Radio Network, and its host Amy Goodman has

won numerous journalism awards. But, as part of the

ongoing conflict within the Pacifica Radio Network,

Goodman was forced off the airwaves at most Pacifica

stations and joined the ranks of dozens of journalists

who were censored or banned by Pacifica.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy Now!'s host and producers were physically

and verbally harassed out of the studios of WBAI in New

York City when that station was &quot;re-programmed&quot; by

 Pacifica management and board leaders and subsequently

banned from four of the five Pacifica Radio stations: 

WBAI in New York, WPFW in Washington, DC,

KPFK in Los Angeles and KPFT in Houston. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But rather than stop producing the show, Democracy 

Now! has expanded. In addition to broadcasting on Pacifica Station KPFA in Berkeley, the program aired on community radio stations around the  country and has begun broadcasting a daily national TV show which airs on 

Free Speech TV--channel 9415 of dish network  (Satellite TV)-- and 

public access cable tv stations around the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the attacks of September 11, Democracy Now!

has provided some of the most incisive programming on

war and terrorism to be found anywhere on radio or

television. On December 10, 2001, Democracy Now! 

broke the news of a University of New Hampshire 

professor's study documenting that close to 4,000 

civilians have died in Afghanistan as a result of

the U.S. bombing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

Other recent guests on the show have included Ahmed

Rashid, Pakistani journalist and author of 'Taliban:

Militant Islam, Oil, and Fundamentalism in Central Asia', discussing the oil-slicked road to war in Afghanistan, Tahmeena Faryal, spokeswoman for Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA), Arundhati Roy, activist and author of The God of Small Things, Howard Zinn, Professor Emeritus of History at Boston University, author of A People's History of the United States, and Noam Chomsky, author and linguist at MIT. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goodman has a track-record for journalistic

excellence that includes the George Polk award, the Robert F. 

Kennedy Prize for International Reporting, the 

Columbia-DuPont Silver Baton, the Radio Television

News Director's Award, as well as honors from AP, UPI and

the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pacifica Radio has been embroiled in controversy

since1999, when the Network's managers shut down KPFA of Berkeley. That shut down caused the largest protests in Berkeley since the Vietnam War. In December 2000, Pacifica &quot;re-programmed&quot; its New York City station, WBAI, by firing and banning long-time programmers and eviscerating the station's progressive political programming. Last August, Pacifica suspended Amy Goodman and removed Democracy Now! from the Pacifica airwaves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But on December 12, 2001, it was announced that

plaintiffs who sued the Network reached a settlement with the Pacifica board of directors that could end years of strife at Pacifica. The settlement created a new interim board of directors that draws its members from Pacifica's local advisory boards, its current board majority, and its board minority. Now there is hope among Pacifica Radio activists that the crisis is coming to an end and they will have a chance to rebuild the progressive radio network. Among the issues yet to be resolved are the return of the fired and banned producers at network-wide and resolution of the news stringers strike against Pacifica Network News.</font></p>
