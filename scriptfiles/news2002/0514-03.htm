<p>The Digital Empowerment coalition, a bipartisan group of over 75 civil rights, public interest, education, health, religious, labor, women's, community development, and technology organizations, is working to preserve and strengthen the federal government's leadership in expanding opportunity in the Digital Age. This launch will be the first in a series of events across the nation supporting federal community technology programs. </p>

<p>When: 	Wednesday, May 15, 2002, 11 AM<br>

 <br>

Where: 	Senate Swamp -- Northeast front of the US Capitol, near the entrance

to the Senate's Chamber <br>

RAIN LOCATION - 236 Russell Senate Office Building<br>

	 <br>

Why:  	The Bush Administration's FY03 budget proposal calls for the

elimination of two critical federal programs that supply seed money for technology projects in low-income urban areas, rural areas, and Indian tribal lands.  </p>

<p>* Created in 1994, the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) has awarded 530 grants, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, totaling $192.5 million and leveraging $268 million in local matching funds that create innovative technology demonstration projects in the areas of high-tech employment skills, emergency services, telemedicine, disability accessibility, and education. <br>

* Since its establishment in 1999, the Community Technology Centers program

(CTC) has distributed 227 grants, totaling over $74 million dollars, to promote the development of model programs that demonstrate the educational effectiveness of technology in urban and rural areas and economically distressed communities. <br>
