<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - June 4 - World Wildlife Fund hailed 

Japan's decision today to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as a &quot;welcome 

and essential step&quot; towards turning the climate treaty into 

international law this year. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision by the Japanese Cabinet follows six months of 

internal debate and was taken in the face of opposition from 

influential sections of Japan's business community. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is a welcome and essential step that puts global 

responsibility above special interest appeals,&quot; said Jennifer 

Morgan, Director of WWF's Climate Change Program. &quot;As the largest 

industrial emitter of gases that cause global warming, the United 

States also needs to act responsibly and put in place strong 

domestic policies that meet or beat its Kyoto Protocol targets.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan is the fourth largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) -- 

a heat-trapping gas released by burning fossil fuels and the main 

cause of global warming -- after the United States, the European 

Union and Russia. For the Kyoto treaty to become international law, 

it must be ratified by at least 55 countries and by industrialized 

nations that emitted at least 55 percent of the industrialized 

world's CO2 in 1990. Although the United States has rejected Kyoto, 

the treaty will enter into force if, at a minimum, it is ratified 

by the EU, Russia, Japan and either Canada or Poland. The EU 

deposited its ratification instruments on May 31 in New York, while 

Russia's Cabinet supported ratification on April 11. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Japan's decision comes on the heels of a recent report by the 

Bush Administration in which the Administration concedes that human 

actions cause global warming. Despite recognition of the problem, 

the potential for wide-scale disaster and the availability of 

solutions, the Administration still has not put forward an 

effective solution. The United States' inaction on climate change 

stands in stark contrast to the building momentum among other 

nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and combat global warming. </font></p>
