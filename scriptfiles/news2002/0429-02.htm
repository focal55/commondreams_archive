- April 29 -  The Center for Public Integrity's groundbreaking investigative

reporting and analysis of special interest politics in state

legislatures continues with the publication of the Center's latest

book, <i>Capitol Offenders: How Private Interests Govern Our States</i>.

The book is being released in conjunction with "The Fourth Branch,"

a new Center study that reveals lobbyists spent at least $600

million impacting legislation in states across the country in 2000.

<p>Capitol Offenders and "The Fourth Branch" will be unveiled

during a National Press Club news conference in Washington on

Wednesday, May 1 at 9:30 a.m. Capitol Offenders author Diane

Renzulli and Center for Public Integrity Executive Director Charles

Lewis, along with Center writers and researchers, will be on hand

to discuss the ways personal financial concerns of lawmakers and

special interest lobbying mute the voices of average Americans.

<p>For "The Fourth Branch," the Center compiled a nationwide

database of all 36,959 special interests registered to hire

lobbyists in the states-a ratio of five lobbying entities for every

state legislator. The data is coded by industry and provides a

snapshot of special interest influence in each state. The insurance

industry boasts the most industry representation in the halls of

statehouses across the country with 2,269 businesses and

associations registered. Second is health services, followed by

education, local government and health professionals. The report

spotlights this searchable database and state-by-state analysis.

<p>Capitol Offenders, the culmination of five years of research

into state legislatures by the Center, finds that state legislators

themselves sometimes have as much interest in legislation as

"Fourth Branch" lobbyists. Lawmakers often have a personal

financial stake in the laws they write, vote on and champion on the

statehouse floor. Capitol Offenders examines some of the most

important issues confronting Americans today: from HMOs denying

care to sick policyholders to the decline in the quality of

America's schools. It examines the exploitation of the poor by

"legalized loan sharks" and state lotteries and the failure of

nursing homes to provide adequate care for the elderly.
