YORK - July 30 - In its first official act as a major new force to fight back 

against insurance industry mismanagement and abuse of consumers, Americans for 

Insurance Reform (AIR), a new coalition of over 70 consumer and public interest 

groups representing more than 50 million people, has asked insurance commissioners 

in all 50 states to end insurance industry price-gouging by instituting major 

new industry regulatory reforms. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The action comes as both the U.S. Senate and the Nevada legislature 

are each set to vote on horribly misguided and cruel legislation that targets 

the wrong culprit - injured patients - rather than insurance companies in an effort 

to lower insurance rates for certain doctors,&#8221; said AIR spokesperson Joanne 

Doroshow. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AIR has sent letters to each insurance commissioner stating, &#8220;We are 

appalled that insurers - whose own actions have created a &#8216;crisis&#8217; 

in insurance affordability and availability for everyone from doctors and trauma 

centers to homeowners and motorists - are blaming others for their own mismanagement.&#8221; 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter states, &#8220;In view of the excessive rate increases, price-gouging 

and tight underwriting that have hit certain lines of insurance this year, including 

the homeowners and medical malpractice lines, and recent reports about the questionable 

business and accounting practices of some insurers &#8230; Americans for Insurance 

Reform believes it is imperative that insurance regulators take immediate steps 

to impose a new regime of corporate responsibility and accountability on this 

industry whose business practices are wreaking havoc on the American economy.&#8221; 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The letter documents the fact that the current large rate hikes and strict 

underwriting restrictions are due to the insurance companies&#8217; economic cycle, 

which results from pricing errors of insurance companies. Similar crises occurred 

in the mid- 1970s and the mid-1980s. In each of these three so-called &#8220;hard 

markets,&#8221; insurers blamed others for their own mismanagement and proceeded 

to abuse consumers with excessive rates and legislative proposals intended to 

restrict consumers&#8217; legal rights. </font></p>

industry whose business practices are wreaking havoc on the American economy.&#8221; 

</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans for Insurance Reform is a coalition of state and national groups 

including the Consumer Federation of America, the National Women&#8217;s Health 

Network, U.S. PIRG, USAction, the Center for Justice &amp; Democracy, and state 

organizations from 24 states including Florida, Texas, New York, California, New 

Jersey, West Virginia and Ohio. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AIR&#8217;s letter asks state insurance commissioners to undertake 14 specific 

investigations, audits and reforms, including: </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* An immediate freeze on medical malpractice and homeowner rates; <br>

* A full investigation of the high profitability of the insurance industry during 

much of the 1990s, and the extent to which today&#8217;s rate increases are an 

attempt to recoup money that insurers lost in the stock market or in other poorly-performing 

assets; <br>

* Annual audits to determine whether companies are engaging in questionable accounting 

practices and whether their business and investment practices present unacceptable 

financial risks for insurance consumers and shareholders; <br>

* Regulation of the excessive prices being charged by insurers at this time; and 

<br>

* Communication to state legislators that the solution to prevent shock rate increases 

such as those we are now experiencing is insurance reform, not restrictions on 

people&#8217;s right to be compensated fully for their claims. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The American consumer is paying for the mismanagement of the insurers 

through sharply higher rates and tightened underwriting rules and limits on coverage,&#8221; 

says AIR in its letter. &#8220;Meanwhile, insurance executives are pointing their 

fingers everywhere but at their own actions. Consumers have had enough of the 

insurance industry blame game and the endless cycle and the periodic crises that 

accompany it. Remedies that do not specifically address the insurance industry&#8217;s 

mismanagement will fail to stop these wild price gyrations in the future, leaving 

America&#8217;s insurance consumers at risk every 10 to 15 years. </font></p>
