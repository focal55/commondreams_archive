- August 7 - A key political operative 

in the Bush presidential campaign -- and a continuing &quot;advance man&quot; 



for presidential forays into West Virginia -- is promoting 

outrageous pro-coal industry views aimed at weakening national air 

pollution standards for fine particulate soot. </font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The operative, John H. McCutcheon, is a &quot;senior policy advisor&quot; 

in the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy. The 

nonprofit Clean Air Trust today named him its &quot;Villain of the 

Month&quot; for August 2002. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McCutcheon, previously was the West Virginia coordinator for the 

Bush presidential campaign and a Bush elector in the Electoral 

College. Last month, McCutcheon sent official DOE comments to the 

Environmental Protection Agency. The comments included the 

astonishing assertion that a key component of fine particle soot is 

&quot;chemically benign.&quot; (Key medical experts we have checked with are 

sputtering at this contention, saying the claim is so &quot;spurious&quot; 

and &quot;ignorant&quot; that it barely warrants a response.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the process, McCutcheon appears to be using his position not 

only to protect the coal industry, but also to influence Bush 

Administration environmental policy to maintain the President's 

popularity in the coal-rich state of West Virginia. (1) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EPA is in the middle of reviewing the tougher and controversial 

national air quality standards for fine particle soot set by the 

Clinton Administration in 1997. EPA set much tougher standards in 

1997 after concluding that tens of thousands of people are dying 

prematurely each year from breathing fine particle soot. The coal 

and electric power industries were among the fiercest opponents of 

those standards, which will lead to a crackdown on coal-based 

emissions. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a prelude to reviewing the actual standards, EPA is currently 

reviewing the numerous scientific studies involving fine particle 

soot. EPA scientists have linked tiny sulfate particles -- which 

come from burning coal and other fossil fuels -- to hospital 

admissions for asthma attacks and other breathing problems. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McCutcheon assailed EPA's conclusions in formal comments to the 

agency on behalf of the Energy Department's Office of Fossil 

Energy. In a cover memo, McCutcheon called on EPA to conduct 

numerous additional studies. The detailed comments he forwarded 

asserted -- astonishingly -- that sulfate pollution is a 

&quot;chemically benign substance.&quot; As evidence of this, the submission 

notes that types of sulfates are contained in certain asthma and 

heart medications. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">McCutcheon's assertion that sulfate is benign may echo comments 

coming from coal-burning electric power companies (2), but it is 

certainly way out of the mainstream of scientific and medical 

opinion. Other medical experts point out that McCutcheon's 

assertion is really an apples-and-oranges comparison -- and that 

other potentially lethal substances such as arsenic and cyanide are 

sometimes used in medicines, but that doesn't mean they are safe to 

ingest alone. Hello -- has anyone ever heard of Botox? </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, McCutcheon's position may be less surprising when you 

realize he is a prominent figure in West Virginia coal and 

Republican circles. In 2000 he was named Presidential Candidate 

Bush's campaign coordinator and spokesman for West Virginia. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After using coal-based politics to help swing the pivotal state 

of West Virginia into the Bush camp, McCutcheon was put in his 

current job at DOE. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While in that job, McCutcheon continues to double as the 

President's &quot;advance man&quot; on political trips to West Virginia, 

including the one he made on the 4th of July. In a January 2002 

Bush trip to West Virginia, McCutcheon was part of a small group 

who met with the President, White House political strategist Karl 

Rove, and White House political director Ken Mehlman (author of the 

recently leaked White House strategy document that noted the 2004 

re-election strategy includes &quot;maintaining&quot; constituents interested 



in &quot;coal and steel.&quot;) It would appear that part of McCutcheon's 

job is to keep the West Virginia coal interests happy in order to 

keep West Virginia in the &quot;red&quot; column in 2004. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is clear that the coal industry views McCutcheon as one of 

its own: the industry-dominated National Coal Council celebrated 

his appointment to the Energy Department job by noting that &quot;the 

full team is now in place for fossil issues... Having the full 

fossil team in place in time for the debate on these (air 

pollution) issues is critical.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">------ 

(1) We have seen other instances in which Bush environmental 

policy appears to have been crafted for re-election purposes. For 

example, the administration overturned recommendations by career 

EPA officers and refused to allow California to sell reformulated 

gasoline without ethanol. Even though it would mean more smog and 

higher gas prices in California -- and even though the decision was 

opposed by the oil industry -- the decision was very popular in 

Iowa, which Bush hopes to win next time. Similarly, the 

administration banned oil drilling off the coast of Florida (but 

not California). And, of course, the entire Bush policy towards 

emissions from coal-burning electric utility plants -- which would 

lead to more coal mining in Appalachia and more coal burning 

overall -- is aimed at keeping such states as West Virginia, Ohio, 

Tennessee and Kentucky in the &quot;red&quot; column in 2004 even though it 

will lead to more pollution and global warming. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) The argument is strikingly similar to that used by an industry consultant 

who testified on behalf of a power company in Connecticut last fall. </font></p>
