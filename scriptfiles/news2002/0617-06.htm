<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 17 - Kim 
Gandy, President of the National Organization for Women, protested with Washington-area 
activists outside the Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 17, challenging members 
of the Senate Finance Committee to enact welfare reform with the best interests 
of poor women and their families in mind when the Senate's welfare bill goes in 
for a markup, as soon as Tuesday, June 18.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;While welfare &quot;reform&quot; 
has moved people off the rolls, it has failed miserably at moving people out of 
poverty and into self-sufficiency,&quot; Gandy said. &quot;It's high time the 
Senate catches on and passes the most family-friendly welfare bill this country 
has ever seen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This week, the Senate 
has the chance to pass a welfare reauthorization bill that will actually reduce 
poverty, rather than simply kick poor women and children off the rolls to prove 
superficial short-term success.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;A 2000 report from 
the Kellogg Foundation showed that nine out of 10 people in the U.S. think that 
families moving from welfare to work should have access to education and/or training 
for jobs that would allow them to be self-sufficient. Yet, less than one percent 
of Federal TANF funds were spent on education and training in 2000.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I challenge the Senate 
Finance Committee to enact legislation that truly helps women and their families 
become self-sufficient by providing the education, fair job opportunities and 
programs that support work, including child care and transportation, that are 
essential for lifting poor women and their families out of poverty.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;After all, rhetoric 
about encouraging self-sufficiency for poor families is empty unless poor families 
can have access to an education that will guarantee equal opportunities. TANF 
recipients are currently required to spend 30 hours per week in work or work activities. 
It's critical that time spent getting an education be counted toward TANF's mandatory 
work hours.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's time to end the 
welfare debate once and for all. The only way to end the vicious cycle of poverty 
and welfare reform debate is to enact fair legislation that will yield real results. 
Educational opportunities and work supports, like child care and transportation, 
are key to real reform. This isn't rocket science, it's common sense.&quot; </font></p>
