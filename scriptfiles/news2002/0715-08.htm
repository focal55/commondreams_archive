- July 15 -&nbsp; News Advisory: </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- The White House refuses 
to release their own report on UNFPA's work in China, and the President reportedly 
may reject the advice of his own fact-finding team as sources say domestic policy 
staff is weighing in on this International issue. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Bipartisan Members of 
Congress will release the findings report from a similar fact-finding trip conducted 
by the Members of the British Parliament and demand a meeting with the President 
to discuss the status of UNFPA </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Members of the House of 
Representatives will announce the findings of a report from a UK delegation sent 
to China to investigate the U.N. Population Fund's (UNFPA) work in China last 
April. They will also announce nearly 50 bipartisan Members of Congress have signed 
a letter demanding a meeting with President Bush to discuss the status of funding 
for UNFPA. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on allegations made 
by a single right-wing group, the Bush Administration also sent a U.S. team to 
China to investigate UNFPA's work there in early May. The team, headed by former 
U.S. Ambassador Bill Brown, returned in late May and submitted a report to the 
White House. Recent news reports indicate that the report not only came back squeaky 
clean, but reported that the work UNFPA conducts in China actually improves women's 
lives. There are also reports that the Administration has been stalling the release 
of the report because they are weighing various political consequences. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Bush requested 
$25 million for UNFPA in his FY02 budget request, Congress showed bipartisan support 
for UNFPA by appropriating $34 million for UNFPA in the FY02 Foreign Operations 
appropriations bill which the President signed into law in January, 2002, Secretary 
of State Colin Powell testified that UNFPA does &quot;invaluable work,&quot; and 
the United States Government, as part of its efforts to improve the health conditions 
of Afghan women, gave an additional $600,000 to UNFPA in November, 2001. </font></p>
