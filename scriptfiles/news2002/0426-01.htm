- April 26 - <i>Following is an

open letter from National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association

President Robert Dodge:

</i>

<p>Dear Fellow Journalist:

<p>The continuing scandal surrounding sexual abuse of children and

youths by Catholic priests is a complex story that troubles our

readers and viewers. And it has presented numerous challenges for

journalists. Much reporting has risen to the occasion and delivered

sophisticated and informed coverage on this complex, evolving

story.

<p>Unfortunately, much coverage still falls far short. At the

National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, we are concerned

about the integrity of this reporting because our mission within

the news industry is to foster fair and accurate coverage of the

gay and lesbian community. Reports in recent weeks have included

some of the most unfair and distorted portrayals of gay men in

decades, lacking balance and alternative voices.

<p>Recent reports about the American cardinals meeting with Pope

John Paul II, for example, once again quote Catholic Church

officials who cast gay men as emotionally disturbed, link our

community with pedophilia, and fail to include other credible

sources with opposing opinions.

<p>As journalists and leaders of NLGJA, we acknowledge our job to

report assertions by Catholic officials that the presence of gay

clergy has resulted in sexual abuse cases, as well as stated

beliefs that link pedophilia and gay men. However, if similar

statements were made about other minority and stigmatized groups,

reporters and editors would feel obliged to find sources to

challenge those allegations. NLGJA urges that the same professional

standards be applied to stories concerning gays and lesbians.

<p>Coverage of the cardinals' meeting offered a number of examples

of how we in the news media can do better.

<p>First, stories quote Bishop Wilton Gregory stating that gay men

are not "psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually"

fit to be priests. Should journalists let statements like that

about gay men stand unchallenged when they would not do so if

similar remarks were made about another minority group? Why was the

cardinal not challenged on this point, or attempts made to seek

credible sources and data to question that statement?

<p>Second, Cardinal Adam Maida said that behavioral scientists tell

the Church this is "a homosexual-type problem." Who are these

behavioral scientists? What are their credentials? If your

reporters quoted a source that linked low academic test scores to

race, all of us would expect them to ask these obligatory follow-up

questions.

<p>Additional reporting may have revealed that the Catholic Church

does not have a problem with pedophiles. Instead, it may be one of

ephebophiles, or individuals exclusively attracted to adolescents.

More reporting might have turned up Dr. Fred S. Berlin, associate

professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. In a statement

that offered substantial balance and context, Dr. Berlin recently

educated The New York Times readers that: "...We should make it

clear that homosexuals are no more risk to children than

heterosexuals. In terms of the bigger picture, there are every bit

as many heterosexual men giving into sexual temptation with female

adolescents."

<p>When news organizations cover instances of sexual abuse by

heterosexual adults against children of the opposite sex, they are

not cast as stories about sexual orientation. They are accurately

reported as crimes against children. Without including balancing

comment in the Catholic Church story, news organizations allow

themselves to be spun by church officials who appear more

interested in deflecting responsibility for these crimes.

<p>News coverage about the sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church

has done more to link gay men with pedophilia than any story in

decades. Without balance, expert inquiry and opposing views, such

charges can create long-lasting and inaccurate ideas that will

damage the lives of gay and lesbian people for decades. As

journalists we owe it to our readers and viewers to uphold a basic

practice of our profession: Get all sides of the story.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Robert Dodge

NLGJA President
