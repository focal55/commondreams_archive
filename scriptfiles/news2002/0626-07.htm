<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 26 - Public 
Citizen, New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) and the Center for Auto 
Safety today sued the Secretary of Transportation over a rule issued last month 
addressing tire pressure monitoring systems. The groups challenge the rule as 
arbitrary and capricious because it allows manufacturers to choose to install 
either an effective system or an inferior system. The inferior system, by the 
agency&#8217;s own admission, will fail to prevent numerous preventable accident 
fatalities and serious injuries.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The suit was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit 
in New York City.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Underinflated tires are associated with hundreds of deaths and serious injuries 
each year and also decrease fuel efficiency. In late 2000, following the Firestone 
tire tragedy, Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to issue a rule 
requiring vehicles to contain warning systems to alert drivers when a tire was 
significantly underinflated. The Secretary delegated that task to the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which issued a final rule on May 
30, 2002.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In both its proposed and final regulations, NHTSA identified two types of available 
monitoring systems &#8211; the direct system and the indirect system. As NHTSA 
explicitly recognized, the direct system is far superior; in contrast to the indirect 
system, it can detect a lower level of underinflation in every tire, on any road 
surface, as soon as the vehicle is turned on.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The indirect system, although for cars with anti-lock brakes is marginally 
less expensive to install, does not detect underinflation if all four tires or 
if two tires are underinflated, does not work on bumpy roads, and does not work 
until the vehicle has been driven for at least 10 minutes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NHTSA's analysis predicted that the direct system would save more lives and 
prevent more serious injuries than the indirect system. Yet, under pressure from 
the White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget, NHTSA weakened its final 
rule, allowing manufacturers to install either type of system in new vehicles 
indefinitely. In fact, the schedule for phasing in the warning system requirement 
in new cars will allow manufacturers to comply with the new regulation by using 
the inferior system almost exclusively for at least four years.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Knowing whether your tires are underinflated is so important and so basic. 
The right system for consumers is obvious,&quot; said Joan Claybrook, president 
of Public Citizen, a national consumer advocacy organization. &quot;By allowing 
manufacturers to install inferior monitoring systems, the government is derelict 
in its duty to protect the public, and the regulatory process is undermined.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As administrator of NHTSA in the late 1970s, Claybrook proposed that a tire 
monitoring safety system be adopted, but the idea was dropped by the Reagan administration.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;As the agency charged with making our cars and roads safer, NHTSA is 
supposed to put public safety, not industry interests, first,&quot; said NYPIRG 
legislative counsel Russ Haven. &quot;Now it's up to the federal court to direct 
NHTSA to comply with Congress's tire-safety law, born of the Ford Explorer-Firestone 
Tire debacle, to prevent avoidable deaths and injuries.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Added Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, &quot;Indirect 
tire pressure sensors are a second-rate solution to first-rate safety problems. 
American consumers deserve the best system to save lives, not the second-best 
system to save auto companies money.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lawsuit was initiated by filing a petition for review. Public Citizen, 
NYPIRG and the Center for Auto Safety are being represented by Allison Zieve of 
the Public Citizen Litigation Group. <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/PCvMinetaPetition.pdf" target="_new">Click
