<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New 
York/ San Juan/Port-au-Prince - July 1 - An international coalition of environmental 
groups announced today that they would make every effort to block the export of 
New York City trash to the Caribbean, a proposal suggested by Sanitation Commissioner 
John Doherty last week. The New York Times quoted Mr. Doherty as saying &quot;could 
we find an island and do something?&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Timothy Logan, Solid Waste Coordinator for New York City's Environmental Justice 
Alliance said &quot;Environmental Justice activists throughout NYC will stand 
firmly with our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean to oppose environmentally 
inequitable and unsustainable practices. We continue to pressure our own elected 
officials to embrace waste prevention, composting and recycling as the answer 
to reducing the impacts of our waste&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Organizations around the United States and the Caribbean began mobilizing against 
the project as soon as the announcement was made.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The countries of the Caribbean will not take kindly to garbage imperialism 
from the Big Apple,&quot; said Aldrin Calixte with COHPEDA in Haiti. COHPEDA waged 
a successful decade-long campaign to demand the removal of Philadelphia's incinerator 
ash dumped on a Haitian beach in the late 1980s. Ironically, that infamous ash 
is finally being returned to Pennsylvania this week after 15 years, at the same 
time that NYC announces its regressive idea to dump its trash on Caribbean Islands. 
According to Calixte, &quot;We must join forces against this plan to prevent the 
giants of this planet who continue to undermine the environmental space of others.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the case of Puerto Rico the proposal is another insult to an open 
injury,&quot; said Juan Rosario, coordinator of the Alliance for the Sustainable 
Management of our Residues in Puerto Rico. &quot;During the last sixty years USA 
government have bombed Vieques, destroying a beautiful municipal island and harming 
its citizens; have use our people as guinea pigs testing agent orange, malathion, 
thalidomide; have made experiment with gamma rays in our pristine rainforest and 
conducted a sterilization campaign on our sisters without their consent, among 
many abominable things. Now, showing that human stupidity and greed has no limits 
they are proposing to send us their garbage. We will not tolerate it, we won't 
become the dumpsite of NYC and will do anything it takes to stop it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The groups, including the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, GAIA, BAN, and 
EarthRights International in the U.S. and Alliance for the Sustainable Management 
of our Residues, and COHPEDA in the Caribbean, said they would resort to blocking 
shipments with civil disobedience if necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Sending waste abroad will come back to haunt anyone who tries it,&quot; 
said Kenny Bruno, Campaigns Coordinator for EarthRights International.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Hearing the idea to export waste at the same time that New York is actually 
cutting its recycling program is like going back in time,&quot; said GAIA campaigner 
Monica Wilson. GAIA is an international coalition with members in 55 countries 
working to promote responsible and just waste management systems. &quot;In the 
1980's other U.S. municipalities considered this option but rejected it as short-sighed 
and unjust. Instead they adopted serious waste reduction and recycling programs 
and are now diverting the majority of their municipal discards back into the useful 
economy. When is New York going to join the 21st Century and embrace real solutions?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Is the memory of New York so short that they don't recall the Islip Garbage 
Barge that in 1987 plied the waters of the Caribbean and Eastern seaboard for 
months looking for a community willing to be dumped on?&quot; said Jim Puckett 
of the Basel Action Network (BAN), a global watchdog network that works to halt 
international dumping of wastes. &quot;At that time Greenpeace placed a large 
banner on the barge which stated: 'Next Time, Try Recycling.' Apparently New York 
remains deaf to this clear and compelling message.&quot;</font></p>
