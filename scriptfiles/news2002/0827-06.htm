<p><i><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powerful people within 

the U.N. believe in a strange idea: that multinational corporations, like super-rich 

Peace Corps volunteers, are going to save the planet out of the goodness of their 

hearts. Kenny Bruno and Josh Karliner bury this dangerous fantasy with name naming, 

muckraking research. This isn't just an expos&eacute;, it's a scathing obituary 

for the dominant development model of our time. <br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SAN FRANCISCO / JOHANNESBURG 

- August 27 - An energy company plants trees and donates electric cars to advertise 

its environmental commitment while polluting the air with coal-fired power plants 

for three-quarters of its energy. Hypocrisy? No, business as usual for many corporations, 

according to Earthsummit.biz, the latest from Food First Books and CorpWatch, 

published to coincide with the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Framed between the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the World 

Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, Earthsummit.biz, 

written by Kenny Bruno and Joshua Karliner, investigates how corporations, in 

partnership with the United Nations, champion environmental sustainability and 

human rights while hiding their polluting and exploitative practices with sophisticated 

campaigns touting concern for a sustainable future.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;At a time when corporations can&#8217;t be trusted to regulate themselves, 

the U.N. Earth Summit in Johannesburg is asking for just that: calling on the 

polluters to be their partners and voluntarily solve the planet&#8217;s most pressing 

environmental problems,&#8221; said Joshua Karliner, co-author of the book and 

director of CorpWatch. &#8220;This book exposes how the U.N. has cozied up with 

big corporations and stresses the need for greater corporate accountability, not 

only in financial matters but for environmental protection as well.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earthsummit.biz analyzes case studies of corporate green- and bluewashing campaigns, 

such as an oil company that boasts of its solar energy program but invests most 

of its money in oil exploration, the &#8220;environmentally responsible&#8221; 

car from a leading manufacturer of gas-guzzling SUVs, and a tobacco company that 

spends more on advertising its commitment to charitable programs than on the programs 

themselves. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Most corporations, when left to their own devices, are attracted to 

irresponsible behavior like moths to a flame,&#8221; said co-author Kenny Bruno. 

&#8220;The same hands-off, deregulatory approach that has led to so much corporate 

crime, bankruptcy, and economic turmoil is also giving global corporations some 

of the most environmentally destructive entities in the world a free ride while 

fostering greater ecological turmoil across the planet.&#8221;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earthsummit.biz advocates greater democratic control over corporations through 

international campaigns and the formation of a &#8220;Citizen&#8217;s Compact,&#8221; 

a network of NGOs, community, labor, indigenous groups, and professional associations 

dedicated to ensuring that human rights come before corporate rights. </font></p>

after the success of Diet for a Small Planet, is a policy think tank that carries 

out research and education for action. Food First works to identify the root causes 

of hunger and poverty in the United States and around the world, and to educate 

the public as well as policymakers about these problems and alternative solutions
