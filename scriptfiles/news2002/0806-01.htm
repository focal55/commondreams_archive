- August 6 - </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SCOTT RITTER, <a href="mailto:wsritter@aol.com">wsritter@aol.com</a><br>

Ritter, who was a chief UN weapons inspector in Iraq, is available for limited 

interviews. When asked by the Institute for Public Accuracy if he would be willing 

to go to Iraq with members of Congress, Ritter said he would consider such an 

option. He said today: "The offer by Iraq for members of Congress to go to Iraq 

is a positive one. Certainly, Congress doesn't do inspections, but there should 

be a dialogue between members of Congress and the Iraqis. The U.S. government 

response highlights the fact that it isn't interested in disarmament; it openly 

states that ousting Saddam Hussein is more important than ensuring that Iraq does 

not have weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqis are making it clear they want 

to play ball. The U.S. is currently president of the UN Security Council; but 

rather than pursuing the proposals from Iraq, it has sabotaged them...." (On CNN 

on Sunday, former UNSCOM head Richard Butler claimed: "When they [the Iraqis] 

threw UNSCOM out, we furnished a final report..." But Ritter said today: "UNSCOM 

was not thrown out in the end, rather Butler withdrew it to make way for the bombing 

campaign Desert Fox.") Ritter is the author of "Endgame: Solving the Iraqi Problem 

Once and For All." </font>

A widely noted historian who has authored numerous books including "A People's 

History of the United States" and the recent "Terrorism and War," Zinn was a bombardier 

during World War II. He said today: "The administration talks about hitting 'military 

targets' but that phrase is so loose that President Truman, after an atomic bomb 

obliterated the population of Hiroshima, said: 'The world will note that the first 

atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.'.... The bombs that were 

dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not forestall an invasion of Japan, because 

no invasion was necessary. The Japanese were on the verge of surrender, and American 

military leaders knew that.... The administration is now planning for a massive 

bombing campaign on Iraq and we know that this will mean that more Iraqi children, 

women and men will die...." </font>
