<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON - April 25 - Energy legislation set 

to receive final approval by the Senate could lead to an 

environmentally-damaging compromise with the House, which passed 

its version of energy legislation last summer, warned Defenders of 

Wildlife. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Based on the raw materials the House and Senate conferees have 

to work with, we cannot see how Congress could produce the kind of 

energy policy that America wants, needs or deserves," said Rodger 

Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife. "Senate energy 

legislation began as a promising vehicle for meeting our nation's 

energy needs, but has been commandeered by special interests and 

severely weakened by amendments," Schlickeisen added. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Defenders of Wildlife, a responsible energy policy 

should reduce consumption of oil by at least one million barrels a 

day; guarantee that at least 10 percent of electricity supplies 

come from new, clean renewable energy sources; cut subsidies to 

polluting energy sources; ensure a reliable and consumer-friendly 

electric system; reduce pollution to our air, land and water; and 

safeguard the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other public 

lands. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through a series of amendments, the current Senate bill has been 

stripped of provisions that would have significantly reduced our 

nation's dependence on oil, promoted clean, renewable energy or cut 

subsidies to dirty energy supplies. Specifically, the Senate has 

adopted amendments gutting proposed fuel efficiency increases, 

watering down provisions to promote the use of renewable energy and 

extending a dangerous liability limit for new nuclear power 

reactors. In areas including fuel efficiency, drinking water 

protection and hydropower, the bill actually rolls back current 

environmental protections. The bill weakens current law by 

exempting pickup trucks from any future increases in fuel economy 

standards. Regarding drinking and ground water contamination, the 

bill effectively overturns a Circuit Court decision that upheld the 

EPA's authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing -- a dangerous 

practice whereby chemical solvents are injected under high pressure 

into the ground to increase the yield of oil and gas wells. As for 

hydropower, the bill reduces or eliminates environmental 

considerations when licensing or relicensing hydroelectric power 

facilities. Without full consideration of environmental impacts 

and implementation of minimum controls, hydropower can kill fish, 

prevent fish passage, and degrade water quality. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite serious environmental problems, the Senate energy bill 

differs in a number of respects from energy legislation passed by 

the House in August, 2001. Most significantly, the Senate bill 

does not change current law and allow drilling in the Arctic 

National Wildlife Refuge, one of the nation's wildest and most 

important wildlife refuges. The Senate bill also includes tax 

provisions that place modest emphasis on conservation and renewable 

energy and establishes a renewable portfolio standard to promote 

the expanded use of clean alternatives to fossil fuels. Besides 

authorizing drilling in the Arctic refuge, the House bill gives the 

Secretary of the Interior expanded discretion to eliminate critical 

protections used to safeguard wildlife and other environmental 

values on public lands when there is an "unwarranted denial or 

restriction" to an oil and gas lease; eliminates or waters down 

current wildlife and wildland protections by placing burdensome 

requirements on agencies, such as justifying "restrictions" on oil 

and gas leases when they differ from state laws or regulations; 

creates a presumption in favor of leasing rather than reflecting 

that public lands should be protected and managed for all of their 

multiple use values; and eliminates the Forest Service's ability to 

protect sensitive resources and values on National Forests from 

harmful oil and gas leasing and development. 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Perhaps the most encouraging news is that there are plenty of 

contentious issues to frustrate House and Senate negotiators 

attempting to craft a compromise bill that Congress can approve," 

Defenders' Schlickeisen stated. "In our view, the American public 

would be better served if Congress went back to the drawing board 

rather than approving flawed final legislation that undermines 

protection of our lands and waters while failing to significantly 

reduce our dependence on oil," Schlickeisen added.
