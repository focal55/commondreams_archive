<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">RAMLE, ISRAEL      

- May 21 - Nauman Zaidi and Robert O'Neill, U.S. nationals illegally held in Masiyahu prison, were notified today by the prison warden that they had been expelled from the University of California for their humanitarian efforts in Palestine. Both students were part of a group who took food and medical assistance to the beleaguered Palestinians and clergy in the Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem earlier this month. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two activists were studying under an &quot;Education Abroad&quot; program, and have been in Cairo for the past year. The university's action against them means that all their study have been in vain, as they will not be able to transfer their work back to the U.S. Both would have graduated this summer. Today they were given 48 hours to oppose the expulsion order and to protest the abuse of their right to an education; as they are in prison, they are unable to take any action. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The expulsion of Zaidi and O'Neill continues a disturbing pattern of  ill-treatment of American activists in Israel and Palestine by U.S. institutions. In an attempt to remove all witnesses of its violent strikes against Palestinian communities, the Israeli government has deported nearly all of the peace workers who attempted to deliver or succeeded in delivering humanitarian aid to the Church of the Nativity during the 39-day standoff that ended May 10. While the embassies of other countries' peace workers intervened immediately to have their citizens released, several U.S. nationals continue to be held in Ramle prison, which is notorious for human rights abuses - especially against women and children.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Activists with the International Solidarity Movement, a Palestinian-led network of individual activists and grassroots community organizations dedicated to the nonviolent struggle for Palestinian freedom, have participated in a number of nonviolent direct actions in the occupied territories since May 2001.</font>
