Associate professor of politics and chair of the Peace and Justice Studies Program 
at the University of San Francisco, Zunes is the Middle East editor at the Foreign 
Policy in Focus Project. He said today: "It is remarkable how President Bush insists 
on democratic governance and an end to violence and corruption as a prerequisite 
for Palestinian self-determination when his administration, as well as many administrations 
before him, have strongly supported a series of violent, corrupt and autocratic 
regimes throughout the Middle East and beyond. It should be apparent that Bush's 
criticisms of Arafat's regime, however valid, are not the reason for denying the 
Palestinians their right to self-determination. They are the excuse."</p> </font>

Director of the Shalom Center, Rabbi Waskow was one of the initiators of an inter-religious 
call for U.S. action for peace in the Middle East that appeared in the <i>New 
York Times</i> on May 31. He said today: "Both Israel and the Palestinians need 
a clear vision of the American goal, not a fuzzy one, and a clear timetable. So 
do Americans, for this war besmirches all religious hope, and endangers all peoples."</p>

Boyle is professor of international law at the University of Illinois College 
of Law. He was legal advisor to the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East 
peace negotiations from 1991 to 1993 and author of the forthcoming book <i>Palestine, 
Palestinians and International Law</i>. He said today: "At least President Arafat 
was democratically elected by the vast majority of his people, unlike President 
Bush. The time frames seem deliberately designed by the Bush administration to 
punt on all critical issues beyond the 2004 presidential elections.... As Israel 
repudiates Oslo and resumes its outright occupation of the West Bank, there is 
nothing for the Palestinians but vague promises of good intentions by the United 
States government that have never materialized during the past 35 years. Basically, 
Bush gave Sharon the proverbial green light to dump Arafat. Violence will continue 
and escalate."</p> </font>

Naseer Aruri is professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts 
Dartmouth. He is author of the book <i>The Obstruction Of Peace: The U.S., Israel 
and the Palestinians</i>. He said today: "Bush's long-awaited speech will give 
Sharon most of what he needs to put into effect his colonial plan for the remaining 
part of Palestine -- absolute Israeli control, cantonization and economic strangulation 
among other methods of subtle persuasion to leave the country. The speech certainly 
endorses Sharon's position that Arafat must be overthrown, and that is now being 
made a condition for establishing a 'provisional Palestinian state,' a rather 
innocuous phrase that has no real meaning in either politics or international 
law. The speech was a major disappointment to all those around the world who were 
looking forward to seeing an end to the Israeli siege of West Bank cities, most 
of which are now under occupation."</p></i></p> </font>
