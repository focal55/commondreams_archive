<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEW YORK  - June 7 - Best-selling novelist Myla Goldberg spoke out publicly against the Israeli Occupation this Friday, breaking the sound barrier for the first time.  In a rare, Democracy Now! interview, Goldberg spoke of the importance of questioning Israeli policy and voicing opposition, despite the threat of criticism. &#147;There needs to be room for discourse,&#148; she told Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman.  &#147;And there needs to be room for dissent, while acknowledging that the people who are dissenting are proud to be Jewish and don&#146;t have a problem with Israel per se, but their policies right now are terrible.&#148;</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goldberg published her debut novel, Bee Season, in May 2000.  The book has garnered glowing reviews and sold more than 50,000 copies, catapulting Goldberg into the top-league of American-Jewish writers.   </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Bee Season tells the story of a Jewish family that is torn apart when one of its members, 9-year-old Eliza Naumann, wins first prize in her school spelling bee.  Eliza&#146;s newfound talent transforms her from an unremarkable child, overshadowed by her older brother, into a spelling prodigy blessed with the gift of transcendence through language.  Goldberg has said that she did not intend to write a &#147;Jewish novel&#148;; but &quot;it's important to write what you know, so it was natural to make the family Jewish.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goldberg spoke briefly about Bee Season on Democracy Now!  But she devoted most of the discussion to the importance of speaking out against the Occupation, both as an artist and a Jewish-American.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Goldberg also performed on the program with the Galerkin Method, a band in which she plays the accordion. The Galerkin Method is performing this weekend in a concert of Jewish musicians against the Occupation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following is a partial transcript of the interview that Amy Goodman, host of the radio and television show Democracy Now!, did with novelist Myla Goldberg.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Amy Goodman:</b> Can you talk about your decision to speak out as a high-profile Jewish writer?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Myla Goldberg:</b> Basically I did a tour of 30 Jewish Community Centers across the country in fall when the hardcover had come out.  And what I encountered was a surprise for me, frankly.  I encountered the phenomenon that there is a sizable portion of the Jewish-American population that &#133; [has] a myopia that I had not expected to experience.  There was a certain centeredness on purely Jewish issues.  I was meeting people who only read Jewish books, who were only interested in Jewish culture and as a result their focus on political issues was accordingly very narrow.  And I was hearing people talking about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in these really one-sided terms that frankly shocked me very much, both in terms of their ignorance and in terms of their racism.  And I tried to talk a little bit about it when I was actually touring, but it&#146;s very difficult when you&#146;re trying to engage in a dialogue and then two-minutes later you have to talk about your book.  So I realized that this was something I was going to have to take home with me and work on afterwards on my own.&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Goodman:</b> Did you feel any nervousness about jeopardizing your best-selling status by speaking out on this very controversial issue?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Goldberg:</b>  Well, quite frankly this is the first time I&#146;ve really had the opportunity to speak out in any sort of public forum, which is an extremely exciting event for me.  But, I&#146;m not concerned.  I am who I am: I&#146;m the person who wrote that and I&#146;m also the person who has these beliefs, and I don&#146;t see a conflict there.  I think it&#146;s in fact important for people not to try to build walls between who they are and how they&#146;re perceived.  I think it only can be destructive.  I mean, people are going to think what they&#146;re going to think, and I&#146;m going to keep thinking what I&#146;m going to think, and hopefully we&#146;ll keep talking to each other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Goodman:</b> And what do you think has to be done at this point?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Goldberg:</b> I think that Americans everywhere &#133; they need to read more, you  know?  They have to read not just the e-mails that their Jewish friends send them, talking about how terrible it is that the Palestinians are putting their little children up on the front, ignoring the fact that there are settlements that the Jewish families with their little children are putting in the West Bank and Gaza.  They need to be more even-handed, and they need to be not-fearful. &#133; There needs to be room for discourse, and there needs to be room for dissent, while acknowledging that the people who are dissenting are proud to be Jewish and don&#146;t have a problem with Israel per se, but their policies right now are terrible.</font></p>
