- January 22 - Fifty-five people were arrested today on the steps of the U.S. Mission to 

the United Nations this morning as they called for a change in US foreign 

policy that would continue the legacy of peacemaking begun by Dr. Martin 

Luther King, Jr. In the spirit of King's anti-war stance, the men and women 

occupied the steps of the mission demanding an end to the war in 

Afghanistan and renouncing any expansion of the war.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tuesday's act of nonviolent civil disobedience was the culmination of a 

four-day series of presentations and training reflecting on the life of Dr. 

King.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Dr. King's dream of a just society has yet to be realized. As King said, 

'The greatest purveyor of violence is my own country,' said Ceylon Mooney 

of Memphis, TN, one of those arrested today. &quot;As I and many others have 

seen, this is still true, and our collective conscience calls us to 

confront not only the violence committed on behalf of Americans, but also 

the institutions committing those acts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Joining the group on Tuesday morning were Amber and Ryan Amundson, widow 

and brother of Craig Scott Amundson, who was killed on September 11 in the 

attack on the Pentagon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Bush has said that the 'war on terrorism' requires sacrifice from the 

American people. The nonviolent protest in front of the US Mission to the 

UN is really a frontline battle of the war on terrorism, and the people who were arrested are showing the sacrifices needed to lead to a true victory against all forms of terror,&quot; said Amundson.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The protest was sponsored by War Resisters League (<a href="http://www.warresisters.org" target="_new">www.warresisters.org</a>), Voices in the Wilderness (<a href="http://www.nonviolence.org/vitw/" target="_new">www.nonviolence.org/vitw/</a>) and Kairos Community/ALC.</font></p>
