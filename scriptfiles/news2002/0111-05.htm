<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Mr. Barclay:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that the four-day Aviation Issues Conference at the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel in Kona, Hawaii has concluded, we believe you owe the public full disclosure about how much each of your sponsoring organizations - which included several major airlines and their trade group, the Air Transport Association -- paid to host the conference, and names of the legislators and their staffs who attended.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The public ought to have this information because your organization makes clear that this event is intended to give various segments of the airline and related industries exceptional access to key federal and congressional policymakers.  The conference theme this year was &quot;The New World of Aviation Security,&quot; and your own registration form called it &quot;a rare opportunity . to meet with aviation leaders from both the Executive and Legislative branches of the U.S. government AND with elected officials ... in an informal debate format, over a multi-day meeting . These officials influence your day-to-day operations.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are making our request on this, the four-month anniversary of the terrible events of September 11.  Those events made vividly clear what is at stake when Congress and federal regulators make and implement public policy concerning aviation security.  Because the stakes are so high, we think it is vitally important for you to disclose the all the information we are requesting, including the total cost of the conference, and the names and titles of all federal and legislative employees who attended and whether they paid their own way or were guests of your sponsoring organizations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We look forward to your response to our request.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sincerely,<br>

            Scott Harshbarger</font></p>
