<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 25 -Over the course of four
days this June, more than 25 dedicated cyclists with "People
Pedaling Peace" made the 190-mile trek from Hampton, Va., to
Washington, D.C., to honor and remember victims of gun violence.
<p>A rally to celebrate their success took place at the finish line
on Tuesday, June 25 at the Upper Senate Park in the shadow of the
U.S. Capitol. The press conference featured remarks from Sandra
McSweeney, founding member of "People Pedaling Peace"; Mary Leigh
Blek, Million Mom March director, Heather Wrabetz, Columbine
survivor; Michael Barnes, president of the Brady Campaign to
Prevent Gun Violence united with the Million Mom March; Kellye
McIntosh, youth organizing manager of Alliance For Justice, and
other riders participating in the event.
<p>Sandra and her husband Mike McSweeney formed the "People
Pedaling Peace" bike ride last year after their 14-year-old
daughter, Stephanie, was shot and killed by a stray bullet as she
walked out of a Hampton roller rink in March of 2001. This year's
"People Pedaling Peace" ride raised money to build a new playground
in Stephanie's neighborhood so children can have a safe place to
play.
<p>"I wanted to come up with another way to bring awareness to the
horror of crime," said Sandra McSweeney about her decision to form
the ride. "We need to let people know that our kids are dying."
<p>Several other individuals affected by gun violence also made the
journey this year, including Elisha Encinias, a Columbine survivor
who narrowly escaped the two gunmen in her classroom that tragic
day in 1999 and Amber Hensley, who witnessed the deadly rampage at
Thurston high school in Springfield, Ore.
<p>Congressman Robert C. Scott, 3rd District, Va. was there to
honor the McSweeney's, the cyclists from his district, and all
victims of gun violence. His attendance not only showed support
for his constituents, but for all Americans who believe in
common-sense gun legislation.
<p>The "People Pedaling Peace" cyclists rode not only in honor of
the victims of gun violence, but they rode for stronger, more
sensible gun laws in America. They are calling for Congress to
strengthen the country's existing laws and support new ones, such
as legislation to close the gun show loophole.
<p>"I will be riding in memory of all those who lost their lives to
gun violence, including my son Matthew who was killed in 1994,"
said Mary Leigh Blek, Million Mom March director. "I am committed
to fight each and every day to strengthen the gun laws in this
country because I know they save lives."
