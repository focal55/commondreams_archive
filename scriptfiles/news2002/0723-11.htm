- July 23 - Mining expert Jim Kuipers from the <a href="http://www.csp2.org/" target="_new">Center 

for Science in Public Participation</a> testified before the House Resources Subcommittee 

on Energy and Mineral Resources today that taxpayers may have to pay as much as 

10 billion dollars to clean up polluted mine sites on public lands. Recent rule 

changes require the mining industry to ensure adequate funding for mine clean-ups 

before mining begins. In response to industry lobbying against these rules, the 

Bush Administration formed a task force that is likely to propose changes to allow 

ineffective &quot;corporate guarantees&quot; rather than real financial guarantees. 

This would make it much easier for mining companies to avoid financial responsibility 

for clean-ups and shift the costs to taxpayers. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At a time when the Enron and Worldcom scandals have rocked 

public confidence and demonstrated a need for much greater 

corporate accountability, why is the Bush Administration about to 

allow the mining industry to evade responsibility for paying to 

clean up toxic pollution from mines?&quot; Kuipers told the committee. 

&quot;Instead of proposing to weaken the regulations, the Bush 

Administration should enforce current regulations and seek new 

tools to ensure that polluters pay, not taxpayers.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under existing federal regulations, mining companies are 

required to purchase bonds or cash equivalents to cover the costs 

of environmental clean-ups from mining operations on public lands. 

The up-front bond purchases ensure that toxic pollution will be 

cleaned up and mutilated landscapes reclaimed when a company is 

unable or unwilling to pay. These financial guarantees are needed 

because the mining industry has left a trail of toxic 

contamination: 500,000 abandoned mines across the county; the 

pollution of 40 percent of Western watersheds; and nearly 30 mine 

sites currently on the EPA's Superfund National Priority List of 

the most contaminated sites in the nation. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Typically, a large mine site will disturb more than 10,000 acres 

of land. At many mines, acid drainage can result in the leaching of 

toxic and carcinogenic contaminants such as arsenic into water 

sources. The costs of addressing this pollution can climb above 

one hundred million dollars per mine. Mining companies have been 

underestimating the cost of the clean-ups, and have failed to 

provide adequate guarantees to ensure that the mines will be 

cleaned up. Kuipers estimates that mining companies in the U.S. 

have a potential gap of $10 billion in clean-up coverage. If the 

mining companies won't be able to pay for the clean-ups, taxpayers 

will have to pay. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, in the midst of corporate accountability scandals, the 

mining industry is seeking relief from the Bush Administration. It 

has asked the administration to eliminate the bond requirement and 

replace it with a worthless paper &quot;corporate guarantee&quot; without any 



financial resources attached to it. The only financial guarantee 

would be the taxpayer. The Environmental Protection Agency 

Superfund has already paid out more than $500 million to clean up 

mine sites. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mining industry claims there is a crisis in the availability 

of bonds. Prices have risen for legitimate financial guarantees, 

but it is reflective of the track record of the mining industry's 

underestimation of costs. The true crisis is the potential costs of 

repairing public lands from mining operations.
