- September 9 - Twenty-three human rights activists will report to federal prison 

on Tuesday, September 10. They were among 37 who went to trial in July for civil 

disobedience at the School of the Americas (renamed Western Hemisphere Institute 

for Security Cooperation) in Columbus, Georgia. The 37 were among 10,000 who gathered 

last November to call for the closure of the notorious school. The defendants 

peacefully crossed onto Ft. Benning, site of the school. Thirty-six of the defendants 

were convicted of trespass, with sentences ranging from six months probation to 

six months in federal prison and $5,000 in fines. Five reported to prison immediately 

following sentencing, and 23 will report on Tuesday.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judge G. Mallon Faircloth 

is known for giving the maximum sentence for a misdemeanor to nonviolent opponents 

of the SOA/WHISC. Seventy-one people have served a total of over forty years in 

prison for engaging in nonviolent resistance in a broad-based campaign to close 

the school. Last year 26 people were prosecuted, including <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0909-04.htm">Dorothy 

Hennessey</a>, an 88 year-old Franciscan nun who was sentenced to six months in 

federal prison.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;It&#8217;s ironic that at a time when the country is reflecting on how 

terrorism has impacted our lives, dedicated people who took direct action to stop 

terrorism throughout the Americas are on their way into prison,&#8221; said Sr. 

Dorothy Hennessey.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SOA/WHISC is a combat training school for Latin American soldiers. Its 

graduates are consistently involved in documented human rights atrocities. In 

1996 the Pentagon was forced to release training manuals used at the school that 

advocated the use of torture, extortion and execution. In December 2000 Congress 

authorized the WHISC to replace the SOA. The renaming of the school was widely 

viewed as an attempt to diffuse public criticism and to disassociate the school 

from its reputation. SOA Watch maintains that the underlying purpose of the school, 

to control the economic and political systems of Latin America by aiding and influencing 

Latin American militaries, remains the same.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The SOA is the terrorist training camp in our own backyard,&#8221; said 

Fr. Roy Bourgeois.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>SOA Watch works to stand in solidarity with people of Latin America, to 

change oppressive US foreign policy, and to close the SOA/WHISC.</i></font></p>
