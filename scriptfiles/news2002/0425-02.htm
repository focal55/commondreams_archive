<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON 

- April 25 - 

 People For the American 

Way joined with other members of the Free Expression Network and 

federal lawmakers today to mark the six-month anniversary of the 

USA-PATRIOT Act and to raise concerns about the law's impact on 

constitutional rights. The Free Expression Network released a 

statement detailing the law's constitutional failings as well as 

other recent government actions restricting debate, dissent and the 

free flow of information. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a nation, we need to stand up to terrorists,&quot; said PFAW 

President Ralph G. Neas. &quot;But we must also stand up for our 

Constitution and democratic principles. The USA-PATRIOT Act and 

other actions taken by the administration undermine our civil 

liberties and the constitutional system of checks and balances.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Congress, under pressure from the Department of Justice, took up 

anti-terrorism legislation just weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks. 

Attorney General John Ashcroft publicly warned Congress that delay 

in passing the law might leave the country &quot;susceptible&quot; to 

additional terrorist attacks. At the time, PFAW urged Congress not 

to rubber stamp Ashcroft's demands and to carefully consider how 

the new law would affect constitutional liberties (see 

www.pfaw.org/caphill/anti_terror.html). Though Congress 

did make some improvements to the attorney general's bill, the 

USA-PATRIOT act granted law enforcement officials sweeping new 

powers and failed to adequately protect civil liberties. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Obviously it was appropriate -- indeed, imperative -- for 

public officials to reevaluate and update intelligence and law 

enforcement policies in light of the Sept. 11 tragedies,&quot; said 

Larry Ottinger, a senior PFAW attorney. &quot;It was not appropriate, 

and in fact irresponsible for Congress and the president to approve 

a law that runs roughshod over constitutional rights. It is time 

now to reconsider whether we are striking the right balance between 

security and liberty.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other members of the Free Expression Network to sign on to the 

statement, which was released at a Capitol Hill press conference, 

include: American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, 

American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Privacy Information 

Clearinghouse, and the National Coalition Against Censorship. The
