- June 13 - The Environmental Protection Agency announced changes today to New 
Source Review (NSR) provisions in the Clean Air Act relaxing air pollution controls 
and allowing more pollution emissions that directly harm human health, according 
to Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR). </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Children may be hit the hardest,&quot; said Susan West Marmagas, M.P.H., 
Director of the Environment &amp; Health Program at PSR. &quot;Pound for pound, 
children breath more air than adults making them more susceptible to air pollution 
that is released from power plants.&quot; EPA's new NSR provisions will make it 
easier for utilities to upgrade and expand their coal-burning power plants, without 
upgrading their pollution controls at the same time. &quot;The Administration's 
actions today are only one in a long line of actions that advance the use of fossil 
fuels, increase the dependence on conventional power plants, and disregard the 
negative effects of this strategy on public health,&quot; said Karen Hopfl-Harris, 
Legislative Director of PSR. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Clean Air Act wasn't a cosmetic piece of legislation; people need 
this protection,&quot; said Robert K. Musil, Ph.D., M.P.H., Executive Director 
and CEO of PSR. &quot;Air pollution contributes to thousands of cases of asthma, 
respiratory illnesses, and even premature death each year. The Administration's 
actions today represent a give-away to industry and fly in the face of protecting 
public health.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This pollution emitted from power plants contaminates the air we breathe with 
deadly consequences. Health professionals have repeatedly expressed concern over 
the large number of individuals -- over 121 million -- who breathe and live in 
areas with unhealthy air. From the aggravation of respiratory disease, like asthma, 
to premature death, air pollution is claiming its toll on American lives. Even 
though the Clean Air Act has been in effect for 30 years, it is estimated that 
pollution from power plants shortens more than 30,000 lives annually. EPA's announcement 
today will move us backward in the struggle to improve the health of Americans 
nationwide. </font></p>
