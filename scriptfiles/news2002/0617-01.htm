/ BERKELEY / GENEVA - June 17 - Environmental groups and community organizations 
on six continents today took action against waste incineration, challenging their 
governments to put a stop to the deadly practice and move their communities towards 
sustainable waste systems. Protest assemblies, direct actions, public fora, cultural 
events, cavalcade, petition campaign and information drive are taking place in 
54 countries in a record manifestation of global</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">opposition to waste incineration. 
See <a href="http://www.no-burn.org/" target="_new">http://www.no-burn.org/</a> 
for events worldwide.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today&#8217;s actions coincide with the first day of the sixth Intergovernmental 
Negotiating Committee (INC 6) meeting on the Stockholm Convention on Persistent 
Organic Pollutants (POPs) in Geneva. The Treaty, signed by 151 countries, aims 
to eliminate the most persistent toxic substances known to science, including 
the cancer-causing dioxins and furans.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Convention identifies all waste incinerators, including cement kilns burning 
hazardous waste as a major source of dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls 
or PCBs, and recommends the use of substitute techniques to avoid the generation 
of these byproduct POPs. As reported by the United Nations Environment Program, 
incinerators are the source of 69% of dioxin emissions worldwide.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the Global Anti-Incinerator Alliance (GAIA), which is spearheading 
worldwide participation in this first ever global day of action against waste 
incineration, the objectives of the Stockholm Convention renders incineration 
as an untenable waste management option particularly for countries which have 
signed the treaty.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Governments must now ensure the development of safe and sustainable 
alternatives to incineration. By taking action today, we hope our governments 
will get the message loud and clear &#8211; incineration has no place in a sustainable 
future,&#8221; said GAIA Co-Coordinator Von Hernandez.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incineration emissions and ash residues have been implicated in the serious 
contamination of the environment, the food supply and even breast milk, and have 
been associated with a growing litany of health problems including various cancers, 
reproductive disorders, immune system dysfunction, and birth defects.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, incinerators destroy vast quantities of resources which could have 
been recycled and brought back into the productive economy, and represents a massive 
financial drain on local governments and communities who will end up paying for 
the operation and maintenance of expensive, imported technology.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>GAIA is a growing international 
alliance of over 265 groups in 60 countries. Formed in Johannesburg in December 
2000, the alliance seeks to phase out all forms of waste incineration and promote 
clean production, zero waste and sustainable discard management systems.</i></font></p>
