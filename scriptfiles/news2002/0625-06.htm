- June 25 - Trucks and trains each carrying 240 times the radioactive material 
released at Hiroshima could rumble through hundreds of U.S. communities if the 
Senate votes in the next few weeks to allow the Yucca Mountain project to go ahead, 
according to a new report released today.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The U.S. PIRG report-- &quot;Radioactive 
Roads and Rails: Hauling Nuclear Waste Through our Neighborhoods&quot; --details 
the Department of Energy's proposal for more than 100,000 truck shipments of highly 
radioactive waste from all across the country to Yucca Mountain, Nevada.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In &quot;Radioactive Roads 
and Rails,&quot; U.S. PIRG shows that 44 states could see 105,985 truck shipments 
or 18,243 rail shipments of highly radioactive waste over the course of 38 years. 
Shipments of nuclear waste would travel on interstate and local highways as well 
as mainline rail routes. Other waste shipments could be carried by barge over 
waterways like Lake Michigan, the Mississippi River, and the Atlantic and Pacific 
Oceans.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Commuters on our highways 
could find themselves stuck in traffic behind three and a half tons of nuclear 
waste,&quot; said U.S. PIRG Staff Attorney Pierre Sadik. &quot;Tens of thousands 
of shipments of highly radioactive waste over four decades is going to put too 
many people in harm's way.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nuclear waste is recognized 
as the most dangerous substance known to humankind. When initially removed from 
the reactor core, it delivers a lethal dose of radiation within seconds. The Department 
of Energy intends to ship the waste in transportation casks, but size and weight 
limitations make it impossible to build a transportation cask that does not &quot;leak&quot; 
some radiation. The DOE acknowledges that a truck carrying a nuclear waste cask 
will emit the equivalent of one chest x-ray per hour of radiation to those who 
are caught in traffic nearby.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In the best case scenario, 
these shipments are rolling x-ray machines,&quot; said Sadik. &quot;In the worst 
case scenario, these shipments are mobile Chernobyls.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to one DOE estimate, 
there will be as many as 310 accidents in the course of transporting this highly 
radioactive waste across the country. There have been at least eight reported 
nuclear waste transportation accidents in the U.S. involving radioactive contamination 
of transport vehicles, roads and rails. Emergency Medical Services officials have 
stated repeatedly that they do not have the training or equipment to properly 
respond to a severe nuclear waste accident - which could involve thousands of 
deaths and billions of dollars in property damage. Because of the potential for 
such horrendous accidents, several studies show that property values will decline 
for the millions of Americans who will live in the vicinity of the transportation 
routes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The DOE currently has no 
plans to take into account the additional dangers of transporting nuclear waste 
post-September 11th. The Yucca Mountain project involves the movement of nuclear 
waste from 131 more securable locations, over thousands of miles of roadway and 
rail lines that cannot be secured from attacks, creating an opportunity for sabotage 
in communities across America.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;At the end of the road, under this ill-conceived plan, the waste will 
be dumped at Yucca Mountain - a volcano on an aquifer in an earthquake zone,&quot; 
said Sadik. &quot;It's time for the Senate to say no to this dangerous transportation 
scheme and to stop the Yucca Mountain project.&quot;</font></p>
