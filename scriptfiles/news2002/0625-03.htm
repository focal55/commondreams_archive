- June 25 - On the eve of the G8 
Summit in Canada, the Global AIDS Alliance today issued a briefing 
which states that even though G8 leaders plan to meet with African 
leaders, the leaders of the wealthiest countries are effectively 
&quot;turning their backs&quot; on the AIDS crisis in impoverished countries. 
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Our briefing makes clear that, despite all their lofty 
rhetoric, the G7 leaders have already failed to keep promises made 
at the last Summit,&quot; stated co-author David Bryden, of the Global 
AIDS Alliance. &quot;Sadly, indications so far are that this year's 
Summit will not produce firm commitments to rapidly provide the 
Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria with the resources it 
needs.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report also cites access to generic AIDS medication and 
international debt as areas where G7 leaders performance has been 
&quot;woefully inadequate.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report is available 
online at <a href="http://www.globalaidsalliance.org/G7report.html" target="_new">http://www.globalaidsalliance.org/G7report.html</a> 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The briefing states President Bush is pursuing a unilateralist 
approach at the expense of cooperative, multilateral initiatives, 
when it comes to global AIDS program funding. Senator Richard 
Durbin recently called the Bush initiative on funding programs to 
prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV a &quot;shell-game.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Unless they change course and provide real leadership to 
confront global AIDS, promises of effective assistance will be 
nothing more than a cruel mockery of the hopes of millions of 
people with AIDS and their family members,&quot; the briefing states. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The briefing states that just as the G7 leaders are meeting in 
Canada, US representatives at the TRIPS Council in Geneva are 
supporting narrow, highly conditional language that would make it 
difficult if not impossible for exporting countries to get cheap 
generic drugs to countries that lack domestic manufacturing 
capacity. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On international debt, the briefing calls on the G7 leaders to support debt 
cancellation. The briefing notes, &quot;Progress was made by requiring that 100 
percent of future World Bank loans for AIDS programs be grant resources and by 
increasing to 20 percent the grant component of other loans to the poorest countries. 
Yet, the G7 Finance Ministers failed to take up calls to make the debt relief 
process more effective at relieving both old and new debts. Plus, the G7 has so 
far failed to remove the senseless requirement that countries agree to take on 
new IMF loans in order to qualify for debt relief.&quot; </font></p>
