- September 13 - All across Indian Country

the generation in power is turning over the reins of responsibility

to the next generation -- challenging the new leaders to develop

initiatives and solutions while continuing the work of their

predecessors.

<p>Thus it is that on September 18th, LaDonna Harris (Comanche) --

nationally known activist and advocate of Native American causes --

steps aside as Chief Executive Officer of Americans for Indian

Opportunity (AIO) and will pass the feather of leadership to Laura

Harris (Comanche) the current Executive Vice President, and her

daughter. Americans for Indian Opportunity is a national non-profit

organization that for 32 years has served as a catalyst enriching

the cultural, political and economic self-determination of

Indigenous peoples.

<p>Although LaDonna Harris will no longer administer the

organization, she will continue to play a critical role as the

President of the Board of Directors. She will spearhead AIO's

increased work on international issues that affect indigenous

peoples. "I will focus my attention on the birth of a transnational

network of emerging Indigenous leaders who will be full

participants in world affairs. Globalization must not become just

another form of colonization," says LaDonna.

<p>"By stepping down as CEO of the organization, LaDonna once again

is actively demonstrating and reaffirming her commitment to

empowering emerging leaders," says Eddie Tullis, AIO Board Vice

President and Chairman of the Poarch Band Creek Indians. "We are

proud of how she has grown the organization over the past three

decades, and we look forward to a new era with Laura at the helm."

<p>Over the past ten years, LaDonna, through AIO's award-winning

American Indian Ambasssadors Program, has taken the lead in

facilitating the transition of power to the next generation. The

Ambassadors Program is a two-year fellowship that cultivates the

skills of emerging Indian leaders, develops tribal values and

teaches contemporary global realities.

<p>Throughout her fifty-year career, LaDonna Harris has influenced

the agendas of the Native American, civil rights, feminist,

environmental and world peace movements. She is a remarkable

statesman and national leader who has enriched the lives of

thousands. A consistent and ardent advocate of tribal America, she

applies much of her energy to reinforcing and strengthening tribal

governments. In addition to founding AIO, LaDonna helped establish

the National Indian Housing Council and the Women's Political

Caucus. Her influence now reaches to the international community to

promote peace, as well. She was named U. S. Representative to the

OAS Inter-American Indigenous Institute, the U. S. Representative

to the United National Education, Science and Culture Organization

(UNESCO) and currently serves on the board of Women for Meaningful

Summits.

<p>Laura Harris, current Executive Vice President and successor to

LaDonna, has extensive experience working with advocacy, community

activist, and philanthropic organizations. She is a trained

facilitator and a frequent public speaker, and has worked on

presidential, senatorial, and state and local political campaigns.

Laura serves on the national board of the Center for Policy

Alternatives, the national Advisory Board for renewing Democracy

Through Interracial/Multicultural Community Building, and the

National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy. Laura is also the

elected treasurer of the Toyah Band of Comanches of New Mexico. In

1997, President Bill Clinton appointed Harris as a Senior

Consultant to the President's Initiative on Race.

<p>"Over the past ten years, we have watched Laura develop the

necessary expertise and skills she needs to take over this national

organization," adds Chairman Tullies, "first with her work as

Projects Director and then as Executive Vice President."

<p>"I am honored that the Board of Directors has confidence in my

ability to guide Americans for Indian Opportunity into the future,"

says Laura. "Today, Native peoples and tribal governments are

facing unparalleled challenges - economic, cultural and political.

I am fully committed to leading AIO in its effort two work with

Tribal America to face these challenges and to find culturally

based solutions that will ensure the health, well-being and

integrity of Native communities. Change is inevitable. As we have

done in the past, Indigenous peoples can use our ancient knowledge

to help us adapt to anything."

<p>On September 18, 2002, a prestigious host committee will honor

the lifetime achievements of LaDonna Harris and commemorate Laura

Harris's new leadership role with a gala celebration at the Omni

Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D. C. Proceeds from the event will

benefit AIO's international initiatives. For further information

call AIO 505-278-0579 or 505-867-0278 or AIO at the Hotel Monaco in

Washington D. C. at 202-628-7177.
