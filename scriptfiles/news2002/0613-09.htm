YORK - June 13 - The first two days of the loya jirga demonstrate the promise 
and pitfalls facing the delegates to the grand national assembly, Human Rights 
Watch said today. On Tuesday, delegates reported being subject to intimidation 
by warlords and surveillance by agents of the Afghan intelligence service. On 
Wednesday, despite this ominous atmosphere, the delegates debated Afghanistan&#8217;s 
future in full legislative session.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;There is a clear desire by the legitimate delegates to make the loya 
jirga work, to select a civilian government committed to peace and rebuilding,&#8221; 
said Saman Zia-Zarifi, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. &#8220;Both their 
hope and their fear are visible.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Tuesday, warlords not appointed to the assembly were allowed inside the 
tent where the loya jirga is in session, mingling with the delegates and threatening 
those who called for their exclusion or opposed their agenda. Several delegates, 
including some women, reported threats when they complained about the warlords&#8217; 
participation in the grand national assembly. Other delegates reported alarm at 
the heavy presence of agents from the Afghan Intelligence Service (Amniat-e Melli).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;After subverting the voting process in many regions of Afghanistan, 
the warlords are now trying to hijack the loya jirga itself,&#8221; said Zia-Zarifi. 
&#8220;If the warlords succeed in their nefarious quests the security of the Afghan 
people will be put squarely in the hands of those most likely to threaten it.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The loya jirga was delayed for one day during which U.S. special envoy Zalmay 
Khalilzad was instrumental in sidelining the former Afghan king, Zahir Shah. The 
king subsequently renounced any role in governing Afghanistan. Khalilzad&#8217;s 
active intervention was in stark contrast to the U.S. government&#8217;s failure 
to implement the Bonn agreement&#8217;s exclusion of warlords from the loya jirga.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Delegates, regardless of their political affiliations, expressed consternation 
at U.S. intrusiveness in undermining the popular former king. &#8220;It has created 
the perception among Afghans that the U.S. is preempting the loya jirga&#8217;s 
choice,&#8221; said Zia-Zarifi.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to delegates interviewed by Human Rights Watch, a number of the most 
prominent warlords gathered Monday night to divide power in the next government.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In response, several women delegates complained publicly about the presence 
of figures widely held responsible for Afghanistan&#8217;s devastating decade 
of civil war and ensuing atrocities.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The Bonn agreement was drafted to increase the involvement of legitimate 
representatives of Afghan civil society and to decrease the power of warlords,&#8221; 
explained Zia-Zarifi. &#8220;For the Bonn project to succeed, the international 
community must increase security, intensify human rights monitoring, and exclude 
the warlords from the loya jirga.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Candidates with a history of human rights abuses were to be excluded from the 
loya jirga under Article 14 of the procedures governing the loya jirga. It states 
that delegates &#8220;should not have been involved in &#8230; abuse of human 
rights, war crimes, looting of public property&#8230; and not have been involved 
indirectly or directly in the killing of innocent human beings.&#8221; However, 
Human Rights Watch is not aware of a single case in which this exclusion clause 
was used, despite the presence of some of Afghanistan&#8217;s most abusive warlords 
among the delegates.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A woman delegate, who asked to remain anonymous, told Human Rights Watch, &#8220;We 
are hostages of the people who destroyed Afghanistan. They [the warlords] are 
trying to hold us hostage to their power.&#8221; Consistent with reports from 
many others, the delegate went on to describe efforts to coerce delegates. &#8220;There 
are petitions being circulated and we are pressed to just sign them without reading 
them, to agree with what is being said about who should be a candidate or chairman 
or have positions in the government. But we aren&#8217;t given a chance to read 
these decisions, they just say &#8216;sign it.&#8217;&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same delegate told Human 
Rights Watch that as a result of a public complaint she had been threatened by 
men associated with one of the warlords: &#8220;They told me, &#8216;you either 
mend your ways or we will mend them for you.&#8217;&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other delegates said they were troubled by the intrusive presence of agents 
of the Afghan intelligence service and their obvious efforts to monitor the delegates&#8217; 
discussions. The intelligence service is widely believed to be dominated by the 
forces of the predominantly ethnic Tajik Shura-yi Nazar, a political group founded 
by former president Rabbani and the late Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud. 
This party currently holds the key cabinet posts of defense, interior, and foreign 
affairs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One delegate, an experienced Afghan journalist, told Human Rights Watch, &#8220;Amniat 
[the Afghan intelligence service] was checking people, overhearing conversations, 
looking into rooms. They were marching around with a camera, photographing people. 
There were also plainclothes security police with cameras. We recognized them 
from the old days [under Communist president Najibullah].&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another delegate said that the intelligence agents had received credentials 
granting them full access to all areas of the loya jirga compound, contrary to 
the delegates&#8217; expectations. Officials of the loya jirga confirmed this.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;There is an urgent need for the security forces to protect the delegates 
from outside intimidation,&#8221; said Zia-Zarifi. &#8220;The special commission 
of the loya jirga and the United Nations should immediately remove any partisan 
from the loya jirga area.&#8221;</font></p>
