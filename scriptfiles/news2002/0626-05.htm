<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NEW YORK - June 26 - The 
U.S. government is extending its campaign against the new International Criminal 
Court to peacekeeping efforts at the United Nations, Human Rights Watch said in 
a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/icc/usproposal.htm" target="_new">backgrounder</a> 
released today. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the U.N. Security Council, 
the Bush administration is pressing to exempt peacekeepers from the authority 
of the court. Ratified by sixty-nine states, the court treaty will enter into 
force on July 1. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;The U.S. is trying 
to get at this treaty through the back door,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, Executive 
Director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;It's using the Security Council as a battering 
ram, to attack an institution that dozens of countries regard as a fait accompli.&quot; 
</font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roth called on France, the United Kingdom, and other members of the Security 
Council to &quot;defend the integrity&quot; of the new court. He noted that the 
U.S. delegation's previous attempts to exempt peacekeepers in East Timor from 
the court's jurisdiction ended in failure. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Human Rights Watch backgrounder examines various proposals the United States 
has advanced at the Security Council to exempt U.N. peacekeepers from the jurisdiction 
of the International Criminal Court. It also analyzes the British-initiated agreement 
for international troops in Afghanistan (the ISAF agreement), which U.S. diplomats 
have cited to justify Washington's own efforts to obtain exemption. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday, June 18, U.S. diplomats presented 
two alternative proposals to exempt peacekeepers: the first text would apply only 
to peacekeepers deployed in Bosnia, while the second proposal would exempt peacekeepers 
in all U.N.-authorized or -mandated operations. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The U.S. failed to win ironclad guarantees insulating itself from the 
court when the treaty was negotiated, and now Washington is trying to achieve 
its goal through other means,&quot; said Roth. &quot;This puts the very idea of 
treaty-making at risk. Why negotiate a document if the U.S. can change it later, 
behind the closed doors of the Security Council?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The International Criminal Court will be the first-ever permanent international 
criminal court authorized to try those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity 
and war crimes when national courts conduct sham trials or fail to investigate 
at all. Beginning July 1, people accused of those crimes could be brought to trial 
before the court, which will be located in The Hague. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Clinton signed the Treaty on December 31, 2000. On May 6, 2002, the 
Bush Administration announced its intention to withdraw U.S. signature. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U.S. War Crimes Ambassador Pierre Prosper has said that President George Bush 
&quot;was not going to war&quot; against the International Criminal Court. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;What's happening at the United Nations right now looks to me like a full-scale 
assault on the court,&quot; said Roth. </font></p>
