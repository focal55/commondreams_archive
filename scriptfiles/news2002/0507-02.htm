- May 7 - Rainforest Action Network (RAN) floated a giant 120-foot dinosaur hot air balloon that proclaims, &#147;I LOVE DESTROYING OLD GROWTH,&#148; over Microsoft this morning. The dinosaur balloon is part of a national &#147;Dinosaur Tour&#148; to highlight the absurdity of destroying old growth forests and confront Boise&#146;s (NYSE: BCC), formerly Boise Cascade, local customers - Microsoft, Eddie Bauer, University of Washington and the state of Washington - about continuing business ties with America&#146;s most destructive logging company. Industry dinosaur Boise refuses to heed public sentiment in support of wilderness and old growth protection and end its barbaric practices of buying and selling products made from old growth, endangered forests and logging on U.S. public lands. Over the next six weeks, RAN will bring the dinosaur balloon to major cities across the country. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Dinosaur Tour is the latest move in RAN&#146;s hard-hitting campaign against Boise for refusing to end its obsolete logging and distribution practices and adopt sustainable forestry principles. The tour comes on the heels of a series of contract cancellations by some of Boise&#146;s most prominent customers including Levi-Strauss, Kinko&#146;s, L.L. Bean, University of Notre Dame and Patagonia. The campaign has made Boise the target of increasingly intense public criticism for failing to join more than 400 companies, including Home Depot, Lowe&#146;s, Kinko&#146;s in a pledge to stop selling products made from endangered, old growth forests. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Until Boise adapts its business practices to meet modern values, it will continue to lose customers and earn its title as the logging industry dinosaur,&#148; said Jennifer Krill, Old Growth Campaigner, RAN. &#147;Companies in business with Boise are in the business of old growth destruction, and America&#146;s biggest brands are making it clear that&#146;s a place they don&#146;t want to be.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There exists widespread public support for old growth forest preservation. According to the Los Angeles Times, 9 out of 10 Americans favor preserving our remaining wilderness. Last month, a poll by Davis and Hibbits showed that 70 percent of consumers in traditional timber regions such as Oregon and Washington favor an end to old growth logging. According to a poll by Yankelovich, two out of five consumers would boycott a company that contributed to old growth destruction. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;Protecting the world&#146;s old growth forests has become as American as baseball and apple pie,&#148; said Michael Brune, Campaigns Director, RAN. &#147;American consumers no longer tolerate the destruction of the world&#146;s remaining old growth forests, and that sentiment is dramatically affecting the market. Boise&#146;s choice is to either get out of old growth or go out of business.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Specifically, RAN is calling on Boise to end its international old growth trade, phase out logging operations on U.S. public lands, and embrace the ecologically and socially responsible principles of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boise actively logs forests on U.S. public lands, is one of America&#146;s largest distributor of wood products from endangered, old growth forests throughout Indonesia, Canada, Central and South America, and Russia, and has been linked to human rights abuses in Guerrero, Mexico. Last year, Boise led the charge against the popular U.S. Roadless Policy, a measure that would have protected 58.5 million acres of America&#146;s public wilderness areas and considered the most significant forest conservation measure of the last 100 years. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than three-quarters of the world's old growth forests have already been logged or degraded, much within the past three decades. In the United States, less than five percent of our original forests remain. </font></p>
