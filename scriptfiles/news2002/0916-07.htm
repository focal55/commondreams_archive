- September 16 - The Bush administration is stepping up its fight to block the 

release of information about its energy policy by bringing the solicitor general 

into the case. On Wednesday, Solicitor General Theodore Olson is expected to appear 

in federal district court to defend Vice President Cheney's continued efforts 

to keep secret the meetings of his so-called energy task force in a lawsuit brought 

by the General Accounting Office (GAO). Olson, who represented George W. Bush 

in his case against Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the 2000 

presidential election, is the number three official at the Justice Department. 

The solicitor general traditionally represents the government before the Supreme 

Court.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Having the Solicitor General appear in district court is unprecedented,&quot; 

said Sharon Buccino, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council 

(NRDC). NRDC brought one of the first cases against the Bush administration for 

failure to disclose information related to the energy task force. &quot;The Bush 

administration is pulling out all the stops to keep the public in the dark about 

its dubious energy dealings. But Olson's involvement only increases speculation 

about what the White House has to hide.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The administration is fighting three lawsuits in federal court over the energy 

task force records. While federal agencies have been forced to release some documents, 

the White House continues to withhold critical information. Court action ordering 

the release of the records could occur within the next month in two of the three 

cases. A summary of all of the legal proceedings against the administration is 

provided below.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walker v. Cheney, D.D.C. 02-0340 (JDB) For the first time in history, GAO sued 

the White House, asserting that it has the right under the statute providing for 

its existence and authority (Title 31 of the U.S. Code) to investigate the activities 

of the energy task force because the group received federal funds. Even though 

GAO believes that it has the right to deliberative documents, it agreed not to 

seek minutes of the task force meetings. The White House, however, still steadfastly 

refuses to provide even the most basic information about who the task force met 

with and when. The case is being heard by Judge John Bates, a new Bush appointee 

who was previously involved in the Whitewater investigation of former President 

Bill Clinton.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NRDC v. Department of Energy, D.D.C. 01-2545 (PLF) NRDC sued the Energy Department 

under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for records relating to the energy 

task force, including minutes of meetings that occurred. Although the Energy Department 

and other federal agencies have released some information about whom cabinet officials 

met with regarding energy policy, the White House has refused to provide similar 

information. NRDC has argued that the records of Andrew Lundquist, the task force 

executive director, and other key task force staff -- all of whom were Energy 

Department employees -- must be disclosed under FOIA. Briefing is complete and 

Judge Paul Friedman could issue a ruling any day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Judicial Watch v. National Energy Policy Development Group, D.D.C. 01-1530 

(EGS) Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club sued the Bush administration for violating 

the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which promotes open and balanced government 

decision-making. The administration tried to dismiss the case arguing that FACA 

did not apply to the energy task force. Judge Emmett Sullivan rejected this argument 

and held that discovery should proceed to establish the facts regarding who met 

with the task force and when. If outside parties (i.e., industry lobbyists) were 

regular participants in the task force, the administration may have run afoul 

of FACA's requirements for public access to the task force meetings and records. 

While federal agencies have released some information, the White House once again 

has refused to provide any of its records. A hearing on the administration's motion 

for protective order is scheduled for September 30.</font></p>
