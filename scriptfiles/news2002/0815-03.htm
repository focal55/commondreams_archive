<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BURLINGTON, 

VERMONT - August 15 - Congressman Bernard Sanders (I-VT), the Ranking Member of 

the International Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, today called for an 

immediate Congressional investigation of the recent $30 billion International 

Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout of Brazil. Sanders, who is strongly opposed to the 

bailout and considers it corporate welfare, wants Congress to find out why U.S. 

taxpayers are being asked to provide billions of dollars to Brazil and how much 

of this money will be funneled to U.S. banks such as Citigroup, FleetBoston and 

J.P. Morgan Chase. These banks have about $25.6 billion in outstanding loans to 

Brazilian borrowers. U.S. taxpayers currently fund the IMF through a $37 billion 

line of credit.</font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders said, &quot;At a time when 

we have a $6 trillion national debt, a growing federal deficit, and an increasing 

number of unmet social needs for our veterans, seniors, and children, it is unacceptable 

that billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars are being sent to the IMF to bailout Brazil. 

This money is not going to significantly help the poor people of that country. 

The real winners in this situation are the large, profitable U.S. banks such as 

Citigroup that have made billions of dollars in risky investments in Brazil and 

now want to make sure their investments are repaid. This bailout represents an 

egregious form of corporate welfare that must be put to an end. Interestingly, 

these banks have made substantial campaign contributions to both political parties.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders noted that the neo-liberal 

policies of the IMF developed in the 1980's pushing countries towards unfettered 

free trade, privatization, and slashing social safety nets has been a disaster 

for Latin America and has contributed to increased global poverty throughout the 

world. At the same time that Latin America countries such as Brazil and Argentina 

followed these neo-liberal dictates imposed by the IMF, from 1980-2000, per capita 

income in Latin America grew at only one-tenth the rate of the previous two decades.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders continued, &quot;The policies 

of the IMF over the past 20 years advocating unfettered free trade, privatizing 

industry, deregulation and slashing government investments in health, education, 

and pensions has been a complete failure for low income and middle class families 

in the developing world and in the United States. Clearly, these policies have 

only helped corporations in their constant search for the cheapest labor and weakest 

environmental regulations. Congress must work on a new global policy that protects 

workers, increases living standards and improves the environment.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sanders is the author of the Global 

Sustainable Development Resolution that among other things calls for the United 

States to condition funding for the IMF, the World Bank and other International 

Financial Institutions on support for labor rights, environmental protection, 

decent living standards, and support for small and medium-sized local enterprises.</font></p>
