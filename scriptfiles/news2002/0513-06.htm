- May 13 - Former Dominos Pizza CEO Tom Monaghan got an anti-gay initiative on the ballot this November in Ypsilanti, MI and he doesn't even live there.  The entire cost of this initiative, paid for by Monaghan was $6589.69, according to campaign documents released last week.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organization Ypsilanti Citizens Voting Yes for Equal Rights Not Special Rights was funded entirely by Monaghan and one other person, neither of which resides in Ypsilanti, according to their campaign finance statements for 2001.  Monaghan &quot;contributed&quot; $6589.69, and the other donation of only $19 was from a woman by the name of Judy Bloss, to open a post office box for the group.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the contribution by non-Ypsilanti residents, local volunteers collected only 26 of the 1100+ signatures.  According to documents released by The Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality, a local group supporting equal rights for all people, Tom Monaghan paid the entire cost to hire a professional petition circulator from California.  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ypsilanti residents were distressed first to learn that these people hired a professional business to collect signatures for this cruel measure, and we suspect people will be outraged to learn that this entire effort has been funded by people who don&#146;t even live in Ypsilanti,&quot; said Elizabeth Eddins, an Ypsilanti resident.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And although the anti-gay initiative was funded entirely by people outside of Ypsilanti, financial statements from the Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality shows that this organization, supporting equal rights for all people in Ypsilanti, raised $5956 in 2001, from 114 individuals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1998, Ypsilanti passed an inclusive non-discrimination ordinance that protects people based on a variety of characteristics, including religion, age, race and sexual orientation. This new charter amendment seeks to remove protections, but only for gay, lesbian and bisexual people. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This charter amendment is part of a well-funded effort around the state to legitimize discrimination against gay people,&quot; said Lisa Zuber, co-chair for the Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality (YCFE). Documents released Wednesday show that Monaghan, in addition to bankrolling the Ypsilanti anti-gay initiative, has given thousands of dollars to similar efforts in at least one other city. His contributions, along with the anti-gay American Family Association, helped run anti-gay campaigns in three Michigan cities last year. &quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These people were successful in putting this on the ballot for two reasons: 1) substantial funding and 2) deception,&quot; said Elizabeth Eddins. &quot;They create intentionally confusing ballot language, mislead people into putting it on the ballot, then refuse to talk about what the charter amendment would do, which is legalize discrimination against gay people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality needs help battling these people who can write big checks,&#148; adds Zuber. &quot;We can't raise this kind of money entirely inside Ypsilanti, but this campaign &shy; unlike theirs &shy; will be run by people who live in the town under attack.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;It is clear that this election would not be taking place without the paid petitioners and Tom Monaghan footing the bill,&quot; Zuber states. &quot;Discrimination against anyone is wrong, yet here they come essentially buying their agenda onto our ballot. That's shameful.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Ypsilanti Campaign for Equality is a group of local citizens working to prevent any changes of the city charter that will allow discrimination.</i></font></p>
