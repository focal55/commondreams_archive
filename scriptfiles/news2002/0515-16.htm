- May 15 - Health GAP, in response to the announcement today of Sen. Kerry and Sen. Frist's &quot;U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Act of 2002,&quot; released the following statement:</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;After two decades of neglect, Congress is finally preparing to roll up its sleeves and confront the global AIDS disaster. This progress is welcome, and long overdue,&quot;  said Asia Russell of Health GAP.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Kerry/Frist Bill would authorize a $1 billion increase in U.S. spending for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria in 2003. President Bush has requested a meager $200 million for the Global Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill also authorizes additional money for bilateral assistance programs for AIDS and other illnesses. The activists say the new funding for AIDS should prioritize low-cost life extending AIDS treatment. 95% of people with HIV in developing countries have no access to AIDS medicines. Every day 8,000 people with HIV in developing countries die because AIDS treatment, widely available in wealthy countries, is too expensive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The increased funding levels in the Kerry/Frist Bill show lawmakers are on the right path, and are heeding the demands of concerned people with AIDS,&quot; said Paul Davis of Health GAP.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, the United States will need to contribute far more to the Global Fund for 2004 than what is currently contained in this bill. After the Fall meeting of the Global Fund Board, we will have a better handle on how much is needed to fulfill our obligations. Until then, we hope that Senators Frist and Kerry will simply delete the inadequate number authorized for the Global Fund in 2004.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The $1.2 billion authorized for the Global Fund for 2004 is over $1 billion short of the $2.5 billion estimated to be needed for the Global Fund to cover the high-quality applications expected to be submitted through the summer. The Fund Board is expected to award another round of grants this September or November.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We applaud the comprehensive bill delivered by Senators Kerry and Frist. We hope the senators will go the full distance and authorize $2.5 billion for the Global Fund in 2004,&quot; continued Davis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We trust that appropriators will work closely with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to turn this authorizing bill into real money,&quot; stated Sharonann Lynch of Health GAP.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As the bill wends its way through the legislative process, short shrift must not be given to AIDS treatment,&quot; continued Lynch. Affordable AIDS treatment in developing countries is the most historically neglected component of bilateral programs addressing global AIDS. &quot;Now that lawmakers have agreed that billions are needed from the U.S. to win the battle against global AIDS, they must put provisions for affordable, life extending treatment front and center where they belong.&quot;</font></p>
