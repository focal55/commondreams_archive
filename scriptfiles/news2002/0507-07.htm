- May 7 - Following is a statement by 

Environmental Working Group (EWG) President Ken Cook: </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Conventionally grown food has significantly higher levels of 

pesticides, and is contaminated with residues of multiple 

pesticides, far more frequently than organic food. And those lower 

pesticide levels translate into lower risk of cancer and other 

health effects for consumers who eat organic food, particularly 

children. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;These are the key findings of the first detailed study 

comparing pesticide residues on tens of thousands of samples of 

organic and conventional foods. The study also found that farming 

methods designed to use pesticides more sparingly also result in 

food residue levels that are lower than in regular food. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;In recent years, the federal government has restricted or 

banned a number of pesticides out of a growing scientific 

recognition of the special risk these chemicals pose to children's 

health. This study makes clear that the entire food supply can and 

should move in the direction of lower pesticide residues and thus 

lower health risks. The organic food industry is leading the way 

with a safer alternative. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Consumers know what to eat if they want to cut back on fat, 

calories or cholesterol. Now they know they should buy organic if 

they want to reduce pesticides in the foods they eat and feed their 

children.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The study was published in the current (May, 2002) issue of Food 

Additives and Contaminants, a scientific journal. It was authored 

by Brian Baker, Charles Benbrook, Edward Groth and Karen Lutz 

Benbrook. </i></font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EWG, a nonprofit environmental research organization, has 

published dozens of studies on the risks of pesticides to children.</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font></p>
