<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 27 - In 
a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the Ohio law creating 
a private-school voucher program in Cleveland is constitutional. People For the 
American Way Foundation (PFAWF) President Ralph G. Neas voiced alarm at the Court&#8217;s 
ruling in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris. PFAWF served as co-counsel for the Ohio citizens 
who challenged the voucher law. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &quot;This decision represents 
a serious crack in the constitutional wall between church and state, and it&#8217;s 
especially troubling when part of that wall comes crumbling down on Cleveland&#8217;s 
public school children,&quot; said Neas. &quot;Cleveland and other urban school 
systems are in tough financial straits. Giving this voucher program a 'green light' 
only makes that situation worse.&quot; </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The narrow margin of this decision is a sobering reminder that so much 
will be at stake when the next Supreme Court vacancy occurs,&quot; Neas added. 
&quot;Predictably, Justices Scalia and Thomas were on the wrong side of this decision. 
If a like-minded justice were to join them on the Court, the integrity of the 
First Amendment's Establishment Clause would be in even more serious danger.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, legal concerns with vouchers are far from settled as many state 
constitutions set a higher standard for church-state separation. The next major 
legal challenge for vouchers is brewing in Florida, where a hearing is scheduled 
before a state court next month on the state&#8217;s voucher law. PFAWF is serving 
as co-counsel for a group of Florida residents challenging the law. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Supreme Court judged the voucher program to be constitutionally permissible, 
Neas said the American people have examined vouchers from a different perspective 
and come to their own conclusion. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The Court has said that states can legally create a voucher program like 
this, but why would they?&quot; he asked. &quot;Unlike smaller class sizes and 
other proven reforms, vouchers haven't demonstrated that they can improve student 
learning. And they reach only a handful of students while draining millions of 
dollars from public schools and undercutting real reform. It's no wonder that 
in every state where they've been put to a vote, vouchers have been soundly defeated.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michigan and California were the last two states in which voters, in November 
2000, rejected voucher initiatives by decisive margins. Exit polls showed these 
initiatives were opposed by voters across the lines of race, ethnicity and gender. 
African-American and Hispanic voters opposed the voucher initiatives by at least 
a 2-to-1 margin. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We know that the pro-voucher forces are likely to use this ruling to 
jump-start a new round of expensive campaigns to enact vouchers in various states,&quot; 
Neas continued. &quot;But we firmly believe the public remains opposed to vouchers, 
and we are prepared to fight these efforts, state by state.&quot; Click here for 
a review of state voucher referenda. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During this past school year, about 4,300 students took part in the Cleveland 
program that diverts public tax dollars to pay for tuition at participating private 
schools, virtually all of which are religious. In today&#8217;s ruling, the Court 
reversed a decision rendered by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had 
ruled that the Cleveland program violated the First Amendment to the Constitution.
