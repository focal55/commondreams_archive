<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON     - May 23 - The Alliance for Justice 

expressed its great disappointment over the decision on the part of a 

majority of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to send to the 

Senate floor the nomination of Judge D. Brooks Smith to the U.S. 

Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. &quot;We believe that a careful 

review of Judge Smith's record could produce only one conclusion,&quot; 

said Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron. &quot;We urge the full 

Senate to undertake that review.&quot; </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Responding to the Committee vote today, Aron warned, &quot;Our efforts 

to defeat Judge Smith's confirmation are not over. We expect that 

groups dedicated to gender equality will be especially energized for 

a floor fight, but his record is one that should alarm anyone 

committed to equal justice for all, who believes in a capable, fair, 

and independent judiciary.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aron noted that Judge Smith's record raises serious concerns in a 

number of different areas. He has been reversed more than fifty times 

by a relatively conservative 3rd Circuit in cases involving such 

critical issues as workers' rights, consumer safety, environmental 

protection, and gender discrimination. Many of these decisions 

demonstrate a tendency to favor powerful entities over the interests 

of ordinary Americans and a bias against some of the country's most 

vulnerable populations. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other aspects of his record raise further concerns about his 

commitment to gender equality, as well as his compliance with 

standards of judicial ethics. At his district court confirmation 

hearing in 1988, Smith promised the Senate that if he were confirmed, 

he would withdraw from an all-male club, unless he were able to 

persuade the club to change its discriminatory policy. Nonetheless, 

he remained in the club for eleven years, in contravention of the 

judicial code of ethics, and withdrew only after the appellate court 

seat to which he has now been nominated came open. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a speech before the Pittsburgh Chapter of the Federalist 

Society in 1993, Judge Smith strongly criticized the Biden-Hatch bill 

that became the Violence Against Women Act, arguing that Congress did 

not have the power under the Constitution to enact such protections. 

At his Feb. 26 confirmation hearing, Judiciary Committee senators 

focused on his attendance of and failure to properly report 

corporate-funded judicial seminars, as well as his failure to recuse 

himself promptly from a case involving a bank in which he had a 

substantial financial interest. </font></p>
