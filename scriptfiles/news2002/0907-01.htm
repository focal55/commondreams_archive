<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Dr. Schmidt and Mr. Barnett:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are writing to express our outrage at the Chinese government's reported 

blocking of access to Google and AltaVista. We strongly suspect that this blockage 

is related to China's recent widespread crackdown on the free flow of information 

over the Internet, and to its growing pressure on foreign companies to comply 

with state censorship. We urge your companies to continue to resist the Chinese 

government&acute;s censorship pressure as a violation of internationally recognized 

rights of free expression.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you know, search engines 

such as Google and AltaVista play a critical role in ensuring the free flow of 

information to millions of users in China. Chinese users who want to read objective 

news, and educate themselves on such restricted topics as human rights, Tibet, 

religion, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, often rely on your search engines. The Chinese 

government blocks access to thousands of web sites based on their content. Using 

Google and AltaVista remains one of the best ways to circumvent this censorship, 

since it permits searches that may turn up restricted information in unexpected 

locations that have not been blocked. We suspect it is just this formidable power 

that attracted the attention of Chinese government censors. Google&acute;s practice 

of keeping and permitting access to &#8220;cached&#8221; pages &#8211; which are 

accessible via Google even if direct access is blocked &#8211; may also have been 

a factor.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Companies that do business in China have an opportunity to play a proactive 

role in opening space for Chinese citizens to express themselves freely. Unfortunately, 

Yahoo!, along with a number of Chinese internet businesses and research institutes, 

has voluntarily signed a public pledge on &quot;self-discipline&quot; in China 

that commits the company to investigate and block websites based on their content. 

We believe that signatories to that pledge risk making themselves partners in 

violations of freedom of expression. If they are search engines, they also risk 

undermining the power and reputation of their product.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We strongly urge Google and AltaVista to continue to resist any censorship 

pressure from the Chinese government. In the past, Google has resisted pressure 

from interest groups to censor content, and we understand that AltaVista is making 

an effort to ensure that Chinese users continue to have access to its site despite 

the recent blockage. As you continue these commendable efforts, you will have 

the support of nongovernmental organizations, as well as allies in the U.S. government 

and the broader private sector. History has shown that coordinated action can 

be effective in forcing the Chinese government to back off from efforts to censor 

the Internet. When the Chinese government tried to clamp down on the commercial 

use of cryptography in October 1999, coordinated efforts by various companies 

and trade agencies forced the Chinese government to drop the requirement that 

encryption codes be turned over.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We see such censorship efforts as an emerging problem in China and elsewhere. 

We would greatly appreciate an opportunity to discuss this matter with you directly, 

and look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely,</font></p>
