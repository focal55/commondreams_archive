<LI>RUSSELL MOKHIBER,

<A HREF="mailto:russell@nationalpress.com">russell@nationalpress.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.corporatepredators.org" target="_new">www.corporatepredators.org</A><BR>

Editor of <i>Corporate Crime Reporter</i>, Mokhiber said today: "Henry Paulson, the chairman of Goldman Sachs, is quoted on the front page of <i>The New York Times</i> today:

'I cannot think of a time when business over all has been held in less repute.'

Why is that? Because corporate and white-collar crime inflict far more damage

on society today than all street crime combined. With a jury about to decide

whether Andersen will become the nation's most recent corporate criminal, it's

time to take stock." Mokhiber, who produced a list of the Top 100

Corporate Criminals of the 1990s, added: "Health care fraud alone costs

the nation more than $100 billion a year in damage, while, according to the

FBI, burglary and robbery inflict $4 billion. The FBI estimates that there are

15,000 homicides in the United States every year. Compare that to the more than

40,000 Americans who die every year on the job or from occupational diseases.

And yet, the prisons are filled with street criminals. In its March 18, 2002

cover story, <i>Fortune</i> magazine summed it up this way: 'It's time to stop

coddling white-collar crooks. Send them to jail.' ... The bandaid reforms being

put forth by the likes of Paulson and Securities and Exchange Commission chair

Harvey Pitt seek to shore up investor confidence, which is lagging badly, and

stave off irreparable damage to the market. But only fundamental structural

change in corporate form and regulation will get the job done, and few

Democrats or Republicans are serious about fundamental structural change."

bizethics@aol.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.business-ethics.com" target="_new">www.business-ethics.com</A><BR>

Editor and publisher of <i>Business Ethics Magazine</i> and author of the recently-released book <i>The Divine Right of Capital</i>, Kelly said today: "I'm heartened that the

head of Goldman Sachs is making these comments in public. Ethics has clearly

gotten lost in the rush for profits. But I think fundamental reforms are needed.

For example Ralph Estes has proposed that we have a corporate accountability

commission, which would audit companies and be funded by a tax on corporations.

We need to change the business of auditing in a fundamental way to ensure

genuine independence. It's very hard for someone to police your books when

you're the one hiring them. Another suggestion, put forward by the Project on

Government Oversight, is that companies with a history of law-breaking be

prohibited from government contracts."

<P><LI>PAMELA BUCY <BR>

Professor of law at the University of Alabama, Bucy is author of the book <i>White Collar Crime</i>. She has suggested in her writings that the civil False Claims Act, which

currently applies to government contracting, be expanded to other areas of law,

specifically securities and environmental law. She said today: "If we had

something like the False Claims Act applied to securities law, those Enron VPs

who wanted to blow the whistle would have had a mechanism."
