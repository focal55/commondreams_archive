<td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" width="530"><!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">WASHINGTON  - June 11 - Many bioethicists have financial ties to the companies whose ethics they evaluate,

presenting something of an ethics problem for a profession charged with scrutinizing controversial

practices in science and medicine, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest

(CSPI). Today CSPI urged more than 125 bioethics organizations and journals to address the

problem of conflicts of interest by disclosing consulting, advisory, and funding arrangements

bioethicists have with biotechnology, pharmaceutical, chemical, and other companies.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;This is a classic case of the fox guarding the henhouse,&#148;  CSPI executive director Michael

F. Jacobson said. &#147;I fear that professional ethicists may lose sight of right and wrong as they try to

make their opinions more palatable to corporate sponsors.&#148; 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSPI notes that:

</font>

<ul>

	

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics is developing a code of ethics for

the agricultural biotechnology industry. The effort is funded by Dow, DuPont, and

Monsanto, and industry officials serve on the committee developing the code.

	</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The University of Kansas&#146; Midwest Bioethics Center has created a Research Integrity

Project &#151; with $587,870 from the Aventis Pharmaceutical Foundation.

	</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Biomedical companies have given &#147;at least $2 million to bioethics centers and offered

lucrative contracts to academic researchers,&#148; according to U.S. News and World Report.

	</font>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American Medical Association&#146;s Council on Ethics and Judicial Affairs has a

program to educate doctors about the ethics of industry gift-giving. The program is

sponsored by, among others, Eli Lilly, Merck, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Bayer, and Procter and

Gamble, and company representatives sit on the working group.

</font>

</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSPI found that only one bioethics organization (the University of Pennsylvania&#146;s Center

forBioethics), out of 89 surveyed, has on its web site a policy on external funding and conflicts of

interest. Of 53 bioethics journals, only two have published requirements for disclosing conflicts of

interest to the journal and its readers.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;The problem with ethics consultants is that they look like watchdogs but can be used

like showdogs,&#148;  Carl Elliott, a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota said. &#147;No matter how

outrageous a corporate policy, no matter how troubling a headline in the morning paper, it will be

softened by the knowledge that the corporation in question has consulted with a team of ethics

experts.&#148; 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letters, from Virginia A. Sharpe, Ph.D., director of CSPI&#146;s Integrity in Science

Project, urge bioethicists to bring the same degree of scrutiny to their own conflicts of interest as

they have to those of doctors and clinical researchers.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;When members of the public hear someone speak as an ethicist they assume that the

person doing the talking is beyond reproach,&#148;  says Sharpe, herself a bioethicist and former

Deputy Director of the Hastings Center. &#147;Bioethicists and bioethics institutions have not been as

diligent as they should have been in ensuring that financial ties to industry do not inappropriately

influence their work.&#148; 



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CSPI&#146;s letter to bioethics journals urges them to require disclosure of all relevant

financial and other potentially biasing ties of authors and to reject those papers whose objectivity

is compromised by conflicts of interest. The letter to bioethics organizations calls for them to

develop and make publicly available strong policies to prevent conflicts of interest due to

corporate funding and other influences, to define the types of affiliation that are unacceptable,

and to establish procedures for managing unavoidable conflicts.



</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CSPI initiative is intended to sensitize bioethicists and the public to the pitfalls of

corporate-ethicist partnerships and to establish guidelines on the ethics of bioethics. CSPI

accepts no corporate or government funds. Information about industry-sponsored science can be
