- May 13 - Members of Physicians for 

Social Responsibility (PSR) applauded today's announcement by 

President Bush that he will co-sign a treaty with Russian President 

Putin to reduce U.S./Russian nuclear arsenals later this month. 

Although the finer details have not been released, the agreement 

will allow for some weapons to be stored, and possibly reactivated. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This agreement is an important step but we need to see the 

actual language of the treaty,&quot; said Robert K. Musil, PhD, MPH, 

executive director and CEO of Physicians for Social Responsibility. &quot;We are still concerned about placing U.S. nuclear weapons in 

storage instead of permanently putting them out of commission. And 

we are concerned that this treaty will be a footnote on the way to 

President Bush's long-sought flexible arsenal of useable 

war-fighting offensive and defensive nuclear weapons.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since Bush and Putin agreed in November in principle to 

reductions of up to 67 percent in current arsenals, Russia has 

pushed for a formal agreement that would codify formal cuts, while 

Bush has leaned toward an informal agreement with minimal 

restrictions. Negotiations have continued since then, and a 

compromise reached this week allowed for a formal treaty to be 

created, but preserved the Bush Administration's dangerous desire 

to be able to reverse arms cuts by re-deploying weapons. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The big question here is whether these nuclear weapons will be 

reserved to use another day, or taken permanently out of 

commission,&quot; said Musil. &quot;Our position is that arms control 

treaties should reduce nuclear dangers with real cuts.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Putin and Bush will meet in St. Petersburg May 23-26 to sign the 

new agreement and to discuss principles for the new relationship 

between the two countries. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We're happy that the two presidents plan to take thousands more 

nuclear weapons off their dangerous, high-alert status, but we urge 

Mr. Bush to truly make the world a safer place by committing to 

truly destroy these weapons and cease development of new, 

dangerous, war-fighting nuclear arms,&quot; said PSR Nuclear/Security 

Program Director Martin Butcher. &quot;There are already too many 

skeletons in the United States nuclear closet. These weapons are 

far too dangerous to be maintaining a shadow arsenal ready to 

deploy at a moment's notice.&quot; </font></p>
