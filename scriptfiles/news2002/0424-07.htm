- April 24 - 

In a letter sent to the White House Tuesday evening, the Rev. Dr. C. Welton Gaddy, executive director of The Interfaith Alliance, called on President George W. Bush to stand by his campaign promise to practice civility in government, integrity and respect for the dignity of others. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;When then candidate Bush signed our Framework of Civility pledge during his campaign, he made a laudable commitment to change the tone in Washington and to restore civility to the national dialogue,&#148; explained Gaddy. &#147;Today, we have to observe that the recent broadside of attack advertising campaigns, like the one that compared Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to Saddam Hussein, fly in the face of that commitment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter, identified &#147;a disquieting tendency in some quarters of your Administration to attack other governmental leaders who have asked questions in accord with their Constitutional responsibilities,&#148; citing comments made by Attorney General John Ashcroft which work against efforts to strengthen a national commitment to freedom. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signed by President Bush in December of 1999, The Interfaith Alliance&#146;s &#147;Framework of Civility for Political Candidates&#148; called on presidential and congressional candidates to &#147;reject personal attacks, innuendo, or stereotyping in describing or referring to your opponent&#148; and to &#147;avoid all references, characterizations, or suggestions intended or likely to demonize or dehumanize those holding opinions different from yours.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In signing the pledge, candidate Bush said, &#147;I support the principles outlined in The Interfaith Alliance's Framework of Civility for Political Candidates, and will urge those who support me, to the best of my ability, to do the same.&#148; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#147;As in the past, we continue to stand ready to work with you and your administration in advancing the value of civility in our society and an appreciation for religious pluralism throughout the nation,&#148; wrote Gaddy. &#147; I urge you to provide the kind of strong moral direction you have shown during the nation&#146;s powerful response to the September 11 attacks, the very kind of leadership that is needed to put a stop to the politics of personal destruction. </font></p>
