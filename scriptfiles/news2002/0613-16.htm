- June 13 - Last week thousands of people who organized under the banner Americans 
For Safe Access (ASA) disrupted business-as-usual at 50 regional outposts of the 
Drug Enforcement Administration, including the Department of Justice in Washington, 
DC. The protests were organized to publicize an expected permanent injunction 
that was granted yesterday by US District Court Judge Charles Breyer which orders 
the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative plus other groups in Marin and Ukiah 
counties to stop distributing the medicine to certified patients. The June 6th 
day of action, which called on the DEA to &quot;Cease and Desist,&quot; resulted 
in the closure or slowdown of operations at numerous DEA offices and at least 
18 arrests. It was the first coordinated nationwide day of protest against the 
DEA since the agency began raiding medical marijuana dispensaries in California 
last October. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thousands of people nationwide 
participated in the protests that were organized in less than three weeks. Over 
1500 people have pledged to resist the federal crackdown by disrupting business-as-usual 
at DEA offices the day after the next raid. &quot;In the coming weeks and months 
we expect the DEA to attempt to close more dispensaries which serve seriously 
ill people,&quot; says Hilary McQuie, Campaign Coordinator for ASA. &quot;We are 
seeing rising enthusiasm to fight the government crack down.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to an emergency 
action plan to respond to the next raid, attorneys for the dispensaries plan to 
appeal the injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court on the grounds that the government 
lacks constitutional authority to intervene under the interstate commerce clause, 
10th, 9th, and 5th amendments. No appellate decision is expected for another 10 
months. In the meantime, medical marijuana supporters continue to mobilize for 
the worst. Now legal in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, 
Nevada, Oregon and Washington, dispensaries are the only safe source for seriously 
ill patients to access medical marijuana. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Highlights from the Protests: 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">San Francisco: More than 
100 people staged a sit-in at the DEA's local office resulting in eight arrests. 
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Washington, DC: Ten people 
were arrested for using chains and pipes to lock themselves to the main entrance 
of the Department of Justice while 50 supporters cheered. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Los Angeles: Five supporters 
of the sale of marijuana for medical purposes at a West Hollywood building launched 
an &quot;open-ended hunger strike and encampment&quot; against federal authorities 
who last week filed a forfeiture action against the property. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Santa Rosa, CA: 300 people 
attended a rally and march to the Federal Building. The group intending civil 
disobedience blockaded the building's entrance, but the Santa Rosa Police declined 
to arrest anyone for trespassing, as the DEA office had shut down for the day 
in anticipation of protests. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Austin, TX: Activists hung 
a 34-foot banner from the Zilker Park moon tower. The banner read &quot;Medicine&quot; 
overlaid on a cannabis leaf. More details about each of the protests around the 
country can be found online at <a href="http://www.safeaccessnow.org" target="_new">http://www.safeaccessnow.org</a>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans for Safe Access 
is an aggressive grassroots campaign designed to force the federal government 
to stop its attack on patients and respect the rights of voters in States to choose 
medical marijuana policy. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our Demands: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. We demand that all prosecutions 
of medical marijuana patients, growers, and dispensaries cease immediately! </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. We demand that President 
Bush &amp; Attorney General Ashcroft declare a moratorium on the Federal anti-Medical 
Marijuana campaign. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. We demand President Bush 
declare his support for HR 2592, the States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act.
