- June 17 - Americans United for Separation of Church and State criticized the 
House of Representatives for approving a bill that would require the federal government 
to sell over 900 acres of federal land in Wyoming to the Mormon Church. The measure 
passed on a voice vote this afternoon.</font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">H.R. 4103, sponsored by Rep. Jim 
Hansen (R-Utah), would sell 940 acres of land in Wyoming to the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Under the terms of the legislation, no other parties 
would be permitted to make offers on the property, which is currently under the 
control of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Americans United said the proposal 
raises serious constitutional questions and should have been defeated.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This bill is a sweetheart deal 
for one faith tradition,&quot; said AU's Lynn. &quot;If the Constitution means 
anything, it means that Congress can't single out one religion for special treatment.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The church has a special interest 
in the land because of Mormon history. In 1856, a group of Mormon settlers died 
on the land -- known as Martin's Cove -- after a snowstorm blanketed the area. 
As a result, the church now considers the area sacred.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AU's Lynn said there are several 
reasons why Hansen's proposal to sell Martin's Cove violates the First Amendment:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* The U.S. Supreme Court has said 
Congress cannot give benefits to religious institutions through &#8220;a special 
and unusual Act of the legislature.&#8221; The Martin&#8217;s Cove legislation 
gives benefits solely to one religious group by selling land in a non-competitive 
process.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* The Supreme Court has ruled that 
government action is unconstitutional if its purpose is religious, not secular. 
The Mormon Church wants to buy the land because it considers Martin&#8217;s Cove 
to be sacred. As such, there is no secular purpose for the sale since it can only 
be intended to benefit the Mormon religion.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* The Supreme Court has held that 
the First Amendment prohibits the government from passing legislation that a reasonable 
observer would perceive as favoring a particular religion. A reasonable observer 
would not view passage of this bill as anything other than favoring the Mormon 
Church.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">AU's Lynn said the bill undermines 
basic constitutional principles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;This bill would sell a national 
site to a religious group for a religious purpose,&quot; Lynn said. &quot;The 
First Amendment requires government neutrality on religion, not special treatment 
for certain religious groups. The Senate should do what the House did not -- reject 
this legislation.&quot;</font></p>
