<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SONOMA STATE UNIVERSITY, 

CA - August 28 - The media research group Project Censored at Sonoma State University 

announced today its list of the most under-covered &quot;censored&quot; news stories 

of 2001-2002. The censored news stories are published in the annual book Censored 

2003 from Seven Stories Press. The Sonoma State University research group is composed 

of nearly 200 faculty, students, and community experts who reviewed over 900 nominations 

for the 2003 awards. The top 25 stories were ranked by the Project's national 

judges including: Michael Parenti, Robert McChesney, Robin Andersen, Norman Solomon, 

Carl Jensen, Lenore Foerstel and some 20 other national journalists, scholars, 

and writers. &quot;We define censorship as any interference with the free flow 

of information in American Society,&quot; stated Peter Phillips Director of the 

Project, &quot;Corporate media in the United States is interested primarily in 

entertainment news to feed their bottom-line priorities. Very important news stories 

that should reach the American public often fall on the cutting room floor to 

be replaced by sex-scandals and celebrity updates.&quot; Project Censored has 

moved to a new cycle for the release of their annual censored stories. The Censored 

2003 book will be released in September to bookstores nationwide. The annual Project 

Censored awards ceremony will be held at Sonoma State University September 28 

in Evert Person Theater at 7:00 PM. ($20 regular $10 students and seniors) Political 

Analyst/author Michael Parenti and cartoonist Dan Perkins aka Tom Tomorrow will 

be the keynotes speakers for the event. Davey D of KPFA's Hardknock radio will 

be MC for the evening. Authors of the years' most censored stories will speak 

and receive their awards. Press review copies of Censored 2003 are available by 

calling Seven Stories Press at 212-226-8760 or e-mail greg@sevenstories.com To 

purchase a personal copy of Censored 2003 call 707-664-2500 or visit www.projectcensored.org.

Title: &quot;Legal Project to Challenge Media Monopoly&quot;<br>

Author: Dorothy Kidd - kiddd@usfca.edu</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For almost 70 years, the 

Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has administered and regulated the broadcast 

spectrum as an electronic &quot;commons&quot; on behalf of the American people. 

The FCC issues licenses to broadcasters that allow them, for a fee, to use, but 

not own, one or more specific radio or TV frequencies. Thus, the public has retained 

the ability to regulate, as well as influence, access to broadcast communications. 

Several years ago, the Progress and Freedom Foundation, in their report &quot;The 

Telecom Revolution: An American Opportunity,&quot; recommended a complete privatization 

of the radio frequencies, whereby broadcasters with existing licenses would eventually 

gain complete ownership of their respective frequencies. They could thereafter 

develop them in markets of their choosing, or sell and trade them to other companies. 

The few non-allocated bands of the radio frequency spectrum would be sold off, 

as electronic real estate, to the highest bidders. With nothing then to regulate, 

the FCC would eventually be abolished. The reasoning behind this radical plan 

was that government control of the airwaves has led to inefficiencies. In private 

hands, the frequencies would be exchanged in the marketplace, and the forces of 

free-market supply and demand would foster the most creative (and, of course, 

most profitable) use of these electronic &quot;properties.&quot; This privatization 

proposal was considered too ambitious by the Clinton administration. However, 

in February 2001, within months after a more &quot;pro-business&quot; president 

took office, 37 leading US economists requested, in a joint letter, that the FCC 

allow broadcasters to lease, in secondary markets, the frequencies they currently 

use under their FCC license. Their thinking was that with this groundwork laid, 

full national privatization would follow, and eventually nations would be encouraged 

to sell off their frequencies to global media enterprises. Michael K. Powell, 

FCC Chairman, and son of Secretary of State Colin Powell, in a recent speech compared 

the FCC to the Grinch, a kind of regulatory spoilsport that could impede what 

he termed a historic transformation akin to the opening of the West. &quot;The 

oppressor here is regulation,&quot; he declared. In April 2001, Powell dismissed 

the FCC's historic mandate to evaluate corporate actions based on the public interest. 

That standard, he said, &quot;is about as empty a vessel as you can accord a regulatory 

agency.&quot; In other comments, Powell has signaled what kind of philosophy he 

prefers to the outdated concept of public interest. During his first visit to 

Capitol Hill as chairman, Powell referred to corporations simply as &quot;our 

clients.&quot; Challenges to this proposed privatization of airways have emerged 

from a number of sources. One group, the Democratic Media Legal Project (DMLP) 

in San Francisco, argues that even the existing commercial media system, aided 

by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is unconstitutional because it limits diversity 

of viewpoints, omits or misrepresents most social, political, and cultural segments, 

and is unaccountable to the public. Therefore, explains DMLP, advertising-based 

media and the 1996 Act, which encourages mergers and cross-ownership of media 

outlets to the exclusion of the vast majority of people, have deprived the people 

of their right to

self-governance- as self governance can occur only when we have the unimpeded 

and uncensored flow of opinion and reporting that are requisite for an informed 

democracy. The course of wireless broadcasting is approaching an unprecedented 

and critical crossroad. The path taken by the United States, and by the other 

industrialized nations that may follow our lead, will profoundly influence the 

ability of the citizenry of each country to democratically control the media.

to Privatize Global Social Services</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Source: The Ecologist, February, 

2001<br>

Title: The Last Frontier<br>

Author: Maude Barlow - pperdue@canadians.org</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A global trade agreement 

now being negotiated will seek to privatize nearly every government-provided public 

service and allow transnational corporations to run them for profit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a proposed free-trade agreement 

that will attempt to liberalize/dismantle barriers that protect government provided 

social services. These are social services bestowed by the government in the name 

of public welfare. The GATS was established in 1994, at the conclusion of the &quot;Uruguay Round&quot; of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 

In 1995, the GATS agreement was adopted by the newly created World Trade Organization 

(WTO). Corporations plan to use the GATS agreement to profit from the privatization 

of educational systems, health care systems, child care, energy and municipal 

water services, postal services, libraries, museums, and public transportation. 

If the GATS agreement is finalized, it will lock in a privatized, for-profit model 

for the global economy. GATS/WTO would make it illegal for a government with privatized 

services to ever return to a publicly owned, non-profit model. Any government 

that disobeys these WTO rulings will face sanctions. What used to be areas of 

common heritage like seed banks, air and water supplies, health care and education 

will be commodified, privatized, and sold to the highest bidder on the open market. 

People who cannot afford these privatized services will be left out. Services 

are the fastest growing sector of international trade. If GATS is implemented, 

corporations will reap windfall profits. Health care, education, and water services 

are the most potentially lucrative. Global expenditures on water services exceed 

$1 trillion each year, on education they exceed $2 trillion, and on health care 

they're over $3.5 trillion. The WTO has hired a private company called the Global 

Division for Transnational Education. This company plans to document policies 

that &quot;discriminate against foreign education providers.&quot; The results 

of this 'study' will be used to pressure countries with public education systems 

to relinquish them to the global privatized marketplace. The futures of accountability 

for public services, and of sovereign law are at stake with the GATS decision. 

Foreign corporations will have the right to establish themselves in any GATS/WTO-controlled 

country and compete against non-profit or government institutions, such as schools 

and hospitals, for public funds. The current round of GATS negotiations has identified 

three main priorities for future free-trade principles. First, GATS officials 

are pushing for &quot;National Treatment&quot; to be applied across the board. 

&quot;National Treatment&quot; would forbid governments from favoring their domestic 

companies over foreign-based companies. This idea already applies to certain services, 

but GATS will enforce it to all services. This will create an expansion of mega-corporate 

access to domestic markets and further diminish democratic accountability. The 

economically dominant western countries would like to make it illegal for &quot;developing&quot; 

countries to reverse this exclusive access to their markets. Second, GATS officials 

are seeking to place restrictions on domestic regulations. This would limit a 

government's ability to enact environmental, health, and other regulations and 

laws that hinder &quot;free-trade.&quot; The government would be required to demonstrate 

that its laws and regulations were necessary to achieve a WTO-sanctioned objective, 

and that no other commercially friendly alternative was available. Third, negotiators 

are attempting to develop the expansion of &quot;Commercial Presence&quot; rules. 

These rules allow an investor in one GATS-controlled country to establish a presence 

in any other GATS country. The investor will not only be allowed to compete against 

private suppliers for business, but will also be allowed to compete against publicly 

funded institutions and services for public funds.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This potential expansion of GATS/WTO authority into the day-to-day business of 

governments will make it nearly impossible for citizens to exercise democratic 

control over the future of traditionally public services. One American trade official 

summed up the GATS/WTO process by saying, &quot;Basically it won't stop until 

foreigners finally start to think like Americans, act like Americans, and most 

of all shop like Americans.&quot; Faculty evaluator: John Kramer, Student researchers:

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the past two years, 

Colombia has been Washington's third largest recipient of foreign aid, behind 

only Israel and Egypt. In July of 2000, the U.S. Congress approved a $1.3 billion 

war package for Colombia to support President Pastrana's &quot;Plan Colombia.&quot; 

Plan Colombia is a $7.5 billion counter-narcotics initiative. In addition to this 

financial support, the US also trains the Colombian military. Colombia's annual 

murder rate is 30,000. It is reported that around 19,000 of these murders are 

linked to illegal right-wing paramilitary forces. Many leaders of these paramilitary 

groups were once officers in the Colombian military, trained at the U.S. Military 

run School of the Americas. According to the Human Rights Watch Report, a 120-page 

report titled &quot;The 'Sixth Division': Military-Paramilitary Ties and US Policy 

in Colombia,&quot; Colombian armed forces and police continue to work closely 

with right-wing paramilitary groups. The government of President Pastrana and 

the US administration have played down evidence of this cooperation. Jim Lobe 

says that Human Rights Watch holds the Pastrana administration responsible for 

the current, violent situation because of its dramatic and costly failure to take 

prompt, effective control of security forces, break their persistent ties to paramilitary 

groups, and ensure respect for human rights. Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. 

Clair contend that the war in Colombia isn't about drugs. It's about the annihilation 

of popular uprisings by Indian peasants fending off the ravages of oil companies, 

cattle barons and mining firms. It is a counter-insurgency war, designed to clear 

the way for American corporations to set up shop in Colombia. Cockburn and St. 

Clair examined two Defense Department commissioned reports, the RAND Report and 

a paper written by Gabriel Marcella, titled &quot;Plan Colombia: the Strategic 

and Operational Imperatives.&quot; Both reports recommend that the US step up 

its military involvement in Colombia. In addition, the reports make several admissions 

about the paramilitaries and their links to the drug trade, regarding human rights 

abuses by the US-trained Colombian military, and about the irrationality of crop 

fumigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Throughout these past two years, Colombian citizens have been the victims of human 

rights atrocities committed by the US-trained Colombian military and linked paramilitaries. 

Trade unionists and human rights activists face murder, torture, and harassment. 

It is reported that Latin America remains the most dangerous place in the world 

for trade unionists. Since 1986, some 4,000 trade unionists have been murdered 

in Colombia. In 2000 alone, more trade unionists were killed in Colombia than 

in the whole world in 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Another problem resulting from the Colombian &quot;drug war&quot; has been the 

health consequences of the US-sponsored aerial fumigation. Since January 2001, 

Colombian aircraft have been spraying toxic herbicides over Colombian fields in 

order to kill opium poppy and coca plants. These sprayings are killing food crops 

that indigenous Colombians depend on for survival, as well as harming their health. 

The sprayings have killed fish, livestock, and have contaminated water supplies.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The US provides slightly over 1 billion dollars of military aid for what is known 

as &quot;Plan Colombia,&quot; yet it is more a war against citizens and those 

who are fighting for social justice. US aid is not improving conditions for the 

people of Colombia, but rather supporting the government and right-wing paramilitary 

groups. According to an American member of the international steelworker delegation, 

Jesse Isbell, who recently visited Columbia, &quot;The US says one thing to the 

American public when in reality it is [doing] something totally different. Our 

government portrays this as a drug war against cocaine but all we are doing is 

keeping an ineffective government in power.&quot; Faculty Evaluators: Jorge Porras,

September&quot;<br>

Author: Greg Palast and David Pallister - Greg@gregPalast.com and david.pallister@guardian.co.uk</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A French book Bin Laden, 

la verite interdite (Bin Laden, the forbidden

truth) claims that the Bush Administration halted investigations into terrorist 

activities related to the bin Laden family and began planning for a war against 

Afghanistan before 9-11. The authors, Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, 

are French intelligence analysts. Dasquie, an investigative reporter, publishes 

Intelligence Online, which is a respected newsletter on economics and diplomacy. 

Brisard worked for French secret services and in 1997 wrote a report on the Al 

Qaeda network. In 1996, high-placed intelligence sources in Washington told the 

Guardian, &quot;There were always constraints on investigating the Saudis.&quot; 

The authors allege that under the influence of US oil companies, George W. Bush 

and his administration initially halted investigations into terrorism, while bargaining 

with the Taliban to deliver Osama bin Laden in exchange for economic aid and political 

recognition. The book goes on to reveal that former FBI deputy director John O'Neill 

resigned in July of 2001 in protest over the obstruction of terrorist investigations. 

According to O'Neill, &quot;The main obstacles to investigating Islamic terrorism 

were US oil corporate interests and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it.&quot; 

The restrictions were said to have worsened after the Bush administration took 

over. Intelligence agencies were told to &quot;back off&quot; from investigations 

involving other members of the bin Laden family, the Saudi royals, and possible 

Saudi links to the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Pakistan. John O'Neil died 

on 9/11 in the World Trade Center. An FBI file coded 199, which means a case involving 

national security, records that Abdullah bin Laden, who lived in Washington, originally 

had a file opened on him &quot;because of his relationship with the Saudi-funded 

World Assembly of Muslim Youth - a suspected terrorist organization.&quot; The 

BBC reiterated a well-known claim, made by one of George W. Bush's former business 

partners, that Bush made his first million dollars 20 years ago from a company 

financed by Osama's elder brother, Salem. It has also been revealed that both 

the Bushs and the bin Ladens had lucrative stakes in the Carlyle Group, a private 

investment firm that has grown to be one of the largest investors in US defense 

and communications contracts. Brisard and Dasquie contend that the government's 

main objective in Afghanistan was to unite the Taliban regime in order to gain 

access to the oil and gas reserves in Central Asia. Brisard and Dasquie report 

that the Bush government began negotiations with the Taliban directly after coming 

into power and representatives met several times in Washington, Islamabad, and 

Berlin. There were also claims that the last meeting between the United States 

and Taliban representatives took place only five weeks before the attacks in New 

York and Washington. Long before the September 11th attacks, the United States 

had decided to invade Afghanistan in the interest of oil. In February of 1998, 

at the hearing before a sub-group of the Committee on International Relations, 

Congress discussed ways to deal with Afghanistan to make way for an oil pipeline. 

Jane's Defense News reported in March 2001 that an invasion of Afghanistan was 

being planned. Times of India reported that in June of 2001, the US Government 

told India that there would be an invasion of Afghanistan in October of that year. 

By July of 2001 George Arney, with the BBC, also reported the planned invasion.

Iraq's Water System</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sources:<br>

The Progressive, September 2001<br>

Title: &quot;The Secret Behind the Sanctions: How the U.S. Intentionally Destroyed 

Iraq's Water Supply&quot;<br>

Author: Thomas J. Nagy - nagy@gwu.edu<br>

www.progressive.org</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the Gulf War the 

United States deliberately bombed Iraq's water system. After the war, the U.S. 

pushed sanctions to prevent importation of necessary supplies for water purification. 

These actions resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians 

many of whom were young children. Documents have been obtained from the Defense 

Intelligence Agency (DIA), which prove that the Pentagon was fully aware of the 

mortal impacts on civilians in Iraq and was actually monitoring the degradation 

of Iraq's water supply. The destruction of civilian infrastructures necessary 

for health and welfare is a direct violation of the Geneva Convention. After the 

Gulf War, the United Nations applied sanctions against Iraq, which denied the 

importation of specialized equipment and chemicals, such as chlorine for purification 

of water. There are six documents that have been partially declassified and can 

be found on the Pentagon's web site at www.gulflink.osd.mil. These documents include 

information that prove that the United States was fully aware of the costs to 

civilians, especially children, by upholding the sanctions against purification 

of Iraq's water supply. The primary document is dated January 22, 1991 and is 

titled, &quot;Iraq Water Treatment Vulnerabilities.&quot; This document predicts 

what will take place when Iraq can no longer import the vital commodities to cleanse 

their water supply. It states that epidemics and disease outbreaks may occur because 

of pollutants and bacteria that exist in unpurified water. The document acknowledges 

the fact that without purified drinking water, the manufacturing of food and medicine 

will also be affected. The possibilities of Iraqis obtaining clean water, despite 

sanctions, along with a timetable describing the degradation of Iraq's water supply 

was also addressed. The remaining five documents from the DIA confirm the Pentagon's 

monitoring of the situation in Iraq. In more than one document, discussion of 

the likely outbreaks of diseases and how they affect &quot;particularly children&quot; 

is discussed in great detail. The final document titled, &quot;Iraq: Assessment 

of Current Health Threats and Capabilities,&quot; is dated, November 15, 1991, 

and discusses the development of a counter-propaganda strategy that would blame 

Saddam Hussein for the lack of safe water in Iraq. The United States' insistence 

on using this type of sanction against Iraq is in direct violation of the Geneva 

Convention. The Geneva Convention was created in 1979 to protect the victims of 

international armed conflict. It states, &quot;It is prohibited to attack, destroy, 

remove or render useless, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian 

population such as foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installation and 

supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their 

sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever 

the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, 

or for any other motive.&quot; The United States, for nearly a decade, has &quot;destroyed, 

removed, or rendered useless&quot; Iraq's &quot;drinking water installations and 

supplies.&quot; Although two Democratic Representatives, Cynthia McKinney from 

Georgia and Tony Hall from Ohio, have spoken out about the degradation of Iraq's 

water supply and its civilian targets, no acknowledgment of violations has been 

made. The U.S. policy of destroying the water treatment system of Iraq and preventing 

its re-establishment has been pursued for more than a decade. The United Nations 

estimates that more than 500,000 Iraqi children have died as a result of sanctions 

and that unclean water is a major contributor to these deaths. Faculty evaluator:

Nuclear Revival</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sources:<br>

Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists, July/August 2001<br>

Title: &quot;The New-Nuke Chorus Tunes Up&quot;<br>

Author: Stephen I. Schwartz - sschwartz@thebulletin.org</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US Government is blazing 

a trail of nuclear weapon revival leading to global nuclear dominance. A nuke-revival 

group, supported by people like Stephen Younger, Associate Director for Nuclear 

Weapons at Los Alamos, proposes a &quot;mini-nuke&quot; capable of burrowing into 

underground weapon supplies and unleashing a small, but contained nuclear explosion. 

This weapons advocacy group is comprised of nuclear scientists, Department of 

Energy (DoE) officials, right wing analysts, former government officials, and 

a congressionally appointed over-sight panel. The group wants to ensure that the 

U.S. continues to develop nuclear capacity into the next half century. Achieving 

this goal of nuclear dominance will take far more than just refurbishing existing 

weapons and developing new ones. A decade long effort, that would cost in the 

$8 billion range, would be needed just to bring old production sites up to standard. 

Billions more would be needed to produce and maintain a new generation of nuclear 

weapons. This plan has not been presented to the public for their consideration 

or approval.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Part of the plan includes the building of &quot;mini-nukes,&quot; which would 

have a highly accurate ability to penetrate underground stockpiles of weapons 

and command centers. The recent interest in such weapons is based on two premises. 

First, the belief that only nuclear weapons can destroy these underground networks, 

so the &quot;mini-nuke&quot; would deter other countries from using these underground 

systems. Second, these new bombs would give government the option to launch a 

nuclear strike to take out a small target while delivering minimal civilian casualties. 

It is believed that these bombs could specifically target underground headquarters 

or weapon stockpiles in Korea, Iraq, or Iran.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Princeton theoretical physicist Robert W. Nelson has studied the question for 

the Federation of American Scientists. Nelson concluded, &quot;No earth-burrowing 

missile can penetrate deep enough into the earth to contain an explosion with 

a nuclear yield even as small as 1 percent of the 15-kiloton Hiroshima weapon. 

The explosion simply blows out a massive crater of radioactive dirt, which rains 

down on the local region with an especially intense and deadly fallout.&quot; 

Nelson used data from the Plowshares program of the 1960s and from the 828 underground 

nuclear tests conducted in Nevada. The two sources show that full containment 

of a 5-kiloton explosion is only possible at 650 feet or more, while a 1-kiloton 

explosion must take place at least 450 feet into the earth. These figures are 

taken at optimum conditions, where weapons are placed in a specially sealed shaft 

in a well understood geological environment. The &quot;mini-nukes&quot; will be 

expected to penetrate into deeply hardened targets in unyielding conditions. Nelson 

also concludes that a 10-foot missile could only be expected to penetrate 100 

feet into concrete and steel, a depth far too shallow to contain even a very small 

explosion.</font></p>

Nuclear Stockpile has recommended spending $4 billion to $6 billion over the next 

decade to restore the production capabilities of plutonium pit plants in the U.S. 

The DoE is currently spending $147 million on pit production at Los Alamos this 

year and is requesting $218 million for 2002. A renovated Los Alamos will be capable 

of producing up to 20 pits a year by 2007. Last year the DoE received $2 million 

to design a new pit plant capable of producing 450 cores of plutonium a year. 

This would generate approximately half the amount of plutonium produced during 

the latter period of the Cold War. The facilities at some of these nuclear production 

plants are in drastic states of disrepair. Only 26 percent of the weapons complex 

buildings are in excellent or good condition. One laboratory building at Los Alamos 

wraps pipes carrying radioactive waste in plastic bags to prevent leakage. The 

roofs at other facilities are allowing rainwater to seep into the rooms where 

nuclear weapons are inspected and repaired. Faculty Evaluator: Sasha Von Meier,

Title: &quot;Testing, Testing: The Miseducation of George W. Bush&quot;<br>

Author: Linda Lutton</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For decades, public schools 

have purchased innumerable products and services from private companies-from text 

books to bus transportation. Within the last decade, however, privatization has 

taken on a whole new meaning. Proponents of privatized education are now interested 

in taking over entire school districts. &quot;Education today, like healthcare 

30 years ago, is a vast, highly localized industry ripe for change,&quot; says 

Mary Tanner, managing director of Lehman Brothers, &quot;The emergence of HMOs 

and hospital management companies created enormous opportunities for investors. 

We believe the same pattern will occur in education.&quot; So while the aptly 

named Educational Management Organizations (EMO's) are being promoted as the new 

answer to impoverished school districts and dilapidated classrooms, the real emphasis 

is on investment returns rather than student welfare and educational development. 

According to some analysts, Bush's proposal for national standardized testing 

is helping to pave the way for these EMO's. Bush wants yearly standardized testing 

in reading and math for every student in the country between the third and eighth 

grades. &quot;School districts and states that do well will be rewarded,&quot; 

Bush states in his education agenda, No Child Left Behind, &quot;Failure will 

be sanctioned.&quot; The effect of Bush's testing plan will be nothing less than 

a total reconstruction of curriculum and instruction across the country. Perversely, 

schools with already limited resources, serving poor and minority communities, 

will be those under the greatest pressure to boost scores or face loss of funding. 

Additionally, standardized testing funnels public dollars directly to non-public 

schools, including religious schools, through taxpayer-supported vouchers. School 

vouchers, proposed by Bush in his education plan to increase federal education 

spending, will reward schools that do well on annual standardized tests. Vouchers 

shunt kids out of the public schools system and into private for-profit institutions. 

Since only public school students take the standardized tests, kids whose parents 

can afford private schools don't have to agonize year after year about potential 

failure. Standardized testing hits immigrant students especially hard. Bush wants 

to freeze funding in 2002, despite surging enrollment of students speaking limited 

English. Angelo Amador, a national policy analyst for the Mexican American Legal 

Defense and Education Fund, says, &quot;With the pulling of bilingual education 

funding, states with high-stakes testing are pushing low-performing Latino students 

into special education classes or out of school altogether in an effort to keep 

their test scores high.&quot; Critics charge that standardization's real goal 

is not to improve public education but to disparage it while building support 

for privatized, union-free alternatives. Proponents of corporate-run education 

claim that, by cutting the &quot;fat&quot; out of the system, they can improve 

student achievement with the same amount of money, and still turn a profit (Ignoring 

the fact that the U.S. is ranked ninth globally in terms of money spent on education). 

The reality is that, though most EMO's have yet to show investors a profit, they 

generally cut teacher salaries, eliminate remedial, special, and bilingual education 

programs (mandated for public schools), and consistently perform at or below the 

level of surrounding schools in test scores. Privatization opponents say that 

public education should serve and be run by the public, especially teachers and 

parents, as opposed to shareholders who run the for-profit companies. Faculty

Title: NAFTA gives the shafta to North America's farmers<br>

Author: Jim Hightower - info@jimhightower.com</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The North American Free 

Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are responsible 

for the impoverishment of and loss of many small farms in Mexico and Haiti. NAFTA 

is also causing the economic destruction of rural farming communities in the United 

States and Canada. The resulting loss of rural employment has created a landslide 

of socio-economic and environmental consequences that are worsening with the continued 

dismantling and deregulation of trade barriers. When NAFTA came before Congress 

in 1993, US farmers were told that the agreement would open the borders of Mexico 

and Canada, enabling them to sell their superior products and achieve previously 

unknown prosperity. Corporations who operate throughout the Americas, such as 

Tyson and Cargill, have since used the farming surplus to drive down costs, pitting 

farmers against each other and prohibiting countries from taking protective actions. 

These same corporations have entered into massive farming ventures outside the 

U.S. and use NAFTA to import cheaper agricultural products back into this country, 

further undermining the small farmers in the U.S. Since the enactment of NAFTA, 

80% of foodstuffs coming into the U.S. are products that displace crops raised 

here at home. NAFTA has allowed multinational mega-corporations to increase production 

in Mexico, where they can profit from much cheaper labor, as well as freely use 

chemicals and pesticides banned in the U.S. In both Mexico and Haiti, NAFTA policies 

have caused an exodus from rural areas forcing people to live in urban slums and 

accept low paid sweatshop labor. Farmers in Mexico, unable to compete with the 

large-scale importation and chemical-intensive mass production of U.S. agricultural 

corporations, are swimming in a corn surplus that has swelled approximately 450% 

since NAFTA's implementation. Haiti's deregulation of trade with the U.S. has 

destroyed the island's rice industry in a similar manner. Urban slums, engorged 

with rural economic refugees, are contributing to the breakdown of cultural traditions 

and public authority, making the growing masses increasingly ungovernable. The 

Mexican government clashes violently with any organized protest of NAFTA. Dissent 

in Chiapas and in Central Mexico has lead to the reported arrests, injuries, and 

deaths of dozens of activists. Community leaders like Minister Lucius Walker, 

executive of the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization, state that, 

&quot;The biggest challenge facing all of us in this new millennium is to build 

a citizens' movement to counter the corporate captivity of the Americas.&quot; 

The1993 NAFTA agreement desolated small farming communities in the U.S. and in 

Mexico and Haiti. With the scheduled 2009 lift on tariffs and import restrictions, 

as well as Bush's proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas

(FTAA) adding 31 more countries to the NAFTA agreement, many additional farming 

communities are in danger. Faculty Evaluators: Tony White, Al Wahrhaftig Student

Crisis</font></p>

Title: &quot;There's No Place Like Home&quot;<br>

Author: Randy Shaw - randy@thclinic.org</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The national housing crisis 

affects nearly 6 million American families and is growing worse. Over 1.5 million 

low-cost housing units have recently been lost, and millions of children are growing 

up in housing that is substandard, unaffordable and dangerous. A new crisis in 

affordable housing is spreading across America. What was once a problem relegated 

to low income families along the east and west coasts, is now affecting the middle-class 

all across the country. Middle-class working Americans are having just as much 

trouble finding affordable housing as low-income families did ten years ago. In 

San Francisco, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subsidizing 

housing for public school teachers. California business groups complain that the 

State's housing shortage hinders their ability to attract skilled workers, and 

chambers of commerce link lack of affordable housing to a resultant slowdown in 

economic growth. Julie Daniels earns $28,000 a year working full time as a certified 

nursing assistant for Stamford, Connecticut. A member of local 1199, Daniels and 

her three children have been unable to obtain affordable housing within traveling 

distance of her job. The family's only available housing option has been a homeless 

shelter, and the prospects that Daniels will obtain safe and affordable housing 

are unlikely. Still, politicians refuse to add federal funded housing to the U.S. 

budget. Low-cost housing programs are slowly being drained of funding. More than 

100,000 federally subsidized units have been converted to market-rate housing 

in the past three years. While the $5 billion Federal Housing Administration surplus 

is tied up in Washington, neither major political party seems responsive to the 

current housing crisis. Neither party is addressing issues of living wage, adequate 

health care, or affordable housing. Homelessness has become the result for many 

families across the nation. The economic slowdown, the welfare reform of 1996, 

and the events of September 11 are pushing hard working Americans into the street. 

In New York alone it is estimated that 30,000 people are living in shelters, and 

many thousands more live on the street. In Chicago, over 20,000 units of public 

housing units have been removed from service and some 50,000 people now reside 

in the streets. In an era when there is only one apartment for every six potential 

renters in this country, Congress has taken no action to address this problem. 

Corporate media has only covered this issue locally and few corporate media reports 

have recognized this as a national crisis. Faculty Evaluator: Susan Garfin, Student

Title: &quot;NATO Invades Macedonia&quot;<br>

Author: Michel Chossudovsky</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CIA destabilized the 

political balance in Macedonia to allow easier access for a US-British owned oil 

pipeline, and to prevent Macedonia from entering the European Union (EU), thereby 

strengthening the US dollar in a German deutschmark dominated region. Without 

Macedonia in the EU, British and US oil companies have an advantage over European 

counterparts in building oil pipelines. Actions toward destabilization intend 

to impose economic control over national currencies, and protect British-US oil 

companies such as BP-Amoco-ARCO, Chevron, and Texaco against Europe's Total-Fina-Elf. 

The British-US consortium controls the AMBO Trans-Balkin pipeline project linking 

the Bulgarian port of Burgas to Vlore on the Albanian Adriatic coastline. The 

power game is designed to increase British-US domination in the region by distancing 

Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Albania from the influence of EU countries such as Germany, 

Italy, France and Belgium. It's an effort supported by Wall Street's financial 

establishment, to destabilize and discredit the deutschmark and the Euro, with 

hopes of imposing the US dollar as the sole currency for the region. The Kosovo 

Liberation Army (KLA) and the National Liberation Army (NLA) were trained in Macedonia 

by British Special Forces and equipped by the CIA. British military sources confirm 

that Gezim Ostremi, NLA Commander, was sponsored by the UN and trained by British 

Special Forces to head the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC). When Ostremi left his 

job as a United Nations Officer to join the NLA, the commander remained on the 

UN payroll. Attacks within Macedonia by the NLA/KLA last year, coincided chronologically 

with the process of EU enlargement and the signing of the historic Stabilization 

and Association Agreement (SAA) between the EU and Macedonia. These attacks paved 

the way for further US military and political presence in the region. In a strange 

twist the CIA, NATO, and British Special Forces provided weapons and training 

to the NLA/KLA terrorists, while at the same time, Germany provided Macedonia's 

security forces with all-terrain vehicles, advanced weapons, and equipment to 

protect themselves from NLA/KLA attacks. US military advisers, on assignment to 

the KLA/NLA through private mercenary companies, remained in contact with NATO 

and US military and intelligence planners. It was Washington and London who decided 

on the broad direction of KLA-NLA military operations in Macedonia. Following 

the August, 2001 Framework Peace Agreement, 3,500 armed NATO troops entered Macedonia 

with the intent of disarming Albanian rebels. Washington's humanitarian efforts 

for the NLA/KLA suggested its intent to protect the terrorists rather then disarm 

them. Vice President Dick Cheney's former firm, Halliburton Energy, is directly 

linked to the AMBO's Trans-Balkans Oil Pipeline. Last year's conflict in Macedonia 

is a small part of a growing rift between the Anglo-American and European interests 

in the Balkans. In the wake of the war in Yugoslavia, Britain has allied itself 

with the US and severed many of its ties with Germany, France, and Italy. Washington's 

design is to ensure the dominance of the US military-industrial complex, in alliance 

with Britain's major defense contractors, and British-US oil. These developments 

establish significant control over strategic pipelines, transportation, and communication 

corridors in the Balkans, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Faculty
