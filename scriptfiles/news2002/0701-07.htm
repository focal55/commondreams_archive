TN - July 1 - Environmental 
Protection Agency Administrator Christine Whitman is touring Great 
Smoky Mountains National Park today to tout a Bush Administration 
clean-air policy that will result in more pollution in the park, 
according to the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). 
Whitman slated her visit in response to an invitation by Senator 
Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) to see first-hand the air pollution crisis in 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, site of the highest recorded 
acid deposition in North America. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;We are grateful to Senator Frist for bringing Administrator 
Whitman to the Smokies to learn about the air pollution crisis at 
the nation's most visited national park,&quot; said Don Barger, 
southeast regional director for the National Parks Conservation 
Association. &quot;Unfortunately, the Bush Administration Clear Skies 
Initiative creates a smokescreen for the its recently announced 
rollbacks of the Clean Air Act, an attack unprecedented in the 
law's 32-year history.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This will be Whitman's first public appearance after a 
controversial announcement to weaken the New Source Review (NSR) 
program established by the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments. The 
existing program requires new sources of air pollution, including 
power plants and refineries, to install state of the art 
pollution-control technology, with special provisions to protect 
parks and wilderness areas. NSR also requires old facilities 
undergoing major modifications that result in pollution increases 
to install pollution controls that new sources must have. The Bush 
Administration would allow 17,000 outdated facilities, including 
power plants, to operate indefinitely with limited or no pollution 
controls. The Bush Administration also intends to abandon or limit 
measures to ensure that parks and wilderness areas are protected 
from new source emissions. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;An ill-advised loophole in the law has allowed these old, dirty 
plants to profit at the expense of the health of people and parks,&quot; 
said Barger. &quot;Now that it's time to pay the bill for the last 
quarter century's pollution, this Administration wants to change 
the rules. It is a shameful violation of the public trust.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EPA states these rollbacks are justified because President 
Bush's Clear Skies Initiative (CSI) would make the program 
unnecessary. CSI, through an act of Congress, would set pollution 
caps for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, and mercury. Although 
formally announced by President Bush in </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">February 2002, as yet no member of Congress has introduced a 
bill that reflects the president's proposal. On June 27, the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 556, the Clean 
Power Act, an effective proposal introduced by Vermont Senator Jim 
Jeffords. The Clean Power Act would require deeper cuts in 
emissions of all three pollutants in a much shorter time frame than 
would CSI, without weakening existing Clean Air law. It also would 
require reductions of carbon dioxide emissions, while CSI would 
allow these emissions to increase. Because CSI would eliminate 
several programs in addition to NSR, an analysis shows that CSI 
would offer fewer protections for clean air than would implementing 
the existing Clean Air Act. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;CSI coupled with these rollbacks of the Clean Air Act simply 
will not protect parks and people under siege by air pollution,&quot; 
said Barger. &quot;While the science and regulation of air pollution can 
be complex, one thing is simple: we must do more, not less, to 
protect parks and people from air pollution. The Administration is 
going in the wrong direction.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In March, Administrator Whitman testified before the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee claiming that the most 
improvements in air quality under CSI would be located &quot;along the 
Appalachian Trail, Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains.&quot; This area 
has traditionally been one of the most polluted in the country. In 
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, human-generated haze reduces 
views up to 80 percent. In the last four summers, park visitors 
found smog levels hazardous to their health on more than 140 days 
-- one out of every three days in the season. NPCA has placed the 
Smokies on its list of America's Ten Most Endangered National Parks 
for the past four years because of air pollution. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Because the Smokies suffers the highest levels of pollution, 
it's likely to see improvements from any serious emission reduction 
plan,&quot; said Barger. &quot;What the EPA Administrator avoids saying is 
that not only is the Bush Administration weakening existing law, 
its CSI proposal will fall far short of what the park needs.&quot; </font></p>
