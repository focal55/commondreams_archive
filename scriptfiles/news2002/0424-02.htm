- April 24 - <i>Following is a statement

by Susan Holmes, policy expert for Earthjustice:

</i></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last three decades, the Endangered Species Act has been

instrumental in preventing the loss of threatened and endangered

species. Still, there is more that can be done -- the goal of

recovery for many species has not yet been realized. The Endangered

Species Recovery Act (ESRA), introduced today by Rep. George Miller

(D-Calif.) and Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), addresses this

important issue. ESRA would strengthen our endangered species

protections by focusing new efforts on the recovery of healthy

populations of endangered species so they can be removed from the

endangered list.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By implementing recommendations of the National Academy of

Sciences designed to improve the scientific basis for important

endangered species decisions, ESRA makes sure that we use the best

science available. It requires that independent scientists peer

review large-scale habitat conservation plans; and means that

biologists, not politicians are telling us what it will take to

recover an imperiled species.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ESRA also improves citizen and landowner involvement. New tax

deferrals and incentives for good stewardship will encourage

landowners to keep large private landholdings intact. And it

expands opportunities for the public to participate in managing the

endangered species in their communities. By requiring public

notification when a federal activity may impact wildlife in their

neighborhoods, ESRA would improve the public's right to know. ESRA

would also require balanced public participation in large-scale

regional habitat planning, as well as allow citizen enforcement

when their local plans go awry.

</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now more then ever, with species like the grizzly bear, manatee,

and Pacific salmon under increased threat from irresponsible

development and loss of habitat, we are pleased to have strong

congressional leadership to focus new attention and resources on

the critical job of species recovery.</font></p>
