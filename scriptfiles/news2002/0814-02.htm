- August 14 - Ralph Nader today praised Representative Cynthia McKinney of Georgia's 

4th District, as one of the House of Representatives' strongest champions of consumers 

and workers. </font> 

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Representative McKinney has the courage to stand up against corporate 

and other special interests on legislation that really counts for low, moderate 

and middle income people in her district,&quot; Nader said. &quot;In fact, her 

record of battling for the consumer and working people has earned her plaudits 

from public interest groups across the nation.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nader pointed to the voting record compiled by Public Citizen which gives Representative 

McKinney a perfect 100 percent record on votes involving campaign finance reform, 

trade, Medicare, patients' bill of rights, workplace safety, energy and economic 

stimulus among other issues important to consumers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nader said he was particularly pleased to point to Representative McKinney's 

fight against efforts by banks, credit card companies, finance companies, automobile 

dealers, predatory lenders and gambling casinos to eliminate key protections for 

consumers who file for bankruptcy because of loss of jobs, large medical bills 

and other unforeseen economic hardships. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The lending industry has poured millions of dollars into lobbying campaigns 

which would convert bankruptcy laws into a harsh punitive system that would push 

debt-stricken consumers into a virtual debtors' prison,&quot; Nader said. &quot;To 

her great credit, Representative McKinney has been willing to defend consumers 

while many of her colleagues have caved to the pressure from the nation's largest 

financial institutions.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nader said Representative McKinney's independent stands and willingness &quot;to 

do the right thing&quot;, even in the face of sometimes heavy pressure from her 

colleagues and special interests, gives Georgia's 4th District a particularly 

strong voice in the House of Representatives. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;When Representative McKinney takes a strong pro-people stand, everyone 

knows that it is her considered judgment-not that of a lobbyist or a special interest 

poised to write a campaign check. Georgia's 4th District and the nation benefit 

from that independence,&quot; Nader said. </font></p>
