<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WASHINGTON - June 27 - In 
the wake of threats against human rights advocates in Afghanistan after the Loya 
Jirga and continued reports of violence against women in the provinces, the Feminist 
Majority has renewed its call for the immediate expansion of international peacekeeping 
troops in Afghanistan. Today, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and Deputy 
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz have been called before the U.S. Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee to answer questions about the lack of U.S. support for peace 
troop expansion beyond Kabul. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;President Bush promised 
that the U.S. would not abandon the Afghan people, especially Afghan women,&#8221; 
said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority. &#8220;It is now time 
for the Bush Administration to support an expansion in the number, mission, and 
jurisdiction of international peacekeeping troops and to support a significant 
increase in funding for reconstruction. Women&#8217;s rights, democracy, and stability 
cannot be restored without these two crucial ingredients.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Smeal continued: &#8220;Afghan 
women cannot wait any longer. The threats to Loya Jirga delegates who have spoken 
out for human rights, including Minister of Women&#8217;s Affairs Dr. Sima Samar; 
the uprising of police against the appointed Interior Minister; violence against 
women in the Northern provinces; and the use of tactics of intimidation against 
the return of girls to school in Kandahar show the need for security is desperate. 
How can we not expand peacekeeping forces under these current circumstances?&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">United Nations Secretary 
General Kofi Annan and the Afghan Interim Administration have repeatedly and urgently 
requested the expansion of peace troops beyond Kabul. In March, April, and again 
in May, the Feminist Majority Foundation and other major U.S. women&#8217;s organizations 
issued strong pleas to the Bush Administration for immediate expansion of peace 
troops. In response to the recent gang rape of an aid worker and violent interference 
with humanitarian aid delivery, 68 international nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs) recently joined the United Nations in a plea to the US to expand peacekeeping 
troops and ensure security throughout the country.</font></p>
