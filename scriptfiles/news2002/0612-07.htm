- June 12 - A new study released 
today by the Violence Policy Center (VPC) shows that Texas 
concealed handgun license holders have been arrested 5,314 times 
since the concealed handgun license law went into effect -- an 
average of two and one-half arrests every day from Jan. 1, 1996, 
until Aug. 31, 2001. Texas has a &quot;shall issue&quot; concealed carry 
system, in which an adult (21 or over), is issued a license that 
allows them to have a handgun on or about their person as long as 
it is not visible or discernible through ordinary observation after 
they meet specific, objective criteria. </FONT>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to &quot;License to Kill IV: More Guns, More Crime,&quot; from 
Jan. 1, 1996, through Aug. 31, 2001, there were 41 arrests for 
murder and attempted murder by concealed handgun license holders in 
Texas. &quot;License to Kill IV: More Guns, More Crime&quot; discusses the 
dangerous ramifications of concealed carry legislation and details 
the arrests of 11 concealed handgun license holders subsequent to 
licensure for the crimes of homicide, attempted homicide, and 
aggravated kidnapping. Arrest data is regularly accepted as a 
valid measure of crime, reflecting law enforcement response to 
criminal activity, and is used by agencies such as the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for its Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The NRA told Texans in 1996 that a concealed handgun law would 
make Texas a safer place,&quot; VPC Health Policy Analyst Karen Brock, 
MPH, said today. &quot;The thousands of arrests of concealed handgun 
license holders demonstrates the exact opposite to be true: license 
holders are committing crimes, not preventing them. States now 
considering concealed carry laws should learn from the dire 
consequences that Texans now live with day-in and day-out.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VPC analysis of the Texas Department of Public Safety's (DPS) 
data reveals that: </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- From 1996 to 2000, Texas concealed handgun license holders 
were arrested for weapon-related offenses at a rate 81 percent 
higher than that of the general population of Texas, aged 21 and 
older which amounts to more than one weapon-related offense every 
other day since the law went into effect. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Texas concealed handgun license holders have been arrested 
for more than two serious violent crimes per month since the law 
went into effect including: murder/attempted murder, 
manslaughter/negligent homicide, kidnapping, rape, and sexual 
assault. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Texas concealed handgun license holders have been arrested 
for more than two crimes against children per month since the law 
went into effect including: sexual assault/aggravated sexual 
assault on a child, injury to a child, indecency with a child, 
abandon/endanger a child, solicitation of a minor, and possession 
or promotion of child pornography. </font></p>
