- May 1 - The League of Women Voters 

today announced its opposition to the Bipartisan Trade Promotion 

Authority Act or &quot;fast track&quot; legislation currently moving forward 

in the U.S. Senate. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;As a long-time supporter of enhanced international trade, we 

are disappointed that the Senate legislation fails to take the 

steps that are needed to bring U.S. trade policy into the 21st 

Century. The legislation, like that passed in the House, is 

backward-looking rather than future oriented,&quot; stated Carolyn 

Jefferson-Jenkins, president of the League of Women Voters of the 

United States. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A recently completed 18-month review of the League's trade 

position reinforced the organization's strong support for a U.S. 

trade policy that reduces trade barriers and expands international 

trade. &quot;The League has long believed that U.S. trade policy should 

be based on the long-term public interest, not on special 

interests. Such a policy helps foster international cooperation, 

democratic values, and economic prosperity at home and abroad,&quot; 

Jefferson-Jenkins stated. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The organizational position was also updated to address the 

importance of social goals, including human rights, the environment 

and labor protections. &quot;Our nation's trade policies must fully 

support practices that advance internationally recognized social 

goals,&quot; emphasized Jefferson-Jenkins. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The pending Senate legislation falls short in two areas,&quot; 

Jefferson-Jenkins noted. &quot;First, it includes a protectionist 

measure for U.S. textiles that will undermine the growth of 

economies and social structures in developing countries. We 

believe that the benefits of international trade should be fairly 

shared, and that U.S. protectionism against developing countries is 

a mistake,&quot; said Jefferson-Jenkins. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Second, the legislation fails to effectively encourage U.S. 

negotiators to achieve basic international standards to protect the 

environment, enhance basic human rights and improve labor 

conditions,&quot; Jefferson-Jenkins added. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The future of international trade must be built around a 

recognition that economic issues do not exist in a vacuum. We must 

make progress across the board on these social goals. The future 

of international trade agreements depends on it,&quot; concluded 

Jefferson-Jenkins. </font></p>
