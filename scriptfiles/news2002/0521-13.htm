- May 21 - Friends of the Earth 

expressed disappointment in the loss of an amendment to trade 

legislation that would have protected environmental standards from 

foreign investor lawsuits. The amendment, offered by Sen. John 

Kerry (D-Mass.), sought to address concerns with investment rules 

like NAFTA's Chapter 11 that allow foreign corporations to bring 

suits against environmental laws and regulations. </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;By voting against the Kerry amendment, the Senate has paved the 

way for more backdoor corporate assaults on laws that protect our 

air, water and land,&quot; said David Waskow, Friends of the Earth's 

trade policy coordinator. &quot;The Senate should be protecting the 

health and safety of Americans, not watching the backs of wealthy 

polluters who make big campaign contributions.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friends of the Earth noted that the close vote indicated a 

growing concern among pro-trade members of Congress about the 

impacts trade agreements have on domestic laws and regulations. In 

particular, environmental groups cited the votes of Sens. Susan 

Collins (R-Maine), Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), Patty Murray 

(D-Wash.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) as evidence of the threat posed by 

Chapter 11. At the same time, the group lambasted pro-environment 

Senators who opposed the amendment. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Unfortunately, Senators Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Dianne 

Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) abandoned their 

environmental principles when their industry friends came calling,&quot; 

said Sara Zdeb, Friends of the Earth's legislative representative. 

&quot;If they think environmentalists will forget this they're 

mistaken.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental groups pointed to Chapter 11 as an issue that 

could tip the scales against fast track when the House of 

Representatives votes on a conference report this summer. Many 

pro-trade House members indicated their concern about the issue 

last year, and a group of Democrats, led by Reps. Jay Inslee 

(D-Wash.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Brian Baird (D-Wash.) 

recently said that a fast track conference report must include the 

Kerry amendment in order for them to support it. </font></p>
